                                 Executive Summary
The twelfth goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development advises countries to
ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) patterns. SCP is a concept of
promoting resource and energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing access to
basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all. It has links to most
SDGs and connects economic processes to the environment and natural resources and
suggests policy instruments and tools to encourage cleaner production and responsible
consumption. SCP is recognized as a fundamental target for mitigating the environmental
degradation and resource depletion that often results from economic growth. To promote
SCP, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 provides specific objectives and targets
addressing –the efficient use of natural resources, reduction of food waste and food loss,
management of chemicals and all wastes through the life cycle, reduction of waste generation,
and rationalization of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. SDG 12 –is increasingly important at
the global and national levels.

Finance is a critical cornerstone of achieving SDGs and economic instruments can help
effectively channel financial resources or incentivize behavioural changes towards SCP.
To meet the financing needed for sustainable development, existing financial systems
including financial intermediaries and financing methods require reshaping and greening, and
a concerted approach that ensures the interplay of different types of financing flows–public
and private, domestic and international–is needed. Shifting the consumption and production
patterns to a sustainable approach requires the effective implementation of existing financial
and economic instruments as well as designing of new ones. Globally, there is a growing
recognition that the market-based instruments (MBIs) are important tools for achieving SCP
and environmental sustainability. MBIs relevant for SDG12 can be classified under two
categories: traditional instruments which are commonly used, such as taxes; charges;
incentives; deposit refund systems; environmentally motivated subsidies; and emerging
instruments like payments for environmental services, green bonds and other private sector
initiatives including voluntary commitments and principles. Furthermore, global discussions
point out that capturing the benefits of innovative instruments would assist countries in their
efforts to finance and implement SDG12.

The Government of Turkey (GoT) is dedicated to incorporating SDGs into its national
plans and policies, and key SCP themes are reflected in some nation-wide and sectoral
strategies. The Ministry of Development (MoD), which is responsible for the overall
coordination with other government agencies on SDG implementation, is planning to
integrate SDGs, including SDG 12, into the upcoming 11th National Development Plan
(NDP). Waste management, agriculture, energy and water are all traditionally considered as
separate policy fields, and comprise part of Turkey’s national approach to resource efficiency
and other key themes of SCP. Currently, together with the 10th Development Plan, about
eighteen national strategies and action plans relevant to SCP are in effect.

However there is more to be done in Turkey to ensure success in SDG implementation.
To effectively implement SCP activities, MoD highlighted the need for developing policy
instruments. It is conducting a stock-taking analysis and expressed an interest in technical
assistance from the World Bank in policy analysis for implementation of SDG12. In a
response to this interest, the World Bank Group prepared the present study which aims to
review Turkey’s on-going efforts as well as international experiences in financing SCP,
                                                                                              9
analyze the gaps, and identify the areas where Turkey may further improve policy
instruments, particularly economic instruments, for implementing SCP activities and
achieving SDG 12.

Turkey has recognized the role of economic policy instruments in achieving its SD
agenda and adopted taxes, charges, subsidies, and support schemes and other MBIs to promote
sustainable development. The application of these instruments also aims to accomplish the
main principles of SCP - promoting resource and energy efficiency, sustainable use of
natural resources, and the reduction of waste and pollution by making such practices
more financially attractive than their alternatives. Turkey’s green financing practices,
including those in its national plans and strategies, do not show much divergence from the
global trends observed in many developed countries.

Neither the national development plans nor the sector-specific strategies and action
plans, however, provide clear insights on the economic instruments or incentives to be
developed for successful implementation of SCP. Green financing is not yet clearly and
consistently defined and elaborated upon in national strategy and programs. Tangible policies
and measures remain insufficient, and existing market-based instruments are inadequate.
Moreover, no comprehensive framework or program has been developed for financial
mechanisms to promote SCP. Therefore, it is necessary that Turkey deepen its understanding
of green financing mechanisms, including the roles of the public and private sector, financial
intermediates, and economic instruments in this domain. It also needs to adopt a policy
framework, provide guidance and effectively mobilize and use both public and private SCP
funding by implementing economic instruments to incentivize stakeholders.

As a priority economic sector and important driver of economic growth in Turkey, the
energy sector takes the first place in terms of available subsidies, support schemes, and
favorable credits which also make positive contributions towards SCPs. Utilization of
domestic renewable energy sources and increasing energy efficiency, and the subsequent
reduction of GHG emissions, are considered as strategic benefits for Turkey. To achieve
these, important reforms were pursued through the enactment of a series of laws, regulations
and strategic plans, including some provision of financial instruments in the Turkish energy
market since 2001. In addition to existing efforts, more are necessary to improve the
investment environment, including regulatory framework, and diversify the energy supply
mix in an environmentally sustainable way. The establishment of a Renewable Energy
Resources Support Mechanism (YEKDEM) and implementation of Renewable Energy
Resource Area (YEKA) are significant steps to support renewable energy production in
Turkey. The recently concluded tender for wind energy is also an indication of progress in
this regard. Bearing in mind its large potential to reduce emissions, energy efficiency
should be supported through the fiscal system, for example by favorable treatment of
expenditures made for that purpose or conferring to energy efficiency a more prominent place
in the overall incentive structure. The government should use national development programs
to scale-up, rationalize, and mainstream financial support for energy efficiency. The
effectiveness of support to SMEs, including soft-loan schemes, grants, and improved access
to financial markets, should also be analyzed and improved without creating undue distortion
in financial markets.
Economic instruments do not yet make an adequate contribution to SCP, and policies
often lack synergy and sometimes contradict each other at the sectoral level. An
example of this is the current financial assistance given to coal mining and favourable
incentives provided for coal-fired power plants. The main concern is that current coal

                                                                                           10
subsidies have high costs associated with the social and environmental externalities and
impacts generated by coal-fired power plants. Although phasing out these subsidies and
reforming the incentive mechanism seems a political challenge in the short- and
medium-term, in order to build a sustainable energy and climate future for the country, coal
subsidies should be evaluated with the perspective of phasing out harmful ones while
increasing the use of renewable energy.

Government incentives for cleaner production, eco-efficiency and waste reduction are
quite limited in Turkey. Although some steps have been taken towards promoting cleaner
production, efforts are mostly project-based and economic instruments are limited in terms of
variety and funding. A notable success was the establishment of the National Eco-Efficiency
(Cleaner Production) Centre for Turkey, which helps transform Turkish industrial enterprises
into more climate-friendly systems with the use of cleaner production and eco-efficiency
applications. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement in terms of developing effective
economic and financial instruments for cleaner production, eco-efficiency and closing
material loops in industry.

Turkey should initiate a process of considering the introduction of new environmental
taxes or amending the existing tax systems to increase their effectiveness and overall
positive impacts. Currently, the only tax based on environmental considerations appears
to be the Environment Cleaning Tax. Turkey has been making advances in aligning its
environmental legislation into the EU acquis since 2009, including the regulations for
environmental tariffs, fees, and charges. Plans and initiatives are also underway for
aligning with the European Emission Trading Scheme. The country’s environmental
agenda, however, seems quite far away from the ongoing discussions in many European
countries about re-designing the existing financial instruments to support SCP,
particularly the growing momentum behind an environmental tax reform agenda. EU
and other international experience could be useful in guiding Turkey to introduce
environmental sustainability concerns into the tax system and adopt effective policy
instruments for SCP.

Natural resource charges or prices should be improved too. Given Turkey’s increasing
population and demand for water, as well as its water resources’ vulnerability to climate
change, the design and implementation of a water resource tax and/or water pricing scheme
deserves special attention. Following the EU Water Framework Directive, Turkey needs to
adopt an effective water pricing or taxation system to implement cost recovery and
polluter/user pays principles in pricing mechanisms, and set the right prices in order to protect
its water resources and improve the efficiency of agricultural, industrial and domestic uses of
water.
While traditional MBIs maintain their importance, international and domestic
experience marks a new period in which the potential for innovative green finance
instruments, such as green bonds, tradable permits, and payments for environmental
services (PES), provide a substantial potential for Turkey to achieve its SCP objectives.
To give an example, Turkish Industrial Development Bank (TSKB) became one of the
first emerging market institutions to issue a green/sustainable bond, the demand for
which was more than thirteen times the amount offered. These tools have been
demonstrated to be a cost-effective and efficient means for directing investments to the
appropriate areas, such as cleaner production technologies and achieving the desired results.
In terms of adopting those new and innovative instruments for better implementing SCP,
Turkey should analyze international experiences in light of its national circumstances, and
                                                                                              11
needs a strong impetus to put these tools into broader operation in Turkey.

Given the large potential of economic instruments and their relative novelty in Turkey, the
introduction and application of economic instruments deserve special attention. Together with
the areas where Turkey performs well, and areas for improvement summarized above, this
Study further identified the following set of recommendations that the Government of Turkey
could consider in its endeavor to finance and implement SDG 12.

1. Developing a National SCP Program. Turkey should initiate a process of developing a
   National SCP Program which would provide a long-term vision for financing and
   implementing SDG 12, specify the roles of the public and private sector, identify priority
   areas and actions, and install a comprehensive set of economic and financial policy
   instruments with predictable, consistent, and reliable results.

2. Improving coherence and integration of sectoral policies for SCP. It is necessary for
   Turkey to conduct a comprehensive review of its SCP-related sectoral, macro-economic
   and fiscal policy portfolio; assess the economic and environmental impacts of the policies,
   and understand how macro-economic, sectoral policies, and fiscal policies in
   non-environmental domains shape up and influence the patterns of consumption and
   production.

3. Seeking synergy between economic instruments and the policy response to climate
   change. SCP policies are closely connected with climate change policies. Therefore,
   Turkey should take into account the long-term climate policies built upon the COP21
   pledge and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and seek synergy between
   SDG 12 and SDG 13 (climate actions). On the way to developing and implementing such
   a comprehensive policy framework, existing financial instruments should be reviewed,
   particularly in the energy and industrial sectors with the largest share of GHG emissions.

4. Learning and sharing experience through strengthened international cooperation
   and public-private dialogue and partnership. Launching a national dialogue on green
   financing and exploring collaborative options across public and private sector banking
   would be a precious step for Turkey to achieve its SCP targets.

5. Monitoring and evaluating SCP financing. Turkey should continue to develop and
   consolidate its SDG indicators with a strengthened data collection, processing and
   evaluation system. Meanwhile, natural capital accounts should be further developed and
   adopted as a monitoring and evaluating tool to support decision making on SCP activities.

6. Setting the right incentives by adopting appropriate economic instruments. In the
   context of SCP, Turkey should improve the design and application of environment-related
   economic measures and MBIs in order to bring about enough incentives and necessary
   behavioral changes to consumers and producers. In this context, Turkey should carefully
   analyze the economic, social and environmental impacts (externalities) of existing coal
   subsidies. From the point of view of energy security, increasing the use of domestic coal
   is an option for reducing dependence on imported carbon fuels, but the environmental
   impacts call for a serious consideration of the reduction, and even phasing out, of these
   subsidies.




                                                                                           12
7. Introducing innovative instruments for financing SCP. Beyond traditional economic
   measures already used in Turkey, the Government of Turkey should try to study and
   experiment with a range of new and innovative economic instruments and international
   good practices that can support the effective implementation of SDG 12, such as green
   loans, green bonds, green infrastructure funds, carbon market, tradable permits, PES, and
   debt for natural swap and find the best situations for introducing them. Furthermore,
   Turkey needs to consider deepening the role of the financial sector in financing
   SCP-related activities and attract capital markets and equity markets as well as pension
   funds and the insurance sector to provide finance to SCP projects.

8. Investing in public education to support SCP. Turkey should develop SCP policies
   hand-in-hand with its education policies in order to promote sustainable lifestyles as well
   as to support new business models with new specialists having the capacity to implement
   sustainable production methods.

                                  I.      Introduction
In September 2015, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by Member
States of the United Nations (UN) at an historic UN Summit. The 2030 Agenda features 17
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets which are built on the
success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and aim to go further to end all forms
of poverty. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development officially came into effect upon
the expiration of MDGs, on 1 January 2016, and will run through 2030. This new universal
agenda will be the international community’s focus in the years to come. SDG
implementation, particularly how to finance it, is critical to the success of the 2030 Agenda.
In order to mobilize the sources of both public and private funding, it is essential to involve
all players and effectively introduce economic and incentive instruments for supporting the
implementation of SDGs on the country level.

Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP), as specifically reflected by SDG 12, is
among the most important SDGs in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SCP is a
holistic approach that minimizes the negative environmental impacts of consumption and
production systems while promoting quality of life for all. From the production side, SCP
refers to a set of cleaner production practices and increasing resource efficiency which are
enabled by innovation and technological change. On the consumption side, SCP implies
changing the consumption patterns of households and governments through changes in
lifestyles and individual consumer behavior and choices, as well as through changes to
procurement strategies in the public sector. SDG 12 and its targets cover a very broad area.
Mapping links it to 14 other SDGs, making it the most interlinked one (Le Blanc 2015). Thus,
it will both contribute to and be helped by the progress in other SDGs. Therefore, policies and
actions associated with SDG 12 need to be considered not in isolation, but within a cluster of
related goals and targets. As demonstrated for the EU (Coopman, et al., 2016), this will help
to reinforce synergies that magnify the positive results and avoid unintended consequences.

The Government of Turkey (GoT) is dedicated to taking action for the successful
implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it welcomes the universal
and integrated nature of SDGs. Main issues of implementing the 17 SDGs are translating
global goals into national programs and designing sustained financing solutions. In this
regard, the GoT aims to reflect the objectives of the 2030 Agenda into its national plans and
policies. Particularly the Turkish Ministry of Development (MoD), which is responsible for
the coordination of SDG implementation within the GoT, plans to integrate SDG
implementation into the upcoming 11th National Development Plan (NDP) for 2019-2023.
Transforming existing consumption and production patterns into a sustainable system is a
priority for Turkey not only to mitigate environmental impacts, but also to use natural
resources effectively and safeguard economic development in the long run. In addition to
coordinating with other line ministries on various SDGs, MoD is particularly interested in the
issues of economic instruments to support SCP targets under SDG 12.

The World Bank (WB) and other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) are committed to
helping national governments integrate their development agendas with the SDGs and
supporting the design and use of economic instruments to ensure their effective
implementation. As a longstanding partner of the Turkish Government, the WB aims to
assist the GoT in its efforts to implement SDGs, particularly SDG 12, and to integrate the

                                                                                            14
SDGs and targets into the 11th NDP. The purpose of this report is to review Turkey’s
on-going efforts as well as international experience in implementing economic instruments to
support SCP as specified in SDG 12, analyze the gaps, and discuss areas where Turkey may
better adopt economic instruments and other incentive policies for promoting SCP in the new
NDP.

The Study contains six chapters. Following this introduction, Chapter 2 provides an overview
of Turkey’s involvement in the global sustainable development agenda, a summary of SDG12
and key themes of SCP. Chapter 3 introduces the conceptual framework on green financing,
and summarizes international experience on the use of economic instruments with a focus on
SCP. Chapter 4 explores the Turkish context of economic instruments to support SCP and
reviews existing economic policies and instruments. Areas for improvement and
recommendations are presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 provides concluding remarks.

        II.     Implementation of Sustainable Development Goals in
                                   Turkey
2.1 Turkey’s Involvement in the Global Sustainable Development Agenda:
From MDGs to SDGs
Turkey has been contributing to the global sustainable development agenda since the 1992
Rio Summit, and has had a fairly successful record with regards to achieving MDGs over the
past 15 years. The GoT has installed MDGs in its national development priorities and has
made considerable achievements on most of the goals. For the goals of eradicating extreme
poverty, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, providing and improving safe
water and sanitation facilities, and building global partnerships for development, Turkey is
among the top ten performers as measured by average annual rates of relative progress. In
contrast, less progress has been observed in gender equality, empowering women, and
environmental sustainability (MoD, 2015).

According to mdgTrack, a global portal designed to track progress on these MDGs over more
than 140 locations worldwide using the World Bank MDGs database, the Global Index for
Turkey is 64%, which represents results of the mean average of each goal's percentage of
completion. Turkey is indicated as being “on track? for the year 2020. As mentioned above,
Turkey had shortcomings in achieving targets under Goal 3 (Promoting gender equality and
empowering women) and Goal 7 (Ensuring environmental sustainability). In terms of
environmental sustainability, particularly the increase in terrestrial protected areas and
decrease in CO2 emissions, it could not have been achieved as of 2015 (TAC mdgTrack).

Furthermore, while not a part of MDGs process, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) has carried
out studies on sustainable development indicators with respect to the European Union
Statistical Office’s (Eurostat) sustainable development indicators set since 2007. Sustainable
development indicators consist of 132 benchmarks defined by Eurostat under the following 10
themes: (1) Socioeconomic development, (2) Sustainable consumption and production, (3)
Social inclusion, (4) Demographic changes, (5) Public health, (6) Climate change and energy,
(7) Sustainable transport, (8) Natural resources, (9) Global partnership, and (10) Good
governance. In general, indicators are calculated by relevant units of TurkStat and the rest are
collected from other ministries or agencies. 1

Turkey has been actively involved in intergovernmental negotiations during the Post-2015
discussions. In a group with Italy and Spain, Turkey joined Open Working Group meetings
and contributed to overall discussions. Turkey’s emphasis was mainly shaped around a
human-centered development approach. During the intergovernmental sessions (MoD, 2015),
economic growth, education, health, employment, cooperation and governance issues had
been its priority areas. In addition to governmental efforts, Turkey was among the first 50
countries selected for national consultations on the Post-2015 development agenda. UN
Country Team has initiated a country dialogue process with open and inclusive consultations
around the post-2015 agenda.

2.2 Initial Steps Taken Toward Implementing SDGs in Turkey
GoT is dedicated to taking action for the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. It welcomes the universal and integrated nature of SDGs and aims
to reflect the 2030 Agenda’s objectives into the country’s national plans and policies. As a
signal of this strong desire, Turkey was among the 22 countries presenting voluntary national
reviews at the first UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF) held in July 2016. The Ministry of
Development has been the main government authority for coordinating and convening the
technical work shaping the post 2015 process both within Turkey and on international
platforms. In line with this experience, MoD continues to coordinate the overall process for
the implementation of SDGs in Turkey.

Since September 2015, MoD is conducting some preliminary analyses to display the national
circumstances for the implementation of SDGs and has declared that SDGs, and its
complementary Addis Ababa Action Agenda, will be integrated in the upcoming 11th National
Development Plan (NDP), which tops the development planning and policy making processes
in Turkey. Furthermore, the government has stressed that SDG implementation will be the
shared responsibility of all ministries, and thus the integration of SDGs into all relevant
strategy and policy documents at the national and local levels will be ensured through this
collaborative approach (MoD, 2016a).

On the institutional side, the structure and role of the existing National Sustainable
Development Commission (NSDC) would be strengthened and widened taking the
comprehensive nature of the 2030 Agenda into account. The NSDC will play a role in the
follow-up and review process of SDG implementation, while MoD will undertake its
coordination duties. Further, the Government guarantees a national setting that will help
ensure effective contributions from all relevant stakeholders for the SDG planning,
implementation and review process.

Regarding follow-up and review, Turkey intends to develop a review framework that
conforms with the UN framework of monitoring and review. In line with that, National SDG
Review Reports are expected to be prepared on a periodical basis, in consideration of the
HLPF agenda. In terms of monitoring the SDGs at a national level, TurkStat will play a
central role in developing a national monitoring framework in light of SDGs’ global
indicators. It is expected that Turkey will develop its current set of indicators taking into
account results of UN Statistics work for a global common monitoring framework as well as
the SDG’s national priority list (MoD, 2016a).

2.3 SDG 12 and Its Relevance with Turkey

2.3.1 The Meaning of Sustainable Consumption and Production

The need for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) was first highlighted at the
1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janerio. World leaders
acknowledged that “the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment
is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production.? Two years later, the first
definition, known as Oslo Definition, of SCP was proposed at the 1994 Oslo Symposium on
Sustainable Consumption as “the use of services and related products, which respond to basic
needs and bring a better quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources and
toxic materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the

                                                                                          17
service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of further generations.? Almost two
decades on, the definition of SCP has evolved as “a holistic approach to minimising the
negative environmental impacts from consumption and production systems while promoting
quality of life for all? which was developed by United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)
in 2011.

Later, the SCP was recognized in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, adopted at the
World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. The Johannesburg Plan of
Implementation called on all countries to promote sustainable consumption and production
patterns. Paragraph 15 of the Plan says "Encourage and promote the development of a
10-year framework of programmes (10YFP) in support of regional and national initiatives to
accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production to promote social and
economic development within the carrying capacity of ecosystems." This would form the
foundation of the so-called Marrakech Process, an informal multi-stakeholder approach to
promoting the implementation of policies and capacity building on SCP and to support the
development of a 10 Year Framework of Programmes on SCP. (UN, 2017)

SCP aims to do more and better with less, i.e., to fulfill the needs of people and increase
welfare from economic activities by using less resources, including energy and water, and
producing less waste and pollution both at the supply (production) and demand (consumption)
side. To be more specific, on the production side the objective of SCP is to reduce
material/energy intensity of economic activities and reduce emissions and wastes. While on
the consumption side, the objective is to promote a shift of consumption patterns towards
groups of goods and services with lower energy and material intensity without compromising
quality of life. Therefore, application of the life-cycle method plays a fundemental role for
both sides (UNEP, 2015).

Given these broad parameters of SCP, different sustainability issues are addressed under
different SCP efforts based on the priorities, cultural and economical dynamics and
behavioural patterns of each region or country. For instance, as part of the global Marrakech
Process on SCP, The African 10YFP embodies four main thematic priority areas: energy,
water and sanitation, habitat and sustainable urban development; and industrial development.
Whereas in the European Union, there have been extensive efforts on European consumer and
producer behaviour and several Directives by EU member states. On the other hand, China
and the Republic of Korea have Green Growth Strategies, which address several objectives
towards SCP. And as another example, Canada, like many countries, does not have a national
strategy for SCP but has specific policies for different sectors, such as the Canadian Green
Procurement Policy. (UNEP, 2015).

SCP is one of the most important components of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. Goal 12 of the Agenda aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production
patterns. Paragraph 28 of the 2030 Agenda reads:

   “We (Countries) commit to making fundamental changes in the way that our societies
   produce and consume goods and services. Governments, international organizations,
   the business sector and other non-state actors and individuals must contribute to
   changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns, including through the
   mobilization, from all sources, of financial and technical assistance to strengthen
   developing countries’ scientific, technological and innovative capacities to move
   towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production. We encourage the

                                                                                          18
   implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable
   Consumption and Production. All countries take action, with developed countries
   taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing
   countries?.

The 2030 Agenda also defines SCP as an integral component of SDGs, and SCP is reflected
as a cross-cutting enabler for the achievement of many SDGs. In particular, there are several
SCP-related targets placed under different SDGs related to agriculture, water, energy and
economic growth. To be more specific, Target 2.4 under SDG 2 (Goal 2. End hunger, achieve
food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture), Target 6.4 under
SDG 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all),
Target 7.2 and Target 7.3 under SDG7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and
modern energy for all), and Target 8.4 under SDG8 (Promote sustained, inclusive and
sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all) have
close relationship to achieving SCP patterns. Goal 12 consists of eight targets, plus three
targets for means of implementation and thirteen indicators for monitoring the progress.
Please see Annex 1 for the list of targets and indicators under SDG12.

2.3.2 Key SCP Issues in Turkey

Turkey has witnessed dynamic change and a rapid growth since the beginning of the 2000s.
Since then the country’s GDP has almost tripled in nominal U.S. dollar terms. Turkey’s per
capita income of roughly US$11,000 places it in the group of upper-middle-income countries.
With a population close to 80 million, the country has become the world’s 17th-largest
economy (World Bank, 2016). Turkey is a member of the G20 and the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Industrialization has been a main driver of Turkey’s economic growth, which also leads to a
rapid increase in the share of population living in urban areas. Today, about 77 percent of the
country’s population lives in urban areas. However, with these achievements and changes
have come significant environmental challenges. Increasing demands for energy, water, food
and other resources have resulted in the over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution, soil
erosion as well as fragmentation, degradation and loss of natural habitats. In particular,
increase in energy and water demand were significant over the past decades. For instance, the
country’s total final consumption of energy has increased by 35.8% in all sectors since 2004
(IEA, 2016). Likewise, water demand has approximately doubled in the second half of the last
century and due to an enormous population increase from 28 million in the 1960’s to 77
million in 2017, the availability of water resources has decreased from around 4000 m 3 to
1500 m3 per capita/year today (MoEF, 2010).

Turkey’s economic growth has also been accompanied by a remarkable increase in
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions over the same period. According to TurkStat’s GHG
Emissions Inventory, the total GHG emissions in Turkey were equivalent to 316.9 million
tons CO2 in 2004. In 2014, it reached to 468 million tons CO2 (excluding LULUCF) with a
125% increase compared to the 1990 emissions. Looking at the GHG emissions by sectors in
2014, energy (electricity generation, manufacturing, transport, residential etc.) and industrial
processes are the top two sectors with the largest share of GHG emissions–72.4% and 13.2%,
respectively. The share of agriculture and waste sector related emissions are 10.4% and
3.4% respectively (TurkStat, 2014a). It is remarkable though, that demand in Turkey has
grown substantially for green buildings that use less energy. This placed Turkey at the

                                                                                             19
number nine spot on US Green Building Council’s annual ranking of the Top 10 Countries for
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Demand for upmarket and luxury
housing, however, seems to emphasize “smart? houses with much electronic gadgetry rather
than energy efficiency (Arsan 2008).

Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) measures the total amount of materials directly used
by an economy 2 . Materials are classified in four main categories: biomass, metal ores,
non-metallic minerals and fossil energy materials. Turkey’s DMC was 931 million tonnes in
2014. Country’s DMC has increased by 58% between 2004 and 2014, which indicates
Turkey’s economic growth and rising resource use went hand-in-hand over the past 15 years.
Looking at the domestic material consumption by main categories in EU28 countries and
Turkey as shown in Figure 1, with per capita resource use of 11.9 tonnes, Turkey stands
below the EU28 average of 13.1 tonnes per capita (EEA, 2016b). In Turkey, by far the largest
material consumption category was non-metallic minerals, mostly materials used in the
construction sector.

Tracking the resource efficiency of economies is one way of understanding whether a country
is progressing towards sustainable development. The terms “resource efficiency? and
“resource productivity? are often used to describe the amount of natural resources-measured
as DMC—used to produce one unit of economic activity—measured as GDP (EEA, 2016).

2
  DMC is defined as the annual quantity of raw materials extracted from the domestic territory, plus all physical
imports minus all physical exports.

                                                                                                               20
   Although Turkey’s resource productivity has increased from 0.55 Euro/kg in 2004 to 0.75
   Euro/kg in 2014, it is still much below the EU28 average of 1.98 Euro/kg.

   With regard to the waste sector, thanks to the help of regulatory requirements which have
   been mainly adopted from EU environmental directives over the last 10 years, municipal and
   industrial waste management services (collection, separation, transportation, disposal, and
   recovery) have improved in Turkey. A vast majority of the population—91%—lives in
   municipal areas served by municipal waste services that cover collection, separation and the
   transportation of municipal solid waste. In Turkey, about 28 million tons of municipal waste
   have been collected in 2014 (TurkStat, 2014b). According to 2016 National Waste
   Management Plan and Action Plan data, 61% of the municipal waste is sent to sanitary
   landfills and 28% is dumped at municipal dumpsites. Waste recycling and recovery services
   remain low compared to developed countries, probably owing to a lack of education and
   consciousness on environmental and economic merits of recycling as well as weakness of
   economic measures such as deposit return systems. With regards to muncipal waste, only
   11% was reported as recycled (packaging waste included), composted or disposed of by other
   recycling methods. However, the number of licensed recycling and recovery facilities has
   rapidly increased over the last decade. In 2003, there were 46 recycling and recovery facilities
   for different recyclable wastes, whereas by 2015 the number of licensed facilities had
   increased to 1,226 (EEA, 2016b). On the other hand, Turkey with a per capita average of 405
   kg/year of generated municipal waste, falls below the EU28 average of 475 kg/year (EuroStat,
   2016a). In terms of the manufacturing industry, approximately 15.7 million tonnes of waste
   was generated in 2014, about 6.3% of this was hazardous waste (TurkStat 2014c). The values
   of key SCP indicators for Turkey and for EU28 are presented in Table 1 below.

   Similar to many other countries, Turkey does not have a National Sustainable Consumption
   and Production Strategy or Action Plan. Instead, key SCP themes are mostly incorporated in
   nation-wide and sectoral strategies and policies such as the national development plan, and
   strategy and action plans on energy, waste, agriculture, industrial development and the
   environment. Furthermore, waste management, energy and water are traditionally considered
   as separate policy fields, and represent an important part of Turkey’s national approach to
   resource efficiency and other key SCP themes. Table 2 below summarizes the national
   strategies and action plans related to key themes of SCP in addition to the 10th Development
   Plan.

   The concept of Ecological Footprint may also provide useful insights to better understand the
   impacts of economic decisions on a country’s natural resources, and help to measure the level
   of sustainability in an alternative way. To put it simply, footprint and bio-capacity accounting
   helps us answer this basic question: How much do people demand from biologically
   productive surfaces (Ecological Footprint) compared to how much the planet can (or a
   country's productive surface) regenerate on those surfaces (bio-capacity)? Global Footprint
   Network (GFN), a global non-profit organization, calculates the National Footprint Accounts
   to measure ecological resource use and the resource capacity of nations over time. Based on
   the 2016 edition of GFN’s National Footprint Accounts, Turkey’s total ecological footprint

                                                                                                            22
was 3.3 global hectares per capita (gha) in 2012, which was higher than world average (2.8
gha). The following box demonstrates the concept of ecological footprint and key figures for
Turkey’s ecological footprint in more details (GFN, 2016).

        Box 1. An Important Indicator for Measuring Sustainability: Ecological Footprint

The Ecological Footprint is the area of land and water it takes for a human population to generate the renewable
resources it consumes and to absorb the corresponding waste it generates, using prevailing technology. In other
words, it measures the "quantity of nature" that we use and compares it with how much "nature" we have. If the
Ecological Footprint exceeds bio-capacity, it means human demands on renewable resources (such as forest
products and crops) and CO2 absorption will be unsustainable in the long term.

According to an analysis conducted by Global Footprint Network (GFN), in the global scale, ecological footprint
was 2.8 gha per capita in 2012. For the same year, bio-capacity per capita was calculated as 1.73 gha which
indicates a bio-capacity deficit of 1.1 gha per person. This global bio-capacity debt, also called “overshoot,? is
gradually growing as the population increases.

Ecological Footprint of Turkey
Based on the 2016 edition of GFN’s National Footprint Accounts, Turkey’s total ecological footprint was 3.3
gha in 2012, which was higher than the world average (2.8 gha) and lower than the EU-27 average (4.8 gha).
The total bio-capacity (gha per capita) for Turkey was 1.5 gha, meaning that country’s bio-capacity deficit is 1.8
gha. In other words, if every individual on earth would consume as much as an average Turkish citizen,
humanity would need 1.9 planets.

As Turkey consumes its natural resources faster than the speed at which they can renew themselves, since 1989,
it has been running a bio-capacity deficit and has become a net bio-capacity importer, which means the
Ecological Footprint of consumption in the country has partly depended on resources from abroad. The main
reason Turkey transformed from being a country with “bio -capacity reserve? to being a country with
“bio-capacity deficit? is its population increase and changing consumption patterns with the rise of wealth

Similar to many other countries, the biggest denominator of Turkey’s total ecological footprint is of carbon
origin with 1.9 gha in 2012. Looking at the country’s footprint trends, it can be observed to have increased for all

                                                                                                                 23
six land categories (carbon sequestration areas, agricultural lands, forests, grazing lands, fisheries and built-up
areas) between the years 1961 and 2012, but the highest increase occurred in carbon footprint. The largest share
in CO2 emissions that constitute the carbon footprint belongs to the electricity sector.

According to Turkey’s Ecological Footprint Analysis conducted by WWF-Turkey and GFN in 2012, if existing
resource use trends continue, increasing economic welfare, overcoming ecological crises and maintaining
ecological services will become much harder with the growing ecological debt. According to the best case
scenario developed within the Analysis, which is based on investments in efficient technologies and restoration
of bio-capacity, Turkey can begin to close this ecological debt. The Analysis also concludes that sustainable
natural resource use can be achieved through integrated policies which provide economical durability in addition
to welfare increases and which include sustainable production and consumption models and measures to protect
biodiversity (WWF-Turkey, 2012).

      III. Overview of International Experience in Supporting
             Sustainable Consumption and Production
This chapter presents the conceptual framework for green financing and a short overview of
the international experience in using economic instruments to support the key themes of
SDG12 – the efficient use of natural resources, reduction of food waste and food loss,
management of chemicals and all wastes through life cycle, reduction of waste generation,
and rationalization of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The chapter presents the commonly
used and some emerging economic instruments (particularly market-based instruments), and
demonstrates their application to support SDG12 through examples from OECD countries.
However, due to the limited timeframe of the study, it is not intended as a comprehensive
inventory of all existing instruments covering all key themes of the SDG12.

3.1Conceptual Framework and Global Trends of Green Financing
Green financing is understood as the financing of investments that provide environmental
benefits in the broader context of environmentally sustainable development (UNEP, 2016).
Understanding the concept of sustainability has changed dramatically over time: from the
Stockholm Convention in 1972, which introduced the idea of sustainability into the political
agenda; to the Earth Summit in 1992, which opened a new era of ‘Sustainable Development’;
and to the present, when political and economic agendas are shaped around concepts like
sustainable value creation, green growth, and green economy (European Commission, 2011).
This evolution led to changes in the role of actors and mechanisms to finance sustainable
development.

Shaping financial policies and systems to meet the financing needs of sustainable
development requires a clear mapping of current financial flows, key actors and instruments.
The UN Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing has
conducted significant analyses and proposed options on an effective sustainable development
financing strategy to facilitate the mobilization of resources and their effective use in
achieving sustainable development objectives. As illustrated in Figure 4 prepared by the
Committee, sustainable development financing comes from two main sources: public and
private, which can be further divided into domestic and international flows. Furthermore,
financing decisions, whether public or private, are influenced by national policy frameworks
and the international financial landscape; financing institutions (actors) and the design and
development of instruments. Thus, in each category of finance, funding decision is dispersed
among multiple actors with different types of instruments (UN, 2014).

In that regard, meeting financing needs for sustainable development requires developing a
concerted approach that ensures the interplay of different types of financing flows while
increasing their effectiveness, coordinated efforts between those multiple actors and the
synchronized mobilization of various financing instruments to maximize their impacts. It is
also critical that these financing streams should complement–but not substitute for–each
other. While public finance is necessary to increase equity through poverty reduction and
provide public goods and services, private finance should be an important driver for
transforming the market to a greener and more inclusive one by fostering environmental and
social change.

All four types of finance, public and private, domestic and international, have increased since
the beginning of the 2000s, with domestic finance representing by far the greatest share of
financing sources for sustainable development in most countries. From the environmental
point of view, the public sector has always dominated investments in conservation. A survey
on a limited number of public institutions shows public investment in the production of
sustainable food and fiber, habitat conservation, and water quality and quantity and tracked
the public capital committed to conservation at USD31.7 billion from 2009-2015 –this figure
is a major underestimation as it was based on the responses of only 6 public organizations
(Ecosystem Marketplace, 2016). Historically, many policy actions – such as fiscal measures
(taxes and subsidies), environmental regulations, and emissions trading schemes – were
undertaken to address negative environmental externalities, such as waste disposal and water
and air pollution. These actions have been critical to improving the environment, but
remained insufficient for mobilizing private capital for green investment in many countries.



                                                                                                                      26
Over the past decade, the agenda of many private sector corporations has shifted from
objectives for maximizing profits to strategies that promote innovative technologies and a
more efficient use of natural resources (ODI/DIE/ECDPM, 2011). As a result, the role of the
private sector in green financing has increased dramatically. The total committed private
capital was tracked at USD8 billion3 during the period 2009-2015, primarily in the area of
sustainable food and fiber production (Ecosystem Marketplace, 2016). In addition to direct
investments, innovative mechanisms such as payments for environmental services (PES) have
been successfully implemented in the areas of water and biodiversity conservation.

Furthermore, financial markets have recently emerged to address natural resource challenges.
Examples include voluntary commitments and principles, better risk assessment
methodologies and innovative financial products such as green bonds and green infrastructure
investment vehicles (UNEP, 2016). The green bond market has grown from about USD4
billion in 2010 to no less than USD50 billion in 2016 (European Commission, 2016a; CBI,
2015). The next sections present a typology of market-based instruments, and their
applications in the OECD countries.

3.2Economic Instruments to Support SDG12
There is no universally accepted classification that captures the wide range of instruments
used to support SDG12 (and, when possible, to finance green investments). Different
organizations provide different classifications, usually focusing on a sub-set of instruments. In
1998, the World Bank developed a policy matrix that captured traditional instruments to: use
markets (subsidy reduction, environmental taxes, user fees, deposit-refund systems and
targeted subsidies); create markets (property rights/decentralization, tradable permits/rights,
international offset systems); use environmental regulations (standards, bans, permits, and
quotas), and engage the public (public participation and information disclosure) (World Bank,
1998).

Other classifications focus only on instruments related to financial markets: through equity
(indices, mutual funds, and exchange traded funds); fixed-income (green bonds) and
alternative asset classes (real estate funds and infrastructure funds) (EDHEC, 2010). Annex 2
provides more details on financial vehicles for green investing. Finally, OECD (2013)
classifies the instruments into taxes; charges; tradable permit systems; deposit refund systems;
environmentally motivated subsidies; and voluntary approaches.

Drawing on the above publications, and particularly on the OECD work, this chapter focuses
on economic instruments, particularly market-based instruments, both traditional and newly
developed. Table 3 provides a summary overview of the most common and some emerging
instruments relevant for supporting SDG 12. It is not intended as a comprehensive inventory
of all existing instruments. A certain degree of overlapping exists among some measures, e.g.
measures to phase out environmentally harmful subsidies may cover taxes; private sector
initiatives may use PES or green bonds.

  Based on responses provided by 98 private organizations that reported making conservation commitments, out of a total of
128 organizations responding to the survey. The investors reported committing USD6.5 billion towards sustainable food and
fiber production across all years (2004-2015), which is nearly 4 times as much as the capital reported in the categories of
habitat conservation, water quality, and quantity. Organizations headquartered in North America supplied nearly two thirds of
all responses; the bulk of the remaining responses were from Europe, and a few were from Africa, Asia and Latin America
(Ecosystem Marketplace, 2016).

3.3Application of Economic Instruments in OECD Countries
This section demonstrates the application of economic instruments to support SDG12. It
should be noted that some of them (e.g. taxes, charges, PES) can be direct means for green
financing, if the generated revenues are used for funding investments that provide
environmental benefits. Others can support SCP by creating signals that change the behavior
of consumers or producers, without directly financing green investments. For example,
tradable permit systems can create an incentive for the private sector to incorporate pollution
abatement into production or consumption decisions, and to innovate in a way to continually
search for the least costly method of abatement5.

In many cases, European countries such as Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands have
been chosen as case studies, due to their advanced environmental protection policies.
Whenever known, the paragraphs below describe the success (or failure) achieved by
implementing these instruments. The examples are drawn based on a review of several
studies, such as OECD (2013), ECORYS (2011), Parry (2011), RFF (2011), IEEP (2012),
OECD (2007), WWF (2002), European Commission (2016a) and Ecosystem Marketplace
(2016).

Traditional instruments

Taxes and charges. Environmentally related taxes usually increase the costs of a polluting
product or activity, which tends to discourage its production or consumption. Tax bases
usually cover energy products, transport (equipment and services), pollution (emissions to air
and water, as well as waste management), and natural resources (management of water, land,
soil, forests, biodiversity, etc.). Energy related taxes generate most of the revenue, while the
amounts raised on other environmentally related tax-bases (waste, measured air or water
pollution, hazardous chemicals, etc.) are modest. Denmark, Turkey and the Netherlands are
the three OECD countries that raise the most revenue from environmental taxes (in terms of
% of GDP, Figure 5). In addition, Denmark and the Netherlands offer good examples of broad
tax bases, which provide not only an increase in revenues, but also a more sustainable
exploitation of natural resources. In Turkey, increasing the rate of the fuel consumption tax
over time in order to generate funds for the budget (and not for SCP related objectives) has
resulted in an increase in the share of environmental taxes in total tax receipts. Environmental

benefits from public finance reforms would be small when price elasticities are low because
while tax receipts increase, the consumption of the environmentally harmful product or the
resultant environmentally harmful practice does not decrease much.

Data on charges is generally not as good as for taxes, partly because charges are collected
primarily by local governments. Box 2 provides some examples of environmental taxes and
charges applied in the OECD countries.

                   Box 2. Examples of environmental taxes and charges in the OECD

Water tax. To reduce water usage, the Netherlands introduced a groundwater tax in 1995, and a tap water tax in
2000. The ground water tax is levied on the extraction of ground water – the extracting parties mainly being
water companies and industry. The tap water tax is levied on the delivery of tap water (the quantity delivered to
the consumer) and paid by the domestic water supply companies. As a result, total drinking water use declined,
with water consumption from businesses reducing at a faster rate, between 2% and 12% of initial consumption.

Pesticide tax. Denmark and Sweden adopted national action plans to reduce pesticide use through education,
increased control, and a pesticide tax. In Denmark, the pesticide tax (which increased from 37% of the wholesale
tax in 1996 to 54% in 1998) had no impact on pesticide use because retailers cut the prices to counteract the tax
increase. In Sweden, concerted efforts to reduce pesticide use (pesticide tax, training farmers, ban on harmful
pesticides, integrated pest management) resulted in a 60% reduction of active substance pesticide use. It is
believed that the price signal from the tax is relatively weak, and that the greatest share of benefits is due to other
efforts related to the reduction of pesticide use (e.g. training).

Plastic bag tax. The Irish Plastic Bag Levy was introduced in 2002. It is charged on each plastic bag provided
by retailers, and levied at the point of sale, with retailers collecting it on behalf of the tax office. The levy is part
of a wider policy on waste and packaging that complies with EU standards. It was introduced at EUR0.15 per
bag in 2002, and increased to EUR0.22 per bag in 2007. The levy had a dramatic initial impact, decreasing bag
use by approximately 90% overnight. However bag usage began increasing again over time, but then dropped
after the levy increased, only to increase again. The levy has been successful from an anti-litter point of view,
reducing bags from an estimated 5% of all recorded litter in 2000 to less than 0.3% in 2009, and the scheme has
proved popular with consumers. In the United States (District of Columbia), businesses that sell food or alcohol

in 2010 introduced a tax of 5 cents for each disposable or plastic carryout bag 6 . The tax has reduced bag
consumption considerably; in addition, part of the tax revenue is channelled to the Anacostia River Clean Up and
Protection Fund, designed to remove trash from the Anacostia River.

Effluent charges. Within the framework of the Effluent Charges Act, Germany introduced effluent charges in
a few states in 1981, and then extended them to the entire country. According to the Act, charges must be paid
whenever treated wastewater is discharged into a body of water. The average wastewater charge increased from
EUR2.18 per m3 in 2001 to EUR2.36 per m3 in 2010. These charges have had positive impacts by inducing a
high level of compliance to the best available technology standards. However, since these charges intersect with
other standards (e.g. BAT standards of the Federal Water Act), it is not possible to assess the independent effects
that effluent charges have on the environment.

There have been other environmental taxes/charges implemented in the EU –such as tree protection charges in
Austria and Lithuania, tax on the extraction of gravel in Sweden, carbon tax on fuel in Mauritius, and other
natural resource taxes, for example in Latvia (i.e. on water, waste, mineral resources) and Finland (i.e. on
mining extraction, fishing, forest management).

Tradable permits. Tradable emission permits are major pollution control instruments
addressing air pollution, particularly in the EU and USA. The SO2 emission-trading scheme
established in the US under the Acid Rain Program of the Clean Air Act (Clean Air Act
Amendments 1990) was among the first comprehensive and successful scheme. Another
example is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), which operates in 31
countries, and covers 45% of the EU’s GHG emissions. The experience with emission trading
systems has been largely positive: For example, within the EU-ETS, emissions have already
fallen by 5% compared to the 2013 levels (European Commission, 2017b). Australia has used
nutrient trading at sewage treatment plants (UNEP 2004).

In addition, several European countries have recently introduced domestic emissions trading
systems. For example, the United Kingdom uses domestic tradable emission systems to
address CO2 emissions (separately from the EU-wide scheme) and disposal of biodegradable
waste. These systems are applied in combination with environmentally related taxes
addressing the same environmental problem. This reflects a widespread tendency in
environmental policy to rely on a mix of instruments, rather than employing market
mechanisms alone (OECD, 2008).

Deposit-refund systems. Deposit-refunds are currently used for several products, such as
beverage containers, lead-acid batteries, motor oil, tires, hazardous materials, and electronics.
Box 3 outlines examples of such systems. Generally speaking, they have yielded positive
effects for the environment by reducing material loss and potential environmental damage;
however, they do not prevent such damage entirely, and the effectiveness of these approaches
in directing consumers towards more sustainable behavior is difficult to quantify (ECORYS,
2011).

                                     Box 3. Examples of deposit refund-schemes

Containers. Oregon passed the first bottle bill, or container deposit law, in the United States, in 1971. The law
imposed a deposit on all beer and soft drink containers which would be refunded upon the containers’ return for
recycling. As of mid-2011, ten states and eight Canadian provinces had some kind of bottle bill. Germany and
Denmark introduced container-deposit schemes (for aluminum, paper, glass, etc.) in 2002-2003, which resulted
in increased recycling and a significant decline in waste disposal.

Batteries. Forty-four states in the United States have some kind of deposit-refund program for lead acid
batteries. Many states used model legislation developed by the Battery Council International (BCI), which
recommends that retailers charge a USD10 fee (deposit) on all batteries sold, with the fee waived or returned if
the customer brings back a used battery for recycling within 30 –45 days of purchase. As the lead in batteries is
valuable, 86 percent of batteries were recycled even without the deposit refund system. Widespread adoption of
the deposit-refund approach increased the recycling rate for lead-acid batteries to 97 percent.

Electronics. The recycling of electronic products, such as computers, televisions, cell phones, and other items
that make up a growing fraction of the waste stream, is difficult and costly. The approach that many European
countries hve adopted to address the problem is product take back, or what has come to be known as extended
producer responsibility. These programs mandate that manufacturers take back products from consumers at the
end of the product’s life, and ensure that a specific fraction of the material contained in the products is recycled.

Other deposit-refund systems relate to the disposal of (1) tires: the United States applies fees on tire purchases,
which typically range from USD0.50 to USD2 for passenger vehicle tires, and from USD3 to USD5 for heavy
truck tires. These deposits are not generally refunded to consumers; instead the revenues collected are used to
subsidize scrap tire processors or sales of products made from scrap tires. (2) motor oil: Canada has a national
used motor oil recycling program that relies on a fee paid by all wholesale suppliers of motor oil, oil filters, and
containers. The collected fee revenues are used to pay a return incentive to collectors and processors who deliver
used oil to government-approved processing facilities.

Environmentally motivated subsidies. There is no universally accepted definition of this
term. For example, OECD (2006) relates it to its motive of inducing environmentally friendly
actions (OECD, 2006). Relevant examples include the EU’s common agricultural policy,
which provides farmers income support conditional to their adopting environmentally
sustainable farming methods (European Commission, 2016b) and subsidies for the production
of renewable energy, as a way to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. Such subsidies can
take on many forms, including: biofuels used for road transport and biomass (e.g. grants,
government loans at preferential rates, loan guarantees); technologies that produce electricity
from renewable energy (e.g. subsidy of production costs; regulations that a certain proportion
of electricity in a service area be provided by renewable energy; and feed-in tariffs7). Several
emerging countries have also introduced feed-in tariffs renewable portfolio standards, or
tradable certificates to support the expansion of renewable energy-based electricity, including
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, India, the Philippines and Turkey (IEA/OPEC/OECD/World
Bank, 2010).

Other definitions relate this term with measures that reduce the use of something that has a
proven, specific negative impact on the environment (OECD, 2013). In this light, such
measures are mostly linked to phasing out harmful environmental subsidies (EHS) (e.g.
subsidizing water for irrigation which stimulates inefficient use of water; higher taxation of
diesel vs. petrol which generates higher emissions; reduced value added tax (VAT) for energy
use leads to increased emissions and inefficient use of fossil fuels). The need to reform
ineffective or harmful public subsidies has long been recognized, and the EU has a
long-standing commitment to phasing out EHS. Box 4 presents some examples of successful
EHS reforms (some of which overlap with fiscal measures). Overall, progress in EHS reform
remains slow, as seen in the limited reporting by Member States on plans to identify and
phase out EHS as part of their National Reform Programs (IEEP, 2012).

Elimination of reduced excise tax rate for diesel used in agricultural machinery. The Netherlands applies
two distinct excise tax rates to diesel fuel. Diesel used as a propellant for motor vehicles using public roads
(‘white’ diesel) is taxed at a rate of EUR0.43 per litre while diesel used for other purposes (‘red’ diesel) is
charged at EUR0.26 per litre. Starting in 2013, this distinction disappeared, with all diesel being taxed at the
‘white’ (higher) rate.

Reduction of energy tax exemptions for companies. In 2011 the energy tax refund granted to German
companies was reduced from 95% to 90% (peak equalization scheme) and from 40% to 25% (for all companies).
In 2012 a number of conditions were introduced on organizations applying for the tax reduction including: the
requirement for major enterprises to introduce an energy management system; for small- and medium-sized
enterprises to use energy audits; and for the manufacturing sector as a whole to increase its energy efficiency by
1.3% in 2013-2015 and 1.35% in 2016.

Aggregates levy and landfill tax on construction and demolition waste. An aggregate levy was introduced
in 2002 in the UK to compensate for environmental externalities, reduce demand for primary aggregates,
encourage more efficient use of aggregates and maximize the use of alternatives such as recycled construction,
demolition waste, and secondary materials. Together with the landfill tax, which had been introduced in 1996, it
seeks to address the adverse impacts of the use of aggregates over their whole lifecycle, thus addressing the
previous implicit subsidy of non-internalization of externalities.

Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) schemes. In Italy, PAYT schemes charge households based on the actual amount
of waste generated, thus encouraging them to take steps to reduce their waste and improve separation of the
waste generated. The introduction of these schemes in certain municipalities in Italy led to a significant increase
in the amount of selective waste collection (i.e. waste sorted by households at home).

Other instruments

This section describes some less used market instruments (e.g. debt-for-nature swaps) as well
as emerging mechanisms (e.g. green bonds, direct private investments and payments for
environmental services) that were successful in different countries.

Debt-for-nature swaps, also called “debt for environment swaps,? can be used to finance
green projects. They are defined as the cancellation of (part of) the external debt of a country
in exchange for the debtor’s government commitment to mobilize domestic resources towards
environmental projects (OECD, 2007). It has been used to finance conservation (“green?, e.g.
preservation of biodiversity) or environmental protection (“brown?, e.g. pollution abatement)
projects, or the development of environmentally related infrastructure. Box 5 illustrates
successful applications of these instruments.

                                Box 5. Examples of debt for nature swaps

Debt for nature swaps can generate significant resources. To date, the largest environmental swap involving
conversion of bilateral debt has been concluded in Poland. The Polish “EcoFund? was established in 1992,
following Poland’s debt relief agreement with the “Paris Club? of western creditor nations. Due to a timely
initiative by the Polish Government, this agreement included an option for creditor countries to make bilateral
agreements with Poland for the conversion of up to 10% of debt for environmental protection purposes.
Although other “debt-for-environment? swaps had been concluded elsewhere, EcoFund was the first
fully-fledged institution established in Central and Eastern Europe for the purposes of managing
debt-for-environment swap proceeds.

By 2010, the total contribution to EcoFund was approximately USD474 million, the highest value of
debt-for-nature swap funds to be managed by any single institution. The EcoFund provided grant support for

projects addressing trans-boundary air pollution (11 projects); pollution and eutrophication of the Baltic Sea (26
projects); climate change (74 projects); biological diversity (60projects); and waste management and the
reclamation of contaminated soil.

Other examples include the France-Madagascar debt swap, to finance conservation of the unique biodiversity in
Madagascar in 2008 (USD20 million8) and the 2002 US-Peru swap, with the goal of building long-term forest
conservation and sustainable forestry initiatives in Peru during the timeframe 2002-2018 (USD14 million9).

Green bonds. Financial markets – through the banking sector, capital markets and equity
markets – can play an innovative role in financing sustainable SCP. Among the existing
instruments, green bonds have increasingly been used to meet natural resource challenges and
opportunities. Issuers can be multilateral development banks (e.g. World Bank, IFC,
European Investment Bank, etc.), cities or states, utilities, other banks, and the private sector.
The market is particularly strong in the US (the largest green bond issuing country), China,
and EU countries, particularly Norway, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the UK
(European Commission, 2016a). Table 4 provides a few applications of these instruments.

contamination of groundwater with agricultural nitrates by compensating farmers for cutting
their nitrogen use – and, crucially, supporting them as they converted to more sustainable
agriculture practices. A variety of domestic water companies, hydroelectric power producers,
irrigated commercial farms, and other private sector water users are paying to conserve the
watersheds from which they obtain their water, either directly or by through agreements with
the national PES program (as in Costa Rica and Mexico). Some tourism operators in Kenya
and Tanzania are paying local populations to safeguard the migration corridors of wildlife that
comes into their nature reserves. Some incentives provided by EU agricultural policy could
also be considered a type of PES to stimulate sustainable agricultural production.

Private sector initiatives that promote a more sustainable use of natural resources have also
increased in the past decade, e.g. through direct investments in land acquisition, private-public
participation and more. For example, IKEA Group has started investing in its own forest
assets as part of a strategic goal to ensure a stable supply of sustainably produced forest
products and a defined financial return. To date, the company has purchased about 100,000
hectares of forest (in Romania, Bulgaria, and the Baltics), which provide part of their current
forest product supply, and plans to expand its forest ownership even more. In addition, IKEA
has invested more than USD2 billion in renewable energy generation and is producing more
than 70% of its total energy consumption (Ecosystem Marketplace, 2016).

3.4Possible Implications for Turkey
This chapter provided a brief overview of economic instruments to sustain SDG 12, and their
implementation in several OECD countries. As the examples cited above account for only a
small share of market-based instruments implemented, they are not necessarily representative
for the level of success in the OECD countries. The success of implementing a certain
mechanism depends on many factors (e.g. type of mechanism chosen, design, existence of
regulations, consumer behavior, etc.); there is no “one size fits all? recipe for the success of
such measures.

Bearing in mind these limitations, and drawing upon a review of market-based instruments
carried out by ECORYS (2011), the paragraphs below present some insights into how these
instruments can be effectively used by other countries, such as Turkey.

   Consider a broad range of market-based instruments. In most OECD countries, taxes
    – particularly on energy and transport – are the most commonly used instruments for
    environmental protection. However, Denmark and the Netherlands provide successful
    examples of applying taxes on a much broader range of environmental issues (e.g. on
    water, plastic, pesticides) and of using other market-based instruments (e.g.,
    container-deposit schemes, etc.) to protect the environment and increase government
    revenues. In addition, the success of new instruments (e.g. green bonds for using
    renewable energy, PES for increased water quality) provides good opportunities for
    replicating the use of such instruments in other countries (CBI, 2015).
   Include market-based instruments as part of a “full package.? Market-based
    instruments should work in tandem with legislative, institutional, and other instruments, to
    improve their effectiveness and chance of success. For example, the success in the
    Swedish pesticides sector points to the high importance of education and
    awareness-raising campaigns among farmers in achieving environmental gains, much
    more than the pesticides tax itself (Box 2).
   Carefully design the instrument to increase the chance of success. Designing an

                                                                                              35
instrument can be a complex task and should consider:
(i) Rates set at a level that stimulates change (e.g. taxes, trading permits,
      environmentally motivated subsidies, PES). If the rates are set too low, their
      impacts are limited, or nonexistent. They need to be tailored to the context, taking
      relative prices and incomes into account. For example, PES must at least cover the
      difference between the net returns that landholders would receive from the
      environmentally-beneficial land use compared to those of their most profitable
      alternative (environmentally damaging) land use (Pagiola et al., 2008); effluent
      charges should be set in accordance with the level of damage per unit discharged.
(ii) Regular review of the level of these instruments. The case study in Ireland showed
      that although plastic bag use decreased immediately after the introduction of plastic
      bag taxes, it later began to increase again. This illustrates that an instrument’s impact
      can erode over time. Regularly updating these measures can help reduce this erosion
      effects.
(iii)Consideration of a long-term perspective. For instruments expected to operate on a
      long-term basis, timeline considerations are important. For example, for PES, it is
      necessary to institute annual payments conditional on the adoption of sustainable
      practices (Wünder, et al., 2008).
(iv) Adoption of an effective system of monitoring and evaluation. It is essential to
      monitor and evaluate the impacts of the adopted instruments in order to ensure their
      success, and especially to draw attention to the bottlenecks that can be encountered
      throughout the implementation of these instruments.

 IV. Economic Instruments to Support SCP-related Activities in
                Turkey: A Situation Analysis
To promote sustainable development including SCP, Turkey has adopted a range of economic or
market-based instruments such as taxes, charges, feed-in tariffs, subsidies, as well as regulatory
instruments like standards, limits, prohibition, permits, and licenses. These aim to or have effect to
enforce, finance or incentivize SCP practices. This chapter presents an overview of policies and
measures by the government as well as practices by Turkey’s private sector which
would encourage SCP, thus facilitating the fulfilment of SDG 12. These consist of actions
aimed at promoting resource and energy efficiency as well as the reduction of waste and
pollution by making such practices financially more attractive than their alternatives.
Due to the study’s time and resource limitations, this chapter mainly focuses on reviews,
including a literature review of economic instruments, particularly economic instruments and
their applications to supporting SCP in Turkey. The review starts with an overview of the
economic instruments for promoting SCP, then documents policy instruments and measures
introduced by relevant national development plans and programs.

4.1 An Overview of Economic Instruments for Supporting SCP in Turkey
Economy-wide policies, particularly macroeconomic stability and confidence in the
institutional framework, exert an important influence over investment decisions and support
sustainability in general as they allow investors to take a long-term view. Specific economic
instruments contribute to SCP by making economically preferable practices (from an SCP
point of view) more attractive than their alternatives. While some economic instruments
generate additional savings which may be invested in areas supportive of SCP, others may not
raise additional funds but redirect existing funds to such areas through economic
inducements. Naturally, some instruments work through both channels. This section reviews
such instruments as used in Turkey. They are comprised of policies and measures
implemented directly by the state, such as taxes and subsidies, as well as inducements such as
preferential credits provided through the market for SCP supportive actions by the private
sector. The direct actions of the State, such as through procurement policies or operational
innovations, have not been included. As an example in this regard, the government claims to
save 117,000 trees yearly through the use of electronic tax returns.10 Municipalities also have
numerous projects focused on sustainability. The Nilüfer municipality, for example, has
embarked upon a carbon-free village project providing an example of a municipality’s work at
the village level to help the fight against climate change.11
Taxes and Charges
In Turkey, the only tax based on environmental considerations appears to be the
Environment Cleaning Tax. However, the tax is not based on the waste generated but
rather on the amount of water used in households. As there is no benefit from producing
less waste, taxpayers feel little incentive to be clean. The Fuel Consumption Tax, Motor
Vehicles Tax, and Vehicle Purchase Tax could also be considered environment-related
taxes if they had been designed with such an aim, but instead their principal purpose
seems to be revenue generation. For the fuel consumption tax, success in fiscal terms

                                                                                                   37
may mean harm regarding sustainability. Higher taxes for cars with larger engines have
the dual purpose of generating more revenue and providing an incentive for fuel
economy. However, lower taxes are paid on older cars which usually have poor fuel
economy and pollute more. Turkey also introduced a tax waiver arrangement to
encourage phasing out old vehicles. When vehicles 20 years or older are taken out of use
and de-registered, any surcharge on their old unpaid taxes and fines is waived. A tax
system for cars based on their CO2 emissions would help the environment, but hurt the
poorer segments of the society who own older cars.
A scenario analyses of a potential carbon tax indicate that it would generate
considerable revenues, have divergent impacts on different sectors, influence the
electricity generation mix and affect import dependence (Baybek 2016a, 2016b 2016c;
Yeldan and Voyvoda 2015). Revenue recycling and a revenue-neutral tax design can
offset negative effects such as unemployment in some sectors, and thus help increase its
political acceptability. Sweden, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway and the
UK have experimented with fiscally neutral environmental tax reforms (World Bank,
2015). In Turkey, electricity generation merits priority attention as large increases in
emissions are expected from this sector in the near future. A considerable amount of
greenhouse gas mitigation is possible by switching from domestic lignite to less carbon
intensive fuels, but this can exacerbate import dependency by promoting imported coal
and natural gas.
Charges are important economic measures aimed at rationalizing the use of resources.
Water pricing in the agriculture sector is, perhaps, the most critical issue in terms of
increasing water efficiency. The current scheme with little concern for measuring the actual
volume of water use does not consider social and environmental externalities and
consequently the water price for irrigation does not reflect the full cost water (OECD, 2010).
With respect to domestic and industrial water pricing, different practices exist across the
country. Each municipality determines water tariffs based on subscriber type and the volume
consumed. In some cities like İstanbul, İzmir, Gaziantep and Bursa, municipalities apply
increasing block tariffs (graduated pricing) to charge differently for different groups of
subscribers and to ensure water saving through this price differentiation (Muslu, A., 2015).
Turkey’s EU candidacy brings a new dimension to the water pricing issue with key economic
principles like polluter pays and cost-effectiveness introduced by the EU Water Framework
Directive. Since the opening of the Environment Chapter of the negotiations in 2009, Turkey
has made progress towards compliance with relevant EU Directives by developing
regulations, standards, action plans as well as modifications in institutional arrangements. The
country has been putting efforts on incorporating economic incentives into water resources
management which will pave the way for moving its pricing mechanisms for both agriculture
and domestic/industrial water use toward full cost recovery and polluter pays principles.

One of the issues to keep in mind with the application of these instruments is that in
oligopolistic industries the cost of the charge may be passed to the weakest element of the
processing chain in terms of market power, thus reducing the charge’s effectiveness on the
environmental objective sought. In Malaysia, it was observed that around 50 per cent of the
cost generated by an affluent charge in the palm oil industry was passed on to the farmers.
Nevertheless, the adverse impact on the incomes of processors and especially farmers has
been mitigated through the use of the by-products/wastes from mills as fertilizers, animal
feed, biogas, etc. This provided additional income to processors and a sort of a subsidy to
farmers as by-product fertilizers were sold to them at a cheaper price (UNCTAD 1995).


                                                                                             38
Naturally, charges are useful instruments for modifying many aspects of lifestyles following
SCP principles. For example, traffic bottlenecks, which generate considerable waste and
misery, can be managed by congestion charges and other economic measures aimed at
increasing the costs of driving in cities. Although these are not used in Turkey, an
investigation into the applicability of a congestion pricing scheme in the Eminönü District of
Istanbul concluded that such an application could decrease road traffic by 15-40% and
increase the mean traffic speed by approximately 15-25 km/h (Yüksel et. al. 2010).

The whole fiscal policy and public finances of Turkey can be reviewed in terms of their
general impact on equity and economic efficiency, and their specific impact on SCP.
Although, for example, the draft income tax law of 2013, which further became the basis of
the current revision, starts its preamble by referring to sustainable development, the contents
of the Law do not have much to offer in this respect. There is room for introducing SCP
supportive elements to the income tax system, for example favourably accounting for SCP
related expenses in tax deductions. For this to be done effectively, in fact for any reform of
the tax system towards environmental priorities and SCP, the tax authorities and the
environmental experts need to work hand in hand, and some tax authorities should be better
aware of environmental impacts of fiscal measures.

Subsidies and Support

In Turkey, the top three sectors around which government subsidies and incentives are
centered are energy efficiency, renewable energy and agriculture. Subsidies can have
harmful or beneficial impacts on sustainable consumption and production. They may work
through investment decisions, input mixes or consumption choices. Some subsidies can be
considered as measures to correct market failures, for example those promoting the utilization
of energy efficient appliances. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the principal targets
of subsidies to help adopt sustainable practices. The Small and Medium Sized Industry
Development Organization (KOSGEB) supplies information regarding the subsidies and
support provided to SMEs, which include payment for services obtained from officially
authorized energy efficiency consultancy firms. Many SMEs, however, are unable to fully
benefit from the available support due to their ignorance and lack of experience.

On energy efficiency, the GoT, through the DG of Renewable Energy, is promoting energy
efficiency in the industry through two specific support programs: 1) Support of Efficiency
Improvement Projects, 2) Support of Voluntary Agreements. While both programs have
positive impacts, there is also a need to strengthen the implementation and monitoring
frameworks of these programs to scale-up investments in the SMEs. Furthermore, additional
analytical studies should be conducted in order to analyze existing and emerging market and
capacity barriers as well as the political and regulatory gaps in the field of energy efficiency.
Technical skills to apply energy saving methodologies also need to be developed for these
programs to succeed fully. Box 6 presents these programs’ details and the other examples of
support programs in the field of energy efficiency.

                Box 6. Examples of energy efficiency support programs in Turkey

Support of Efficiency Improvement Projects: Businesses engaged in the production of goods where
electricity consumption exceeds 1000 TOE, except the ones engaging in electricity generation, and all
kind of businesses engaged in the production of goods are eligible to receive this grant. The maximum
amount granted to each project is 1 million TL, of which the payback period should be less than 2 years.

Support of Voluntary Agreements: Companies that commit to reducing their energy intensity by a
minimum average of 10% over three years can enter into an agreement with DG of Renewable Energy and
20% of the company’s energy cost will be covered up to a limit of 200,000 TL. Source: www.eie.gov.tr

KOSGEB Energy Efficiency Support Programme for SMEs: Includes support activities like energy audit
services, consultations for energy efficiency improvement projects and energy manager training programs that
SMEs get from authorized energy efficiency companies; 50%-60% of the cost of these services is covered by
KOSGEB as long as the maximum limits are not exceeded. Source: www.kosgeb.gov.tr.


GoT is also taking important steps to promote energy efficient products, particularly in
home appliances, equipment and lighting. For example, energy standards and labelling
programs for household appliances have been operating in Turkey since 2010. Further,
Turkey transposed the EU Regulation on Eco-design for Energy-related Products and
Regulations on the Indication of Labelling and Standard Product Information of the
Consumption of Energy and Other Resources by Products in 2010 and 2011 respectively. Ten
product-related energy labels and 16 eco-design communiqués for implementation were
adopted through these regulations.
As for renewable energy, starting in 2005 with the enactment of the Law on Utilization
of Renewable Energy Resources, significant progress has been achieved in renewable
energy, with the government’s provision of financial incentives in some production
sectors. For example, the Law introduces feed-in tariffs (FiTs) for electricity generated
from renewable sources for ten years. With the amendment made to this Law in 2010, a
differentiated FiTs scheme based on resource type (for hydro & wind 7.3 US cents/KWh, for
geothermal 10.5 US cents/KWh, for biomass, solar PV and concentrated solar power 13.3 US
cents/KWh) and premiums for local equipment (Domestic Manufacturing Bonus) were made
available for investors. In addition to this, the Ministry of Economy offers further incentives
for renewable energy investments within the General Investment Incentive Scheme, which
allows investors to be exempted from VAT and custom duty (Acar, Kitson, and Bridle,
2015). In addition to this, Renewable Energy Resources Support Mechanism (YEKDEM) has
been regulated to encourage investments in renewable energy. Within the frame of the support
mechanism, retail companies assigned by the Energy Market Regulation Authority (EMRA)
are required to purchase the produced electricity from manufacturers who are subject to this
mechanism on tariffs regulated by the legislation; the electricity manufacturer cannot sell any
produced electricity to other companies under the open market conditions. YEKDEM consists
of feed-in tariffs (valid until 2020) for electricity manufacturing license holders and
unlicensed electricity manufacturers producing electricity from renewables and other
opportunities for renewable energy. 12 . Also, DG of Renewable Energy has recently
announced the “Draft Regulation on Renewable Energy Resource Areas? known as YEKA
with an aim to identify the feasible areas for the wind and solar power generation. The Draft
Regulation provides the rules and procedures on the determination of potential YEKAs;
feasibility and infrastructure studies with respect to YEKAs; publication of YEKAs;
pre-requisites and procedures for applicants wishing to invest in these YEKAs; competition
procedures where multiple applications exist for a YEKA and the requirements that the
investors should comply with during the preliminary license as well as the license generation
stages. Renewable energy based power plants on the YEKAs can benefit from all incentives
provided for the renewable energy based power plants. However, recent amendments made in
Electricity Market Law provide additional incentives for the power plants to be constructed in
YEKAs (Ergün et all, 2016).

Despite its huge potential in renewables (highest for geothermal in Europe and one of the
highest for wind and solar photovoltaic) and the existing support mechanisms provided by the
GoT, the share of renewables in Turkey’s total electricity generation still remains lower than
the potential and the need. The YEKA tender concluded on August 3, 2017 is a significant
development in this regard. With plants to be established in 5 regions of Turkey, an average
of 1.5 million tons of carbon emissions is expected to be avoided annually.13 In order to
push this further, barriers and challenges in relation to incentive mechanisms including any
informational challenges in economic and technical terms should be assessed and necessary
policy responses should be developed for the utilization of renewable resources. According
to TUSIAD, it is critically important for the emergence of a predictable investment
environment that the subsidies system and other regulations be sustained over the long term.

There is a significant dominance of hydroelectricity generation among the renewables in
Turkey. In 2015, hydropower had a 25.6% share of Turkey’s total electricity generation while
the non-hydraulic resources accounted only for 6.5% (TurkStat,2015). Hydropower
development in Turkey has been accompanied by considerable negative environmental
impacts and has caused irreversible loss of high value natural areas and freshwater
ecosystems. In order to minimize these negative environmental impacts, more efforts need to
be made to improve the investment environment, including regulatory framework, for
renewable energy and diversify the energy supply mix in an environmentally sustainable way.

Turkey has favourable practical experience in implementing financial instruments for the
sustainable use of natural resources, particularly in the agriculture sector. Main types of
financial instruments are government incentives, subsidies, soft credits and grants provided by
relevant Ministries, banks and agricultural cooperatives. Two programs are remarkable in
terms of putting environmental sustainability concerns into practice in the agriculture sector.
First, ÇATAK (Environmentally Based Agricultural Land Protection Scheme) is specifically
designed for environmental purposes in agriculture. The aim of the scheme is to reduce the
adverse effects of agricultural practices on the environment, to prevent erosion, to sustain
renewable natural resources, to protect the natural cover and quality of soil and water in
vulnerable areas. And second, the recently announced “National Agricultural Model,? a new
basin-scale support model, aims to plan and increase production while protecting natural
resources and implementing an efficient and rational agricultural support policy based on
agricultural basins. 941 micro catchments and 19 crops were identified, and support payments
in those areas will be differentiated according to climate, topography, water availability and
soil conditions. With the new model, transformation of the current support system to land
based support represents an important political change (MoFAL, 2016). Furthermore, the GoT
is planning to review allowances allocated for agricultural support with the objectives of
increasing efficiency, and value-added and necessary regulations will be introduced. (MoD,
2017). Finally, with the highest share of water use in Turkey being in agriculture, increasing
irrigation efficiency is a priority for the Turkish Government. Subsidies and interest free
credits to farmers for water-saving irrigation technologies are available through the Ministry
of Agriculture and state-owned Ziraat Bank. Simple changes in planting techniques my lead
to important environmental gains. For example in Brazil, changing from perpendicular to
contour planting systems on steep slopes for coffee and cocoa, and planting grass between
trees, reduced soil losses significantly. This technique was subsequently made a requirement
for receiving credit (May 1993). Water pricing was shown to have an important impact on the
amount of water used (and wasted) for washing coffee (Segura, B.O., Reynolds J. 1993).

An important aspect of SCP in agriculture and food, including for participation in global
markets, is compatibility with “good agricultural practices.? Although such voluntary
standards vary between different countries and different private operators, universality is
provided by GLOBALGAP (UNCTAD 2007). Turkey implements “iyi tarım? (good
agriculture?) principles in accordance with GLOBALGAP and in 2008, Good Agricultural
Practices were included within the scope of supports provided for plant production. As a
result of these government supports, the number of farmers applying good agricultural
practices has increased dramatically from 651 farmers in 2007 to 55,609 farmers in 2016
(MoFAL, 2017). Assistance, particularly to small producers, for better understanding the
standards and applying the necessary practices for compatibility with the official requirements
and other sophisticated private market exigencies would help SDG 12 from both the
production and consumption sides. The same observations hold for organic production as
well. This covers not only food but also other agricultural products such as fibres and
processed items. Reliability of certification is of critical importance.

National or regional action plans for organic food and farming have been developed in most
EU member states and various developing countries. They normally include targets for
adoption and a combination of specific measures, including direct income support through the
agro-environment/rural development programs; marketing and processing support;
certification support; producer information initiatives (research, training and advice);
consumer education; and infrastructure support. The main market incentive comes from
higher prices for organic products, with demand being mostly spurred by health concerns. An
important means of promoting organic production is to eliminate existing disincentives for
organics, such as distorting subsidies for chemical fertilizers. Regulations in importing
countries are increasingly demanding that organic products be produced with organic seeds,
but their availability in the formal market is not assured (UNCTAD 2007a). “Traditional?
seeds, which are more readily available, do not generally qualify for organic certification.

Besides organic, various types of labelling, including sustainable production from forests and
fisheries are also relevant for achieving SDG 12 in the country and improving opportunities
for participation in global value chains. Regarding food, SDG 12 emphasizes the reduction of
food waste. A study on the waste of bread (Oral 2015) revealed it to be caused principally by
ignorance: production beyond what will be sold, purchases beyond needs, unsuitable
conditions where bread is stored and ignorance about uses for stale bread. Nevertheless,
assisted by an awareness-building campaign, Turkey reduced its bread waste by 18 per cent in
2013.14 The Turkish Foundation to End Waste campaigns for the reduction of all kinds of
wasteful practices, from bread and water to electricity.

Unlike agriculture and energy sectors, government incentives for cleaner production,
eco-efficiency and waste reduction are quite limited and not even comparable to those in the
EU, in terms of variety and amount (MoEF-TTGV, 2010). Although there are some steps
taken towards promoting cleaner production, past and ongoing efforts are mostly project
based and because of this Turkey is still lacking effective financial instruments developed for
cleaner production, eco-efficiency and closing material loops. The Eco-Efficiency (Cleaner
Production) Programme developed by the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) in cooperation with the Technology Development Foundation of
Turkey (TTGV) and the Ministry of Industry in 2008, is an important step towards
transforming Turkish industrial enterprises into a more climate-friendly system with the use

of cleaner production and eco-efficiency applications. One of the Program’s outcomes was the
establishment of the National Eco-Efficiency (Cleaner Production) Centre for Turkey, which
is currently being run by TTGV15. In addition to this, TTGV also supports the R&D and
commercialization phases of product and/or process development practices carried out in four
priority areas—agriculture, education, healthcare and environment—in an integrated way
under its Support for Advanced Technology Projects Program. Within the scope of the
program, projects on products and processes that can improve resource/energy efficiency,
technologies related to renewable energy, technologies intended for smart energy distribution,
technologies for adaptation to climate change, identification and prevention of natural
disasters, recycling and utilization of wastes and other environmental technologies are eligible
for TTGV support in upper and lower limits of $3 million and $250,000 respectively.
Industrial corporations and software companies can benefit from the Program in which 50%
of the support is provided by TTGV16.

General support to Turkey’s tourism sector includes tax reductions, access to special
funds, permission to employ foreigners and land allocations. Incentives are higher to
rural tourism. There is no accreditation for eco-tourism, but a “green star? label to
climate-conscious operations is accorded by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The
Ministry of Culture and Tourism, UNDP and a private company ran a joint program
(from 2013-2015) to support small-scale sustainable tourism operations. Various villages
have recently declared themselves as “ecological villages,? sometimes with the assistance
of civil society organizations, hoping the designation will attract visitors. There is a lack
of guidelines as well as impact analyses, which also leads to informational challenges
regarding the generation of interest in such schemes both by potential localities and
funding sources.

Particularly relevant to SDG 12 are various types of “alternative tourism? such as
eco-tourism and rural tourism, the latter of which figures among the priorities of Turkey’s
Tourism Strategic Action Plan 2023. In spite of its great potential, alternative tourism is not
yet sufficiently professional and widespread. Regional Development Agencies provide limited
financial support to various operations relevant to SDG 12, including alternative tourism.
Official standards and accreditation, however, which would work through the market, and
could generate higher demand and revenues for the operators, are also called for. It is
noteworthy that although there is no accreditation for eco-tourism, a “green star? (Yeşil
Yıldız) label is accorded to climate conscious operations by the Ministry of Culture and
Tourism, enabling these enterprises to obtain electricity at favorable rates. Examples
obtainable from the various blogs of the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, for example
regarding Thailand’s experience, could provide ideas for implementing market-based
instruments for sustainable tourism in Turkey. Italy’s experience with the Cinque Terra Card,
which provides access to many sites and transportation, and whose revenues are used to
protect traıls, marine and national parks, is another example.17

There are no speci?c educational or support programs dedicated to green
entrepreneurship which could act as an enticement to potential beneficiaries. This also
limits the interest and demand for such programs. Endeavor Entrepreneurship is a
network for entrepreneurs, with an emphasis on sustainable development, providing
mentoring services to promising entrepreneurs fulfilling the network’s requirements.

On the negative side, subsidies in Turkey, particularly those given to coal production are
found to be the most important barrier for reducing carbon emissions. Moreover, higher
investment support is offered for coal and petroleum than for power stations using
green fuels. There are a multitude of subsidies used in the fuels sector. Unlike other
fuels, coal is currently not subject to special consumption taxes, and yearly coal
consumption subsidies have been estimated at 730 million USD (Acar, Kitson, and
Bridle, 2015). Box 7 summarizes the existing incentives to Turkey’s coal industry in
more detail. Removal of coal subsidies may negatively impact the employment in coal
mining areas. This could require some compensation, and policy makers are reluctant to
implement any measure that would seem to increase costs and impede competitiveness.
High transaction costs due to the typically small size of renewable energy projects
compared with large fossil-fuel-based projects also act as a disincentive to investment in
the renewable energy sector.

Another financial instrument for forcing firms to repair inevitable harm during certain
production processes such as mining is performance bonds, where bonds are posted by
industries to finance clean up or rehabilitation expenditures, with refunds for improved
efficiency. These have been particularly helpful in South Africa in financing mine closure
expenditures in the coal mining industry (Raimondo in UNCTAD and UNEP 1999). They
have also been used in Costa Rica and Sarawak in Malaysia (World Bank 2005) and in
Thailand (Seenprachawong 2001), and proposed for gold mining in Turkey (Arda 1995).

                                       Box 7. Coal subsidies in Turkey

The three main challenges Turkey faces in its electricity market are meeting the growing demand for
electricity, improving energy security, and ensuring that electricity prices remain affordable. To overcome
these challenges, GoT aims to increase the supply of electricity through a considerable investment in
coal-fired generation (Acar, Kitson, and Bridle, 2015). Utilization of all possible domestic resources in
energy production is deemed a priority for the GoT, including not only renewables but also all domestic
lignite and hard coal. The Strategic Plan 2015-2019 of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources attaches
great importance to the coal sector with the objective of increasing the use of domestic coal to 60 billion kWh
by 2019, which was 32.9 billion kWh in 2013 for electricity generation (MoENR, 2014). The Domestic
Resource Based Energy Production Programme of the 10 th Development Plan reiterates this same objective.
In addition to the 25 coal-fired power plants in use and three new ones under construction, more than 70 new
coal-fired power plants are in the pipeline (in planning, licensing/pre-licensing, EIA stage or officially
announced but not documented). If all of these projects are realized, the emissions from these new plants are
estimated to consist of about 400 million tons of GHG annually, which is almost as hig h as Turkey’s current
total annual emissions (IPC, 2016).

With the aim of supporting continued development of indigenous reserves in Turkey, a large part of coal
subsidies are directed to production. The GoT provides a considerable amount of incentives to both the lignite
and hard coal mining industries. In addition to the production subsidies, the government offers various
investment incentives for coal-fired power plants including investment guarantees to coal power plants for up
to 15-20 years of their life operation; guaranteed prices; the purchase of electricity for certain periods of time
offered to lignite-fired power generation investments; and rehabilitation support for hard coal mines and coal
power stations. More importantly, coal-fired power plants are considered “priority investments? within the
New Investment Incentive System introduced in 2012, and as a part of this new system coal exploration,
production and investments are receiving elevated incentives. Under the General Investment Incentive Plan,
which is a component of the New Investment Incentive Scheme, all electricity generating facilities using
domestic coal are entitled to VAT and customs duty exemption (IEA, 2016). It is important to note that these
incentives are complemented by exemptions from environmental regulations. To put it in another way,
Turkey’s coal industry also benefits from the underpricing of externalities in relation to health and

                                                                                                                     44
environmental damages. In addition to these producer subsidies, there are also consumer subsidies for coal.
The Ministry of Family and Social Policies has been distributing coal to poor families, accounting for over 2
million households since 2003, with a minimum amount of 500 kilograms of coal per household. When all
measurable coal incentives in Turkey are taken into account, the amount of incentive per kWh is calculated as
approximately 0.02 USD including coal distribution to poor families ( Acar, Kitson, and Bridle, 2015).


Credits
Apart from direct action and investments by the government, the banking system in
Turkey provides credits financing SCP related activities. Even banks that do not adhere
to international initiatives such as the Global Compact take part in directing funds to
SCP activities. While these funds are generally used for energy related activities, they
could also help in overcoming some more general market failures such as shortage of
long term credits. Capital and equity markets or venture funds and institutional
investors, however, are not yet particularly in favor of SCP related investments in
Turkey.
Among the plethora of financing instruments, credits on favourable terms are widely
used as a means of green financing in Turkey. The favourable terms include not only
low rates but also exemptions from certain taxes and long repayment periods.

Some of these credits fall under large programs such as the Turkish Mid-size
Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MidSEFF) and the Turkish Sustainable Energy
Financing Facility (TurSEFF). MidSEFF, launched by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) with the support from the European Investment
Bank (EIB) and EU, provides a total of EUR one billion in loans through seven Turkish banks
(Akbank, Denizbank, Finansbank, Garanti, Isbank, Vakifbank, Yapikredi) for on-lending to
private sector borrowers, for financing mid-size investments in renewable energy,
waste-to-energy and industrial energy efficiency. Likewise, TurSEFF, developed by EBRD, is
a credit line designed for industrial and commercial SMEs to be used on their energy
efficiency and renewable energy investments. Clean Technology Fund (CTF) also provided
concessional funding to the TurSEFF program. In 2009, Turkey was among the first countries
to receive CTF resources and the government of Turkey has worked closely with the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), members of the World Bank
Group (IBRD, IFC), and key Turkish stakeholders, to design an investment plan that taps
US$250 million from the CTF for a range of innovative, high-impact energy sector projects.
More details on the CTF Investment Plan for Turkey is presented in Box 8.
        Box 8. Shaping clean energy in Turkey through the Clean Technology Fund (CTF)

The Clean Technology Fund (CTF) Investment Plan for Turkey is the cornerstone of Turkey’s investment
strategy for climate change and sustainable development. The Plan makes major contributions to three critical
Government of Turkey development objectives: (1) Enhancing energy security – by improving energy efficiency
as well as generating energy from locally available renewable resources (2) Supporting a clean energy transition
– by focusing on meeting energy needs in an environmentally sustainable manner and thereby reducing
greenhouse gas emissions; and (3) Increasing private sector involvement – in the development and financing of
clean energy and energy efficiency investments – with credit intermediated through Turkish banks (CIF, 2012).

The implementation of Phase I of the CTF Investment Plan has been highly successful in Turkey. Fifteen
projects/programs are being implemented with CTF support in the field of geothermal development, residential
energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy efficiency with a total funding of US$449 million.
(www.climateinvestmentfunds.org)

Among the programs and projects co-funded by CTF, four are remarkable in terms of their scope, outcomes and
partnership models: The Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Project, Renewable Energy

                                                                                                                45
Integration Project (REIP), Renewable Energy Integration Technical Assistance Project (REITAP) and Turkey
Private Sector Sustainable Energy Finance Facility (TurSEFF).

The Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Project , implemented by the World Bank,
accomplished its objectives of accelerating the development of small hydro and wind powered plants, and
pioneering large industrial-scale energy efficiency. Sub-loans through the Industrial Development Bank of
Turkey (TSKB) and Development Bank of Turkey (TKB) pioneered transactions in small hydro, wind energy
generation and energy efficiency investments in large industrial manufacturing. Overall, the US$100 million in
CTF financing leveraged US$1.53 billion, and TKB and TSKB were able to attract an additional US$1 billion
for renewable energy and energy efficiency from other international financiers. The project has financed 52
renewable energy projects with substantial new RE capacities of about 944MW and 30 large-scale demand side
energy-efficiency projects which are estimated to have contributed to a reduction in GHG emissions of 3 million
tons per year, 150% of the original target.

Renewable Energy Integration Project (REIP), implemented by the World Bank, aims to assist Turkey in
meeting its increased power demand by integrating large scale renewable energy generation to the grid and
strengthening the transmission system. Further, the global environmental objective is to lower greenhouse gas
emissions from fossil fuel-based power through greater integration of renewable energy generation in Turkey.
The project is developing transmission infrastructure to support wind power plants, smart-grid investments to
improve operation and management, and install submarine power cables to interconnect wind energy locations
with other parts of Turkey. 12 out of 19 large contracts are being implemented under the project, and others are
at tendering stage. They, as a whole, are expected to provide nearly 300 million tonnes reductions in CO2
emissions till 2030.

Renewable Energy Integration Technical Assistance Project (REITAP), implemented by the World Bank,
aims to enhance capacity for generation planning, transmission planning, and grid management in Turkey in
anticipation of increased share of renewable energy in the generation mix.

Turkey Private Sector Sustainable Energy Finance Facility (TurSEFF) Provides funds to industrial and
commercial small- and medium-sized enterprises to be used for their energy efficiency and renewable energy
investments. Credit lines are provided to eligible commercial banks by EBRD for on-lending to private sector
borrowers for energy efficiency and small-scale renewable energy investments. The program’s participating
banks are Denizbank, İş Bankası, Vakıfbank and Yapı Kredi. TurSEFF has been active since 2010 and 874
investment projects have been financed since the program began; they are expected to provide up to 1982 ktons
reductions in CO2 emissions annually. TurSEFF also has a comprehensive technical assistance package.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) and French Development Agency (AFD)
also cooperate with Turkish banks to provide credits at favourable conditions,
particularly for energy efficiency and, in the case of IFC, for green construction through
green mortgage credits. Some banks advertise green loans that go beyond their
MidSEFF and TurSEFF agreements. These include favourable loans for energy efficient
houses, environment-friendly cars, waste management, sustainable tourism and organic
agriculture. The voluntary Sustainability Guidelines for the banking sector spearheaded by
the Banks Association of Turkey and prepared by a working group on the Role of the
Financial Sector in Sustainable Growth, is being applied by some banks which have
established sustainability departments and reported on their sustainability results. Embedding
sustainable banking principles in the sector will be crucial for dealing responsibly with large
infrastructure and PPP projects relevant to SCP.
Apart from access to subsidized credits, green bonds were floated in 2016 to obtain
funds on favourable terms. The construction and operation of a new hospital in Elazığ,
was financed by a certified "green and social bond." A 20-year Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) guarantee, along with a liquidity facility
provided by the EBRD, has led Moody's to assign an investment grade rating of Baa2 to
the bond, surpassing Turkey's sovereign rating at the time. In May 2016 TSKB Turkey’s

                                                                                                             46
first privately-owned development and investment bank, became one of the first emerging
market institutions to issue a green/sustainable bond, the demand for which was more
than thirteen times the amount offered. This offer won the Socially Responsible
Investing (SRI) Bond award (EMEA Green/SRI Bond Deal of the Year) for 2016 from
International Financing Review. This was followed in March 2017 by the issuance of
US$300m in subordinated tier 2 sustainable notes. Projects to be targeted by TSKB span
across sectors such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, healthcare, education, ports, and
electricity transmission. This performance has not been replicated by others, including large
state owned banks. Lack of trained personnel in sustainability issues may have been a reason
for this aversion.
Carbon markets
Turkey has played a prominent role in the global voluntary carbon market. It is the
largest seller of voluntary carbon credits in Europe. Transactions during the period
2007 – 2015, were around 35 million tons of CO2 valued at over US$ 200 million. This is
equivalent to approximately 70 per cent of the total market volume in Europe to date. In
2015, Turkey was responsible for around half of all primary transactions in Europe,
amounting to 3.1 million tons of CO2. This made Turkey the fourth largest supplier of
voluntary carbon offsets globally after the United States, India and Indonesia. Despite
high transaction volumes, however, the total value of these transactions declined from
US$ 18.6 million in 2013 to US$ 4.3 million in 2015 due to a decline in the price of
voluntary carbon offsets. The majority of Turkey’s voluntary carbon transactions were
derived from sales of Verified Emission Reductions (VERs) generated by wind, hydro,
and landfill methane projects. As of April 2016, Turkey had 235 registered projects.

In 2014, Chile became the first South American country to pass carbon tax legislation,
targeting emissions from the nation’s large thermal power plants, which contribute
about 55 percent of the country’s total GHG emissions. On January 1, 2015, South
Korea’s cap-and-trade program went into effect, officially joining the European
emissions-trading system and Chinese pilot emissions-trading programs as one of the
largest carbon markets in the world (WRI 2015). Preparations for the establishment of
the national carbon market have been underway in Turkey for several years. EBRD’s
Carbon Market Development Support Programme assists in the development of the
Turkish Carbon Market, promoting the participation of Turkish banks and companies
in carbon markets in Turkey and abroad. The Climate Stars program is designed to
support companies in different sectors towards carbon neutrality. MidSEFF support in
this context includes carbon asset development and monetization of the generated
carbon credits.
Turkey also joined the Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR) initiative in April 2011
which provides support to prepare and implement climate change mitigation policies,
including carbon pricing instruments, in order to scale up GHG mitigation to countries.
Turkey is one of the 19 implementing country participants within the global PMR
program. The PMR Turkey Project, coordinated by the Ministry of Environment and
Urbanization and supported by the World Bank, aims to pioneer activities on
implementation of legislation on monitoring, reporting and verification, and conducting
studies on applicability of carbon pricing instruments in Turkey, including potentially an
Emission Trading Scheme pilot in the coming years. More specifically, PMR Turkey was
set to analytically analyze the suitability and applicability of market-based emission reduction
policy instruments, such as emissions trading schemes, carbon tax in detail, in addition to

                                                                                             47
      white and green energy certificates, scaled-up crediting mechanism, result-based finance in
      Turkey (www.pmrturkey.org).
      The international business community is also seeing the value of a carbon tax. More than
      1,000 businesses joined 74 countries and 23 sub-national jurisdictions at the 2014 U.N.
      Climate Summit to vocalize support for putting a price on carbon, including powerhouses like
      Nestlé, Unilever and Nokia. They made clear that pricing carbon is not only good for the
      climate, but also good for business, as it is among the most efficient and cost-effective ways
      to reduce emissions (WRI 2015). The Turkish Industry and Business Association
      (TUSIAD) believes that the nascent carbon trading system should be implemented in
      conjunction with a neutral carbon tax where any additional burden is compensated by
      allowances in other areas and energy efficiency enhancing policies. It also emphasizes
      informational challenges and proposes implementation only after sufficient data on
      sectoral carbon emissions are available and firms gain sufficient experience in
      monitoring, reporting and verification. Apart from design issues requiring well trained
      personnel in related areas, according to TUSIAD, most important among deficiencies
      and threats that impede the development of the ETS in Turkey are the insufficient depth
      of Turkey’s financial markets and deficiencies in its auditing and monitoring systems
      (TUSİAD, 2016). There have been several studies on the legal aspects of carbon trading
      in Turkey, undertaken within a UNDP project Capacity Building for Climate Change
      Management in Turkey. Their conclusions include, for example, that activities around
      carbon certificates should be exempt from value added tax, whether transactions are
      carried out internationally or domestically, and that it is necessary for the
      administrative power needed for carbon markets to operate harmoniously and
      seamlessly (Korkusuz n.d.; Atar 2010).
      Traditionally, China has been better at using administrative measures instead of market-based
      measures to meet its carbon emissions reduction goals. But China launched its first pilot
      emission trading program this past June. This development is potentially a major marker in
      the country’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Shenzhen Emissions
      Trading Scheme (ETS) program will cover some 635 industrial companies from 26 industries.
      This is the first of seven proposed pilot GHG cap-and-trade schemes in China, which the
      country has been developing since 2011. Shenzhen has set up an ambitious target for its ETS
      compared to existing national or local commitments. The 635 companies will be given a
      roughly 100 million metric ton CO2 emission allowance for free over the next three years. If
      the companies emit only their allotted amount, this would be equal to a 32 percent reduction
      in terms of GDP emission intensity (WRI 2013).

      4.2 Review of the Policy Applications in Existing National Plans and
      Programs in Support of SCP
      The concept of environmental sustainability has a long history in Turkish development policy.
      Since the 5th National Development Plan of 1985-1989, the sustainable use and management
      of natural resources and some themes of SCP have been mainstreamed within the national
      policies. Unlike the previous ones, the current 10th NDP, covering the period of 2014-2018,
      has been prepared with a “sustainable development? focus. The Plan targets are defined under
      four main axes: 1) Qualified people, strong society; 2) Innovative production, high and stable
      growth; 3) Livable places, sustainable environment; 4) International cooperation for
      development. Objectives and policies in the context of increasing the social and economic
      benefits of environment-friendly approaches, enhancing the quality of urban and rural life in a
      sustainable way, reducing disparities between regions, land and water resources management,
      and protection of the environment are placed under “Livable Places, Sustainable
      Environment? section of the Plan. In addition, the 10th NDP is comprised of 25 Primary
      Transformation Programs (PTP) in line with the Plan objectives. The aim of these programs is
      to lessen primary structural problems, contribute to the transformation process and enable
      coordination among institutions (MoD, 2014).

      Although an evaluation of the 17 SDGs that places them in four groups according to their
      apparent priority for Turkey puts SDG12 among those with the lowest score, this does not
      mean that Turkey is successful with regards to this goal. This reflects the fact that until
      ensuring sustainable economic growth and improving the wellbeing of the society, human
      resources decision makers continue to consider “environment? as a “luxury good? for the
      development agenda (Bayazıt and Önsal 2017). Nevertheless, looking at SDG 12 and the
      relevant policies within the 10th NDP, it can be concluded that policy objectives are
      considerably consistent between Goal 12 and the Plan. The Plan has placed much emphasis

                                                                                                         50
on sustainable consumption and production patterns, and defines several targets to promote
environmentally friendly practices in production and services such as renewable energy,
eco-efficiency and cleaner production technologies. Further, the Plan underlines the need for
improving financial sources for environmental investments, using these sources efficiently
and supporting environmentally friendly methods and technologies. It is also aims to ensure
green growth by exploiting the potential of environmentally friendly approaches in terms of
new job opportunities, income sources, product and technology development in areas like
energy, industry, agriculture, transport, construction, services and urbanization. In addition to
these, PTPs for Reducing Import Dependency, Energy Efficiency, Domestic Resource Based
Energy Production, Enhancing Efficiency of Water Use in Agriculture, Rationalization of
Public Expenditures and Enhancing Productivity in Manufacturing have put forward several
policies related to key themes of SCP and set some actions for the development of new
financial mechanisms, particularly for the energy and agriculture sectors.

To a lesser extent, Turkey’s Medium Term Program (MTP) covering the period from
2017-2019, includes some objectives to support environmentally friendly practices in the
manufacturing industry and agriculture, that emphasize energy efficiency and underline the
importance of green growth (MoD, 2016b).

In the same way, several sector specific action plans and strategies highlight the importance
of developing financing tools for SCP, but lacking a proposal of concrete actions. For
example, the National Recycling Strategy and Action Plan mentions the desirability of
economic measures such as subsidies for investment in recycling plants and criticizes the fact
that there is no real requirement to use “environment cleaning? taxes for cleaning the
environment, however it does not specifically propose any economic measures. In addition,
the Industry Strategy Document repeatedly emphasizes respect for the environment and the
sustainable use of resources, identifies the related weaknesses and opportunities in a SWOT
analysis and specifies areas where training should be intensified, such as carbon trading, but
falls short of proposing any specific economic measures. Similarly, the National
Eco-Efficiency Programme for 2014-2017 prioritizes provision of financial instruments for
industrial enterprises as one of the main axes of the Program in which food manufacturing,
textiles, chemicals and chemical products, non-metallic mineral products, basic metals and
motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers are listed as a priority manufacturing sub-sector
based on their potential for eco-efficiency and cleaner production. However, the Program fails
to introduce concrete actions on any financial instruments. Likewise, both the SME Strategy
and Action Plan for 2015-2018, and the Productivity Strategy and Action Plan for 2015-2018,
put forward some activities with regard to the promotion of industrial symbiosis and closing
material loops without defining explicit economic measures.
Over the past decade, Turkey has been rethinking how its power is generated and consumed.
In spite of the current support provided to coal, combatting climate change through the
development of clean energy and increasing energy efficiency are considered to be strategic
benefits for Turkey, and efforts have been put towards developing economic measures to
reduce GHG emissions and increase energy efficiency. For instance, the National Climate
Change Action Plan (NCCAP) sets clear objectives for both the mitigation and adaptation
aspects of climate change, and includes some economic measures. The Cross Cutting Issues
Section of NCCAP refers to market based mechanisms as a means of achieving the purpose of
“Optimum usage of emission trading mechanisms that contribute to cost effective limitation
of greenhouse gas emissions,? (MoEU, 2012). Similarly, the Energy Efficiency Strategy
Paper (EESP) includes specific actions for the establishment of a carbon market mechanism
for the purpose of creating financing opportunities for GHG emission mitigation (MoENR,
                                                                                              51
2011). As another example, the İstanbul International Financial Center Strategy and Action
Plan aims to establish the carbon market and commence the trading of carbon and GHG
emissions. Finally, the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP), which is planned to
be adopted in July 2017, is an important roadmap for Turkey to support sustainable energy
development and to achieve the 2023 energy efficiency targets in the scope of the EU
Accession negotiations. The NEEAP also aims to overcome barriers in the regulatory
framework, and in the investment environment for energy and resource efficiency in Turkey.
Table 6 summarizes policies related to the promotion and financing of SCP within the main
plans, programs and strategies.

Activities by civil society organizations may play a significant complementary role which
contributes to achieving SCP objectives. Professional organizations can be important sources
of information on sustainability issues and policies, although they are mostly concerned with
topics specifically related to their occupational concerns. For example, although it is
concerned with technical matters, the website of a network of environmental engineers
occasionally covers topics related to economic policies and tools. 18 There are also
consultancy firms specialized in environmental issues 19 or more precisely on the support
provided by the state, and how to benefit from it.20

Petrol Sinai Derneği (PETDER) – society of petroleum industries has a sizeable part of its
annual report for 2015 allocated to the management of waste oils.21 Apart from providing
ideas, practical examples of SCP can be identified as social entrepreneurship. An interesting
project, entitled “çöpmadam? (waste lady) looks for new uses for waste materials and
addresses the issue of women’s unemployment as well as the importance of proper recycling
and re-using of waste.

A report on green entrepreneurship22 written with the technical support of Türkiye Teknoloji
Geliştirme Vakfı (Technology Development Foundation of Turkey) reviews the ecosystem for
developing green entrepreneurship and provides suggestions after analysing the situation in
several sectors – energy, waste management, agriculture and animal husbandry, housing,
electrical appliances, eco-tourism and environmental and energy consultancy. A support
network for entrepreneurs, with an emphasis on sustainable development, is Endeavor Etkin
Girişimci Destekleme Derneği, 23 which provides mentoring services to promising
entrepreneurs fulfilling the requirements of the network. Within the Turquality program 24
support is provided for expenses incurred for various objectives, including for adaptating to
environmental, quality, and health regulations.

There are some civil society organizations25 active on the subject of sustainable consumption,
working mostly on the provision of information including on consumer rights and

     V.     Areas for Improvement and Policy Recommendations
As discussed in last chapter, as Turkey makes progress in promoting sustainable development
and implementing MDGs and SDGs there are increasing policy applications for green
financing. Results after reviewing Turkey’s green financing practices, including what has
been included in national programs, do not show much divergence from the global trends
presented in Chapter 3. However, tangible policies and measures remain insufficient and
there is room for improvement. This chapter discusses areas for improvement and provides
recommendations for developing a national framework and instruments for SDGs,
particularly SDG 12.

5.1 Areas for Improvement
National framework

Before going to specific market-based instruments and their applications, there are, as
discussed in previous chapters, areas of concern in the national policy framework for
financing SCP in Turkey. Currently, no comprehensive framework or strategy has been
developed for financial mechanisms to promote SCP. Green financing is not yet clearly and
consistently defined and elaborated upon in existing national strategies, policies, and action
plans. Moreover, neither the plans nor the strategies provide clear insights on economic
incentives and financial tools to be developed for the successful implementation of SCP. They
also fall short on analyzing the shortcomings and impacts of available instruments and
defining new mechanisms. Consequently, it is not easy for investors, companies and banks to
identify opportunities for green financing. This is particularly true around applying policy
instruments to SCP. Therefore, it is necessary for Turkey to deepen its understanding of green
financing mechanisms, including the roles of the public and private sector, financial
intermediates, and instruments in this domain, adopt a policy framework and guidance and
effectively mobilize and use both public and private SCP funding by implementing various
economic instruments to incentivize stakeholders.

At the sectoral level, Turkey’s on-going sectoral policies often lack synergy and sometimes
contradict each other. One particular concern is a lack of coherence between different sectoral
strategies and policies pursuing SCP. An example is the existence of financial assistance
given to coal mining and favourable incentives provided for coal-fired power plants.
Similarly, some sector-specific regulations and financial incentives related to tourism and
mining may not be fully consistent with each other and so create adverse impacts on some
areas with high natural value and undermine Turkey’s efforts in promoting environmental
sustainability. The coherence between Turkey’s climate change policies and SCP deserves
special attention. To be more specific, sustainable consumption and production can play a role
in addressing climate change, and many climate change policies are, in fact, shaping
sustainable production and consumption policies. Therefore, to implement SDG12 effectively,
Turkey should seek synergy in adopting policies for SDG 12 and SDG 13 (climate actions).

Experience learning and public-private platforms


Turkey has been actively learning from other countries in sustainable development, especially


                                                                                            59
from the experience of EU and OECD countries. It also emphasizes private sector
participation in the consumption and production area. At the national level, good examples
exist of experience sharing and partnership through sustainable finance working groups or
multi-stakeholder platforms organized by different players such as the World Business
Council on Sustainable Development Turkey (known as SKD Turkey), Global Compact
Turkey and the Banks Association of Turkey (TBB) as well as the Sustainability Platform
chaired by Borsa İstanbul. However, the representation of working groups remains limited,
particularly from the banking sector (SKD Turkey, 2014). It is crucial to create a national
platform or coalition with the participation of high level government agencies and business
champions as well as players from different segments of the finance sector (banks, investors,
insurers) to discuss the existing barriers and gaps on green financing and to mobilize new
financing opportunities and mechanisms for ensuring SCP. Green financing mechanisms can
be further developed through PPP.

Monitoring and evaluation

Turkey has been one of the leading countries to implement MDGs and has been actively
developing its sustainable development indicators systems and environmental and natural
capital accounts. After the adoption of SDGs led by TurkStat, the country has formed working
groups including one dedicated to the monitoring of SDGs, and developed the 2017-2021
Statistical Program, which features SDG indicators and a road map. According to the initial
assessment of the work for SDGs indicators, quite a number of them lack available data or
facing missing or incomplete data. A lot of work remains to be done by TurkStat and/or line
ministries or agencies responsible for sectoral or thematic development issues in order to
improve the data availability and complete the SDG indicators.

Developing a set of green finance indicators, and improving data availability to monitor and
evaluate their impacts, are equally important. For instance, in a recent report prepared by the
G20 Green Finance Study Group (G20,2016), the G20 and country authorities highlighted the
need for promoting an initiative to work on green finance indicators and to consider the
economic and broader impacts of green finance for analysis. The Study also underlines the
need to create a link between green finance data, which is still very variable and often lacks
common metrics, and environmental data.

A key component of quality evaluation of SDG implementation in terms of its outcomes and
impacts is life-cycle analysis and the valuation of its full economic benefits and costs.
Environmental externalities of production and consumption activities, and economic values
and accounts of natural resources exploited and utilized, are rarely incorporated in the current
evaluation practices, and should be taken into account as much as possible.

Beyond the above issues, the next critical one is how to line up, prioritize and use different
economic instruments – taxes, fees, credits, subsidies, and other innovative financing means –
to finance sustainable development, particularly SCP. Despite some applications of these
instruments, improvement of the efficacy of existing applications and the adoption of new and
possibly more innovative instruments are necessary, and discussed below.

Turkey’s policies towards achieving sustainable production and consumption patterns should,
in principle, be aligned with those of the European Union as the country’s desire is to join the
EU. Thus, development of economic instruments prevalent in the EU should be on Turkey’s


                                                                                             60
agenda. Although Turkey has made efforts to have its environmental legislation, including the
regulations for environmental tariffs, fees, and charges, comply with the EU acquis, the
effectiveness of its application of these instruments and enforcement of current regulations
needs to be strengthened.

Taxes, charges and fees

As discussed previously, taxes and charges have a direct impact on production and
consumption decisions and tax revenues can contribute to green financing if they are
earmarked and used for that purpose. But this is seldom the case in Turkey. To design
environmental taxes, polluter or user pays principles should first be adopted in order to shift
the tax burden from “good? activities to “bad? ones such as emissions and provide the correct
incentives. However, unlike many EU member states, Turkey has not started to effectively
reform its taxes according to these principles, and little incentive is provided to producers
and/or consumers to reduce waste generation and discharge. For example, taxes on fuel,
despite contributing to improving efficiency to some extent, may not have efficiency as their
main purpose. Furthermore, the requisite scientific and institutional framework does not exist
for a more targeted use of efficiency as a goal in the fiscal system. EU and other international
experience could be useful for guiding Turkey in introducing environmental sustainability
concerns into the tax system and adopting effective policy instruments for SCP.

Environment-related taxes such as energy taxes and motor vehicle taxes are commonly used
in Turkey. As shown in Figure 5 of Chapter 3, their revenue, as a proportion of GDP, is
strikingly higher than all other countries. Although increasing these taxes is generally
proposed on the basis of environmental management, the high revenue implies that these
taxes in Turkey are revenue-oriented and would be less desirable on the grounds of equity and
efficacy. It can be argued that the use of revenues from such indirect taxes should be aligned
with SCP objectives or these taxes should be reduced in favour of direct taxation on
emissions.

Natural resource taxes, charges or prices in Turkey have room for improvement too. Water
tax and/or water pricing is a critical issue for Turkey, given its increasing population and
demand for water as well as water resources’ vulnerability to climate change. In addition, the
quality of surface and groundwater resources is becoming an important concern for Turkey as
many of its river systems are facing water pollution problems, particularly river basins located
in the western part of the country, due to intensive industrial activities, high urban population
and non-point pollution caused by agricultural production. It may not be easy, however, to
take far reaching actions owing to social and economic considerations (Bayazıt and Önsal
2017). Following the EU Water Framework Directive, Turkey needs to implement cost
recovery and polluter/user pays principles in pricing mechanisms to adopt an effective water
pricing or taxation system and set the right price in order to protect its water resources and improve the
efficiency of agricultural, industrial and domestic uses of water.

The same cost-recovery and polluter-pay principles should be applied to charges, pollution
levies, landfill tipping fees, and disposal charges of hazardous and other solid wastes. It is
important that the incidence of the cost caused by the charges falls upon the part of the
processing chain where the environmental harm that is sought to be mitigated is created.

As applied in many developed countries, these instruments should generate enough incentive



                                                                                                       61
for polluters to reduce pollution emissions and stop water bodies from becoming severely
polluted. Therefore, Turkey should strengthen the enforcement of these instruments and
install additional efforts to assess and improve the effectiveness of current effluent charges
with regards to incentivization, affordability, and cost recovery. For solid waste management,
pay as you throw schemes and volume-based fees or charges should be gradually introduced
in order to create an explicit incentive for waste recycling. Tradable waste permits and
modern waste management systems, as in the UK and other developed countries, should
gradually be introduced as the level of public awareness and participation increases.
Legislation regarding the use of recycled material should be reviewed in the light of EU
practices. In Turkey, the informal sector in waste collection and recycling needs to be
carefully taken into account.

Subsidies, credits and other forms of financial support

Subsidies, support schemes, and favorable credits have been used quite extensively in Turkey.
They may be a positive factor from an SCP perspective, for instance in promoting energy
efficiency and developing renewable energy, and thus function as a source of green financing,
or vice versa, generating effects harmful to SCP.

Subsidies, tax exemption, favourable credits and other support measures provided to activities
undesirable from a sustainability point of view will certainly create wrong incentives and
worsen market failures. One area where worldwide trends and the Turkish government’s
priorities clash strongly is in the use of coal, particularly low quality domestic coal, and the
associated economic policy instruments. About 80 per cent of Turkey’s energy is based on
imports, including nearly all of its oil and gas, which represents a significant financial burden
at around 60% of the foreign trade deficit (IEA, 2016). Reducing import dependency and
improving energy security are urgent, and have been reflected as a main national strategic
objective. As discussed in Chapter 4, support to domestic coal mining in Turkey includes tax
exemptions and low interest credits for prospecting and also for low-quality highly polluting
coal. In the short and medium term, phasing out these subsidies and reforming the incentive
mechanism seems a challenge in Turkey politically, given its drive for reducing its reliance on
imported energy and the considerable amount of jobs created around the coal industry. Turkey
may eventually face increased environmental and health costs due to the high negative
impacts and externalities associated with coal production and use. To build a sustainable
energy and climate future for the country, coal subsidies should be scrutinized within the
perspective of phasing out of harmful subsidies in parallel with the increasing use of
renewable energy.

As in many countries, the banks are the principal conduit for green finance to activities
particularly in support of SCP. Considerable funds can be generated through the capital and
equity markets and potential funding can be forthcoming from investment funds, pension
funds and venture capital. In Turkey, private banks provide favorable financial supports to
industries to produce energy efficient products or to improve their energy utilization, both
energy efficiency and renewable energy.

As introduced earlier, improving energy efficiency, particularly in SMEs, is already a key
priority for the GoT, as its benefits and huge potential are already recognized. However, some
market barriers exist for scaling up financing for energy efficiency investments, particularly in
SMEs, such as limited experience of Turkish banks in assessing energy efficiency


                                                                                              62
opportunities and project benefits; high transaction costs for small energy efficiency
investments; financing constraints due to high collateral requirements; and limited
institutional capacity to identify and prepare bankable energy efficiency projects (World
Bank, 2013). To this end, overcoming these barriers with necessary incentive adjustments and
collective efforts to increase institutional capacities is critical to make energy efficiency
investments favorable for SMEs.

Favourable credit terms through the banking system are also useful practices in this regard.
The government should use its national development programs to scale up and mainstream
financial support for energy efficiency. Specific indications about financing mechanisms for
SMEs and economic instruments in general, rather than simple intentions and exhortations,
should be included in national programs and strategies. The effectiveness of support to SMEs,
including soft-loan schemes, grants, and improved access to financial markets, should be
analyzed and improved.

On renewable energy production and consumption, well targeted support could reduce the
relative attractiveness of coal and contribute to improving sustainability. So far there is a
significant dominance of hydroelectricity generation among the renewables in Turkey.
Moreover, due to poor implementation of environmental regulations, hydropower
development in Turkey is often accompanied by undesirable environmental impacts, and has
resulted in irreversible loss of high value natural areas and river ecosystems. Therefore,
government policies supporting renewable energy, especially financial tools, should lean
more toward “sustainable? hydropower development and the utilization of non-hydraulic
resources.

On the consumption side, as mentioned in the previous chapter, although GoT has put
remarkable efforts into transforming the market towards energy efficient products,
particularly in home appliances, through harmonizing related EU Directives and public
awareness raising programs, yet, there is no tax advantages provided to consumers to
incentivize them to buy energy efficient appliances. Nevertheless, the country can do better
and more by improving its regulatory and financial instruments. In that regard, tax policy,
regulatory instruments, incentives and subsidies should be reviewed, and revisions should be
put in place, to achieve a market transformation towards not only energy-efficient appliances
but also other environmentally preferable and cleaner products and for the reduction of waste.

The provision of credits on favourable terms for investments and activities benefitting the
environment is quite prevalent in Turkey. Funds from international, multilateral and bilateral
resources contribute effectively to these arrangements through partnerships with local banks.
A call can be made to extend both the volume and coverage of such partnerships which, in
effect, are also supplying global public goods. Embedding sustainable banking principles in
the financial sector will help improve the capacity of banks in Turkey to deal with investment
projects with better environmental sustainability performance. Apart from programs such as
TurSeff and MidSeff, some private banks provide favourable credit and loans with
exemptions from certain taxes and such charges as the tax on bank and insurance transactions,
as well as delays in repayment and low rates for green housing, organic agriculture,
water-saving irrigation systems, hybrid cars, energy efficiency. Still, there is considerable
scope to expand the coverage and scale of favourable credits and make them more effective.

Potential new instruments


                                                                                           63
While taxes and subsidies remain the main instruments, a new generation of innovative
market based tools such as green bonds are emerging as a means for financing sustainable
production in Turkey. As mentioned in Chapter 4, Türkiye Sınai Kalkınma Bankası (TSKB)
issued Turkey’s first green bonds. Yet, the main concern around green bonds, in Turkey and
elsewhere, is the lack of standards or definitions – a grey area that allows for some flexibility,
but also the potential for exploitation. The danger is that this tool might be abused, especially
around “complementary? tax exemptions. So, in order to prevent “greenwashing? and develop
a credible green bond market, some form of standardization is required for green bond
definitions and requirements. Globally, the most widely accepted standards are the Green
Bond Principles of International Capital Market Association (ICMA), and the Climate Bonds
Initiative’s (CBI) standards. Adapting and diligently applying such universal frameworks and
standards would help boost market confidence and create the pipeline for green bond deals to
flow – both in Turkey and globally.

In terms of adopting new financing instruments for better implementing SCP, Turkey should
analyze international experiences in the light of its national circumstances and expand the
range of policy applications. As implemented in other countries, payments for environmental
services (PES) can be a promising avenue for companies to account voluntarily or otherwise,
for the total costs of their activities. For example, New York City ensured its supply of clean
drinking water by paying landowners to protect land surrounding a watershed. In the process,
the city avoided building costly drinking water treatment plants and additional infrastructure
to meet water quality standards. The city has committed approximately $1.5 billion
(averaging $167 million per year) to protect the ecosystem, whereas a new water filtration
plant would have cost at least $6 billion to build and another $250 million per year to
maintain (WRI 2011). As this is an area which is almost unknown in Turkey, it could be
useful to share successful international examples with Turkish policy makers and businesses
and look for pilot projects. Projects relevant to sustainability are undertaken within corporate
social responsibility (CSR) programs, such as banks planting a tree for each loan given, or
turning over some of the award points gained on credit cards to an environmental
organization. These are laudable initiatives and should be supported, but they cannot be a
substitute for internalizing environmental costs or payments for unaccounted environmental
services. It would be useful to create a list of environmental services that may merit
compensation, such as preservation of wetlands or specific natural resources. Environmentally
conscious firms can then make payments to maintain these services and compensate, at least
indirectly, for the environmental costs they generate. There is a need, however, to identify,
quantify and monetize the environmental services to be paid for and the harm for which the
compensation will be made. Considerable work is called for in Turkey in this regard. The use
of performance bonds, which can provide an important contribution to the rehabilitation of
degraded lands caused by mining operations and various other environmental destruction
examples, should be considered and the necessary administrative and legal infrastructure.

While Turkey seems fairly advanced in using international voluntary carbon markets,
establishment of a domestic carbon pricing instrument or market is much more demanding
and its development requires a systematic longer term effort. As mentioned in Chapter 4, in
2011, Turkey adopted a National Climate Change Action Plan setting clear objectives for
mitigation and adaptation activities, and specifically identifies market-based as a key tool to
mitigate carbon emissions. In April 2012, Turkey adopted a Measurement, Reporting and
Verification (MRV) Regulation modelled after the MRV framework of the EU ETS. The


                                                                                               64
regulation mandates about 800 installations, or roughly 50 percent of Turkey’s annual GHG
emissions. The PMR Project provides critical support to this process through 1) piloting the
implementation of the MRV regulation in key sectors; 2) a series of analytical and modelling
studies to explore market-based options, including a domestic ETS and other instruments,
leading to a policy options report for the consideration of the Government; and 3) extensive
stakeholder engagement to raise public awareness, provides training, and builds knowledge
and capacity within the government and private sector.

The outcomes of the World Bank supported PMR Project will provide useful insights which
should be taken into account in the future and build necessary analytical and technical
capacities. The policy recommendation emerging from the PMR Projects should be
operationalized. Learning from the systems mentioned in Chapter 3 that are working
successfully would also help. A good technical basis for tradable permits will also contribute
to expanding the market. The PMR Project would also help analyse possible carbon quota
allocation methods which would be the basis of the carbon price, how the allocation will be
managed, and how the price will be determined. Keeping sectoral divergences in mind, and
ensuring company participation, are necessary for the system’s success. It is also important
that the participating firms have MRV experience gained through the implementation of the
MRV regulation.

As the situation differs in each country, some instruments which are currently used in other
nations may be less relevant for Turkey: for example, debt for nature swaps because Turkey is
neither a big debtor nor a big creditor. However, new instruments may be worth investigating
for future consideration.

5.2 Policy Recommendations
As pointed out above, supporting SCP requires mobilizing financial resources from both the
public and private sectors, developing and implementing effective economic instruments,
ensuring policy coherence between different sectors, renouncing the policies that are causing
serious environmental impacts, and eliminating the underlying factors causing unsustainable
consumption and production behavior. The following is a set of recommendations the Turkish
Government should consider in its endeavor to support and implement SDG 12.

   1. Developing a National SCP Program. Turkey should initiate a process of developing
      a National SCP Program. Such a program should provide a long-term vision for
      financing and implementing SDG 12, specify the roles of the public and private sector,
      identify priority areas and actions, and install a comprehensive set of economic and
      financial policy instruments with predictable, consistent, and reliable results. The
      development of the national SCP program requires stock-taking and analysis of the
      existing policy instruments, gaps, and future needs in the sectors strongly relevant to
      resource utilization and pollution management related to SCP, and quantification of
      the demand for public and private investments needed to achieve SDG12 targets. The
      government then needs to quantify the investment gaps, assess implementation
      challenges and risks, and develop a roadmap or action plan for financing and
      implementing SCP.

   2. Improving coherence and integration of sectoral policies for SCP. It is necessary
      that Turkey carry out in-depth analysis to better understand the relationships –


                                                                                           65
   including tensions and possible contradictions – among sectoral policies and identifies
   and scrutinizes the inconsistencies between different strategies, policies, and action
   plans. In that respect, Turkey should conduct a comprehensive review of its
   SCP-related sectoral, macro-economic and fiscal policy portfolio; assess economic
   and environmental impacts of the policies, and understand how macro-economic,
   sectoral policies and fiscal policies in non-environmental domains shape up and
   influence the patterns of consumption and production. Furthermore, implementing
   SDG 12 requires strong coordination among various ministries, and more integrated
   management of information systems, databases and the analytical base. These will
   eventually help identify, eliminate or revise conflicting policy objectives and
   mainstream SCP goals and macro-economic, fiscal, and sectoral development
   strategies, policies and programs.

3. Seeking synergy between economic instruments and the policy response to
   climate change. Given the link between climate change and SCP, Turkey should
   reconsider its national climate change policies to foster the effective implementation
   of SDG12. To this end, setting up an ambitious quantitative GHG emissions
   reduction target and developing a mechanism for the monitoring and tracking of
   progress with adequate allocation of financial resources and provision of necessary
   economic instruments is vital. On the way to developing and implementing such a
   policy framework, existing economic instruments should be reviewed, particularly in
   the energy and industrial sectors with the largest share of GHG emissions. Further,
   existing barriers and bottlenecks in the field of renewable energy and energy
   efficiency should be carefully analyzed, and favorable incentives should be provided
   to expand those investments.

4. Sharing experience and learning through strengthened international cooperation
   and public-private dialogue and partnership. Turkey should continue to learn from
   developed counties that have a longer history of installing and using green financing
   mechanisms and have accumulated knowledge and experience in green financing for
   SCP. Public-private partnership (PPP) is critical to SCP. Turkey should develop a
   national dialogue on green financing and strengthen and expand the PPP in terms of
   knowledge sharing and learning and the implementation of SCP practices. A national
   platform for the dialogue and participation of the public and private sector could be
   useful to exchange and learn from experiences and build the capacity of players
   involved. PPP in the banking sector and capital markets would be one step for Turkey
   to finance SDG 12.

5. Monitoring and evaluating SCP financing. Monitoring and evaluation are
   important to the success of SDG financing and implementation. Turkey should
   continue to develop and consolidate its SDG indicators. A set of SCP-specific
   indicators covering resource utilization and environmental management should be
   adopted and monitored on an annual basis. Development and verification of
   SCP-related information and data should be strengthened. Natural capital accounts
   should be further developed and adopted as a monitoring and evaluating tool to
   support decision making on SCP activities. Meanwhile, assessing the value of
   ecosystem services and incorporating it into the SCP process would help investors,
   producers and consumers make environmentally sound choices in their SCP activities,
   and ensure the long-term sustainability of SCP resource use.


                                                                                       66
6. Setting the right incentives by adopting appropriate economic instruments. In the
   context of SCP, Turkey should improve the design and application of
   environment-related economic measures and MBIs in order to bring about enough
   incentives and necessary behavioral changes to consumers and producers. In this
   context, Turkey should carefully analyze the economic, social and environmental
   impacts (externalities) of existing coal subsidies. From a purely economic point of
   view, increasing the use of domestic coal is an option for reducing dependence on
   imported carbon fuels, but the environmental impacts call for a serious consideration
   of the eventual phasing out of these subsidies.

7. Introducing innovative instruments for supporting SCP. Beyond traditional MBIs,
   international experience as well as some experiments in Turkey have demonstrated a
   range of new and innovative instruments that can support the effective implementation
   of SDG12, such as green loans, green bonds, green infrastructure funds, carbon
   market, tradable permits, PES, and debt for nature swap. Turkey should continue to
   study and experiment with them within its country context and find the best situation
   for introducing them. In addition, voluntary-based measures for green finance also
   deserve special attention. Together with international organizations and private sector
   initiatives, Turkey should explore ways to put voluntary-based programs in place to
   spur producers and consumers to improve their daily practices towards SCP.
   Furthermore, Turkey needs to consider deepening the role of the financial sector in
   financing SCP-related activities. The government should seek ways, including
   legislation, to induce the players of the financial sector, such as capital markets and
   equity markets as well as pension funds and the insurance sector, to provide finance,
   especially long term finance, to SCP projects. The government should also take
   measures to facilitate the flow of information from innovative projects to investors.

8. Investing in public education to support SCP. Environmentally-friendly products
   and services require the availability of new skills for their production and
   maintenance, meaning that new business models would be high on the agenda, with
   new specialists to implement SCP. To this end, Turkey should develop its SCP
   policies hand-in-hand with technical and vocational education policies to train new
   specialists who have knowledge on cleaner, resource-efficient and low-carbon
   production technologies and the capacity to implement sustainable production
   methods in different sectors. Similarly, on the consumption side, it’s critical to
   understand that individuals have the power to shape the market by being aware of the
   amount of resources used in the production processes and turning to more sustainable
   alternatives. For this reason, Turkey should develop a mechanism for the promotion of
   sustainable lifestyles and support sustainable consumption choices through public
   education. Successful design and implementation of policies and measures specifically
   in support of SCP also require people trained in areas related to sustainability issues.




                                                                                        67
                            VI. Concluding Remarks
Turkey is committed to implementing SDGs. Regarding sustainable production and
consumption as specified under SDG 12, both consumers and producers are increasingly more
aware. There are policies and instruments in various national and sectoral strategies or
programs which relate to SCP. However, they need to be reviewed and reformed in terms of
efficiency and efficacy in order to effectively generate or redirect more financial resources to
support SCP activities and/or provide enough incentives for consumer and producer
behavioral changes towards SCP. New and innovative instruments must also be identified and
adopted. More studies, including those on political economy and enabling environment of
policy implementation and cost estimation, are necessary to ensure better integration and
successful implementation of SCP activities and their supporting economic instruments into
the new National Development Plan. This integration and implementation will eventually
help put Turkey on a promising path to achieving SDG 12’s objectives and targets.

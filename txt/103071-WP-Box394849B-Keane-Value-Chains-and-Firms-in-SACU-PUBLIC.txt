                    The emergence of the mainstream literature on Global Value Chains (GVCs) is an
                    acknowledgment of the increased importance of intra-firm trade in global trade, which is an
                    unprecedented phenomenon. This trend is a result of the fragmentation of global production
                    across countries, as they have become integrated within the global trading system through trade
                    and finance linkages. This paper explores the policy implications of the new GVC literature for
                    Southern Africa, including with regard to the expected, as well as actual, differences between
                    intra- and extra-regional trade patterns amongst South African Customs Union (SACU)
                    countries. The paper also explores firm-level performance to date, particularly with regard to the
                    achievement (or not) of economic and social upgrading, or other upgrading as highlighted by the
                    GVC literature, and relationship with end markets and buyers.

Executive Summary


Despite lots of new descriptions of Global Value Chains (GVCs) and new databases, there remains
rather more limited discussion as to what the implications of this increased phenomenon really
entails. This is particularly so regarding discussions on the promotion of intra-regional trade. Some
uncertainty stems from the clear tensions apparent within the new wave of GVC literature. On the
one hand, more recent additions to the GVC case-study based literature suggest that intra-regional
trade may be more amenable to some types of upgrading (such as moving from one function to
another) compared to extra-regional markets (because marketing and retailing nodes are controlled
by lead firms). On the other hand, given the degree of global fragmentation of production, it must
be recognised that powerful new trade opportunities exist for countries that lack nascent industrial
structures. This is because they can now specialise in a particular ‘task’ within a value chain , rather
than a complete chain. As a result of engaging with lead firms, rapid economic and social upgrading
at nodes of production may ensue, even if a change in the functional position of producers does not.

The case-study based GVC literature emphasises how the relative merits of participating in one
value chain compared to another essentially depend on how trade is managed and governed.
Attention is drawn in this literature to the drivers of GVCs and the nature of relationships between
firms that operate across borders; this is in addition to identification of the scope for governments to
influence these structures so as to achieve upgrading. Although entering into GVCs may upgrade
producers at a point in time and enable access to global markets, there is rather more limited
evidence on how to sustain productivity growth overtime. Debates on the achievement of learning
by exporting at the firm-level are still relevant. This discussion is amplified somewhat regarding
discussion on the relative merits of the facilitation of intra- compared to extra-regional trade flows.

In order to provide empirical evidence that either supports or rejects propositions regarding the
relative merits of trading on an intra- or extra-regional basis in terms of firm-level upgrading
trajectories, this paper develops a research methodology which integrates the World Bank
Enterprise Surveys and trade data. Our research objective is to provide evidence on the relative
merits of exporting on an intra- or extra-regional basis for firms in Southern Africa, and hence, to
draw policy relevant implications. These include in relation to trade-related interventions, including
those which may be operationalised at the intra-regional, rather than country level. We identify a
number of indicators of interest within the World Bank Enterprise Survey which are relevant in
terms of understanding how firms participate in GVCs. We move beyond the usual use of these
surveys in terms of interpretation of doing business indicators across countries, and instead identify
relevant indicators relating to entering and accessing GVCs. Our intention is to better integrate
firm-level analysis into GVC analysis. Although input:output tables have provided new insights
regarding country participation in GVCs, we have more limited information regarding the
characteristics of firms involved. Overall, we present new evidence on firm-level heterogeneity
across different types of value chains, including intra- and extra-regional value chains.

This study is organised as follows. In Section 1 we summarise the new literature on GVCs and refer
to evidence on the degree of participation in Southern Africa with vertically fragmented trade. We
then discuss the tensions that exist within the literature and here refer to the more recent additions to
the GVC case-study based literature. We then proceed to introduce our methodology in Section 2.
Here we set out the research questions to be addressed, which to the best of our knowledge have not
yet been tackled in the Southern African region. We introduce the data used to explore our research
questions and methodology. We acknowledge some of the limitations with our methodology, which
is a pragmatic one. These are essentially two-fold: first, they arise because of data limitations within


                                                   vi
the firm-level surveys and our inability to compare all indicators of interest across countries; and
second, because of the need to match products listed within these surveys with trade data (both
datasets use different codes).

In Section 3 we provide an overview of trade flows on an intra- and extra-regional basis. We
expected different products to be traded within intra- and extra-regional markets. Our identification
of products traded mainly on an intra-regional basis substantiates the findings of others such as
Stevens et al. (2013) in this regard. However, there does seem to be evidence of a type of
production network in operation within the region, as different types of metal products are exported
by South Africa to other SACU members, which also in turn export them back to South Africa.
They do not however, feature within South Africa’s major extra -regional exports. Despite this, the
links between these products and the automotive industry deserve further attention. The only
evidence we have of vertically fragmented vertical trade within the region relates to the textiles and
clothing industry. Otherwise, in terms of regional value chain development (with consumers and
producers being located within the region) we have the most evidence related to more consumer
orientated producers. To some extent this is surprising given the high share of foreign ownership
within firms operating within the region. The extent to which these findings support the multi-chain
upgrading hypothesis within the case-study based GVC is questionable.

In Section 4 we use a logistic regression model to explore the degree of association between
selected GVC participation and upgrading indicators on firms choice of marketing channel:
domestic, intra- or extra-regional for Southern African firms. We identify a significant association
for a limited number of firm-level indicators with firms subsequent choice of end market. Overall,
the results of the analysis suggest that:

    SACU firms are highly likely to experience major or severe customs and trade
       regulations compared to most other regions. As major and severe customs and trade
       regulatory barriers are experienced, the more likely it is that Southern African firms
       export on an intra- rather than an extra-regional basis.
      Firms with more experienced managers are less likely to export on an intra-regional
       basis and more likely to export to extra-regional markets. We cannot control, however,
       for the nationality of firm managers.
      Firms exporting on an extra-regional basis are more likely to be foreign owned
       compared to intra-regional exporters. Hence, investment may be a substitute for
       accumulated knowledge and skills. Put another way, a change in firm ownership and a
       new type of relationship with lead firms may be necessary in order to access some
       types of GVC. The strength of this result overall is driven by the fact that all exporters
       in South Africa have a share of foreign ownership.
      The more likely firms find an inadequately trained workforce as a major or severe
       barrier to their operations, the less likely they supply intra-regional markets. The
       reasons for this deserve further investigation.
        Firms supplying intra- rather than extra-regional markets seem more likely to provide
         formal training to their workers, though this result is not significant.it is to some
         extent suggestive of particular constraints for local firms supplying regional markets
         in terms of recruiting and retaining skilled workers, despite being more likely to
         provide formal training.

In order to further substantiate these results we integrate our results for SACU firms within an
African sample, and make use of the World Bank Global Enterprise Surveys. This means we are
able to compare the results we have obtained for Southern Africa to other African firms. Finally, we
compare our results for Southern Africa, and Africa to those of other regions including: East Asia
Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, South Asia, and Europe and Central Asia. These results are
summarised in Table 1. The odds ratio presents us with a measure of association rather than
causation. Although we are unable to identify the causal relationship, and direction of causality, we
can say there is a significant association. We also note though, that this association could be
spurious. This caveat applies to all of the logistic regression analysis presented in this paper.
Despite this caveat it is fair to say that the results overall indicate a level of heterogeneity across
firms included in the Enterprise Surveys according to the type of GVC they export to (domestic;
export; intra-regional exports; extra-regional exports).

Our identification of products traded mainly on an intra-regional basis substantiates the findings of
others, such as Stevens et al. (2013). However, there does seem to be evidence of a type of
production network in operation within the region, as different types of metal products are exported
by South Africa to other SACU members, which also in turn export them back to South Africa.
These products do not however, feature within South Africa’s major extr a-regional exports (within
the same product heading). Despite this, the links between these products and the automotive
industry deserve further attention. The only evidence we have of vertically fragmented vertical trade
within the region relates to the textiles and clothing industry. Otherwise, in terms of regional value
chain development (with consumers and producers being located within the region) we have the
most evidence related to more consumer orientated products. To some extent this is surprising given
the high share of foreign ownership within firms operating within the region. The extent to which
these findings support or reject the multi-chain upgrading hypothesis within the case-study based
GVC is questionable at the current time. The multi-chain hypothesis posits that domestic firms may
have more opportunities to launch their own manufactured and branded products within their home
market or in neighbouring markets, with similar levels of development. The types of lead firms
driving intra-regional value chains as conventionally understood (with consumers and producers
within the region) and their relationships with foreign investors within SACU could be further
explored.

Some generic as well as specific policy recommendations arise from this analysis. Comparing the
results for SACU to other African exporters, as well as other regions included in the Enterprise
Survey, we can see that exporters are more likely to experience high or severe barriers to exporting
in terms of customs and trade regulations, and this increases the odds of exporting more on an intra-
compared to extra-regional basis. Non-tariff barriers applied in the region are already known to
affect intra-regional exporters to a greater extent than intra-regional exporters (Keane et al., 2010).
It is important to note that our quantitative analysis is underpinned by the assumption that firms
have a choice in relation to their export market, and that this applies equally to intra- or extra-
regional markets. In practice however, we know this choice is not equally weighted and the more
qualitative and case-study based GVC literature emphasises such aspects as power, rents and
barriers to entry, in this regard. Understanding input:output processes at the firm-level and value
added processes at this level could help to shed further light on the constraints of domestic firm’s
integration with GVCs, and promote further dialogue with the lead (global) firms that drive these.
We not explored the role of imports into production from extra-regional suppliers, although we
know these sources have grown relative to African suppliers. This aspect of research deserves
further attention.

.Overall the exploratory analysis presented in this Working Paper could be improved in a number of
ways. Although we have described the theory which suggests differences in firm-level upgrading
trajectories depending on the end market, and provided some empirical evidence which
substantiates this view, case-study analysis would help to substantiate further the findings presented
in this paper. Panel data analysis for countries with the available data may be more revealing. The
distinction between intra- and extra- regional exporters for other regions included in the Global
Enterprise surveys could also be undertaken in the future. Finally, the robustness of results could be
improved, with some variables excluded from analysis so as to sharpen the results.

   The new wave of GVC
literature


The emergence of the mainstream literature on GVCs is an acknowledgment of the
increased importance of intra-firm trade in global trade, which is an unprecedented
phenomenon. This trend is a result of the fragmentation of global production across
countries, as they have become integrated within the global trading system through
trade and finance linkages. The new trade literature, which revealed firm-level
heterogeneity, has touched upon these issues, but the GVC approach to analysis
provides a more receptive and less abstract means of conceptualisation for policy
makers.
The latest wave of GVC literature has been accompanied by new descriptive
analyses, and datasets, which are introduced briefly in the following sub-sections.
However, as we emphasise, there remain some major shortcomings regarding
analysis of sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA’s) participation in current GVCs. Other
tensions are glossed over. These include regarding economic power, and
governance - aspects emphasised by the 1990s wave of GVC literature as
influencing firm-level upgrading opportunities. This literature which is based on
case-study analysis rather than input:output tables question the emphasis on GVCs,
compared to regional and domestic value chains.

This is because of evidence that suggests upgrading, and learning, opportunities for
domestic firms serving domestic and regional value chains (or multi-chains) may be
more forthcoming than within GVCs, driven by lead firms. Trading within GVCs
characterised by hierarchical governance structures, may offer domestic firms rapid
product and process upgrading, but the ability to obtain more functions within the
value chain over time may be more limited. Despite this, even if upgrading
processes are limited to nodes of production, entering into GVCs may help to
expand formal employment opportunities for low-skilled workers. This applies to
countries which would otherwise be unable to expand domestic production. These
aspects have not been explored to the best of our knowledge in the Southern Africa
region.

In this Section, we first briefly review the new wave of GVC literature, and
highlight the new insights it offers, as well as shortcomings. We discuss generally
why GVCs matter for regions, countries and firms. We then discuss some of the
recent findings for the Southern African region and members of the South African
Customs Union (SACU). We then elaborate upon the posited links between GVC
development and regional value chains in terms of upgrading opportunities and
challenges. Here we make the link to the firm-level literature. Finally, we discuss
why governance structures matter, in terms of influencing upgrading trajectories for
firms trading within different types of value chains: global, regional, or national.
Hence, we discuss how and why better supporting regional value chain
development may assist integration processes with GVCs.

1.1 Why GVCs matter for regions, countries and firms1

The term GVC has become wax lyrical in recent years. This includes within
different schools of thought and methodological perspectives. Although originating
from a sociological perspective and rooted within world systems theory, it has
subsequently become used by business analysts so as to better understand processes
of value creation and sources of comparative advantage and how to maximise these
(e.g. Porter 1985). Managing linkages within value chains effectively can increase
profit margins. Support services such as infrastructure, human resources,
technology development and procurement became just as important as core
business activities. The trade community became alerted to just how integrated
supply-chains are because of the effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 and
the synchronised global trade collapse which occurred. Since then GVCs have been
used to reinvigorate the trade policy debate (e.g. countries need to import before
they export) and have focused attention on behind the borders issues. For example,
Hoekman and Jackson (2013) argue that trade policy makers need to “think supply
chains” and recognise the integrated and interconnected nature of global trade
patterns. This literature tends to focus on intermediate goods trade, or vertically
fragmented trade.
More qualitative development economists became interested in GVCs from around
the early 1990s as developing countries became more deeply integrated into the
global economy. This literature was concerned about notions of economic power
and asymmetries in trading relations. It is derived from Global Commodity Chain
analysis and world systems theory, which emphasises how economic relationships
are constructed over time, rather than emerging spontaneously (Wallerstein, 1974).
The term GVC was used in the 1990s as analysis shifted towards understanding
how value creation can be influenced by local processes (Gereffi, 1999). Different
GVC governance structures were identified based on where economic power
resides within the value chain. Within this literature, there are some commonalities
towards the analysis of value chains across sectors including manufactured,
agricultural and extractive-industries (Kaplinsky and Morris, 2001).
Despite these differences, all perspectives recognise that global trade patterns have
never been so interconnected. Moreover, that trading success within increasingly
integrated global markets means entering and upgrading within GVCs. The ability
of countries to do so depends on many of the policy measures applied at their
borders, as noted by the traditional trade literature, as well as considerations related
to institutions and geography. However, success also requires consideration of new
issues and beyond the border measures, such as the effective management of
foreign direct investment (FDI).

New Trade Opportunities
As discussed by the WTO (2013) multilateral, regional and unilateral trade
liberalisation has greatly increased market access and, together with sharply falling
transportation and communication costs, this has facilitated the emergence of value
chains. Production that once was primarily located close to sources of major
suppliers of inputs (or near consumers in final markets) is now increasingly carried
out wherever the necessary skills and materials are available at competitive cost
and quality.
This fragmentation process has created new opportunities for developing countries
to enter global markets as components or services suppliers, without having to
build the entire value chain. By providing access to networks, global markets,

capital, knowledge and technology, integration in an existing value chain can
provide a first step to economic development – a path that is often easier to travel
than building a complete value chain (OECD, 2013).

Shares in Intermediate Goods Trade
Latest estimates suggest that around 80% of all trade takes place within the
international production networks of transnational corporations (TNCs), around
one-third of which is intra-firm trade – that which occurs within the ownership
structure of a single firm, or TNC (UNCTAD, 2013). Intermediate goods trade
accounts for 60% of global trade (ibid). Developing countries now account for
around half of global trade flows: developing economies accounted for only 34% of
world merchandise exports in 1980, but by 2011 their share had risen to 47%, or
nearly half of the total (WTO, 2013).
At the current time around 85 percent of trade in value added – or intermediate
goods trade – takes place in and around three hubs and the three regional blocks of
East Asia, Europe and North America (AfDB et al., 2014; 127; Baldwin, 2012).
SSA’s level of participation in this new wave of trade is worryingly low. It has
increased which suggests that the continent as a whole is engaging more with this
new wave of intermediate goods trade. But, the share of African suppliers’ in the
continents imports has been declining compared to imports sourced from outside
Africa; these flows have grown twice as fast as exports (OECD, 2014; 74). In sum,
these results suggest particular changes for African producers in entering into
GVCs and upgrading within them.

The Economics of GVCs
The cost considerations that underpin the fragmentation process of production have
been analysed by trade economists. For example, Baldwin and Venables (2013)
explore the technological characteristics of products and economic geography
considerations; they emphasise the presence of centripetal forces that bind some
activities together – a process that differs across products, and depends on the co-
location of certain activities.2

They make a distinction is made between ‘snakes’ production processes compared
to ‘spider’ processes. In the snake production process a physical entity follows a
linear process with value added at each stage, e.g. cotton production to yarn to
fabric to t-shirts manufacture. On the other hand, in the case of ‘spiders’,
production process may be many limbed. This is where parts from different sources
come together in one place for assembly; this may not be the final destination, as
any part of a spider might be attached to any part of a snake (e.g. buttons).

    See Keane (2014b) for discussion of recent new slants old phrases with economic geography connotations.

                                                                                                              ODI Report 3
They recognise that there are recognised tensions between the comparative costs
that create the incentive to unbundle compared to the co-location or agglomeration
forces that may bind some parts of a process together. The fragmentation of stages
of the production process is therefore determined by opposing forces of
international cost differences and the benefits of co-location of related stages. The
end result will depend on the technological relationships between stages of
production.
Given recent trends on the proportions of trade controlled by TNCs one assume that
increasingly complex and technologically sophisticated products are being
produced in fragmented chains, but that control by lead firms remains high (through
FDI), either because domestic capabilities in recipient countries remain low, or
because the benefits of co-location and agglomeration forces remain weak relative
to costs (since governing value chains costs lead firms). Both of these aspects - cost
differences and benefits of co-location – could therefore assist in explaining
Africa’s current participation in GVCs characterised by intermediate goods trade.

1.2 GVCs in SSA and SACU

Despite the headline figures for SSA, there are some reasons for optimism, and this
is particularly the case in the Southern African region. Intra-African trade in value
added manufactured goods - or intermediate goods trade - has grown, and more
rapidly than flows destined for the rest of the world (AfDB et al., 2014). The
Southern African region is a key driver of these trends as we discuss below.

South Africa as a driver
South Africa is seemingly playing the role of headquarter economy in the region:
its share of intermediates from other economies in the region increased nine-fold
between 1995 and 2011 (from USD78million to USD686million); South African
intermediates embedded in the exports of other economies increased five-fold over
the same period (from USD675million to USD3,487million).3 According to the
OECD (2012) and their estimates of GVC participation, South Africa performs
better than China (Figure 1). Their GVC participation index measures the relative
importance of imports and intermediate exports in total exports, or the extent to
which countries are involved in vertically fragmented production4

  This is approximated by the sum of (i) the value of imported inputs in the overall exports of a country and (ii) the
percentage of exported goods and services used as imported inputs to produce other countries’ exports. The shares
added describe the participation of a country in GVCs, both as a user of foreign inputs and as a supplier of
intermediate goods and services used in other countries’ exports.

                                                                                                                         ODI Report 4
Regional Dynamism
It is estimated by the AfDB et al. (2014) that Southern Africa, accounts for 40% of
Africa’s total GVC participation, one third of which is through backward
integration: the share of foreign value added embedded in a country’s exports.
Although overall, Europe and Asia are found to be the main sources of foreign
value added embedded in African exports, this trend is bucked in Southern Africa.
The reasons for the concentration of GVC participation in Southern Africa
compared to other regions in Africa are not explored further. The data created by
the AfDB et al. (2014) in their backward integration matrix suggests that other
regional partners contribute a range of between 0.01 - 0.1 percent of imported value
added into South Africa’s exports. On the other hand, South Africa provides more
than 10 percent of intermediate goods in Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.
 Although useful information is provided by the AfDB et al. (2014) the types of
products, sectors, and lead firms driving these value chains is not discussed in
detail. Moreover, the link to trade policy tends to be rather prescriptive, e.g. simply
corresponding to the current mainstream discourse of the need to import before
exporting, or describing how the penalties for infant industry protection are higher
now than in the past (because countries specialise in tasks rather than complete
value chains). Although it is acknowledged that African participation in GVCs is
limited to lower value activities within GVCs, no particularly innovative policies
are identified to overcome this.

1.3 Upgrading: Why it matters, and link to GVC Governance

The increased phenomenon of intra-firm trade essentially translates into more trade
within hierarchical GVC governance structures (Keane, 2012). Although the
hierarchical type of GVC governance is posited to result in rapid product and
process upgrading, the route to functional upgrading – moving towards a higher
position within the value chain – is posited to become more difficult. This is
essentially, because this route towards upgrading is blocked by lead firms who
control more lucrative nodes of production (Tijaja, 2012; Kamau 2009; Navas-
Aleman, 2011).

A typology of a GVC governance structures articulated by Gereffi et al. (2005) is
briefly described in Box 1 below. A hierarchical GVC governance structure as
defined in this framework (and so widely referred to within the GVC literature),
means that lead firms exert a high degree of control on their suppliers; this includes
through ownership and backward vertical integration. It is important to note that
this typology of governance was developed on the basis of case-study analysis, and
has not been subject to much more empirical scrutiny. Although hierarchical
structures of governance have received much attention within North-South trade
analyses, it is fair to say that other types of governance structures have received less
attention; this includes more relational types of governance which may exist within
South-South value chains.

Box 1: Governance of Global Value Chains
The types of GVC governance identified by Gereffi et al. (2005) are derived from country case-study
analyses. The typology is useful as it highlights the degree of explicit coordination within a GVC, which
is a function of the producers’ capabilities, the complexity of the transactions and the extent to which
they can be codified.

Market governance is typical where transactions are relatively simple, information on product
specifications is easily transmitted, and suppliers can make products with minimal input from buyers.
Trade takes place through arms-length exchanges which require little or no formal cooperation, for
example, carried out in auction houses or other spot markets, or other over-the-counter transactions.

Modular governance occurs when complex transactions are relatively easy to codify. Suppliers in
modular chains make products to a customer’s specifications. Information technology and standards
for exchanging information are both key to the functioning of modular governance, which means
greater control over transactions relative to the market-based governance.

Relational governance occurs when buyers and sellers rely on complex information that is not easily
transmitted or learned. This results in frequent interactions and knowledge sharing between parties.
Lead firms specify what is needed, and exert some level of control over suppliers but relational
linkages take time to build, so the costs and difficulties required to switch to a new partner tend to be
high. This type of governance is typically associated with contract manufacturing, but offshore
contractors may source inputs.

Captive governance is a feature of chains where small suppliers are dependent on one or a few
buyers that often wield a great deal of power. Such networks feature a high degree of monitoring and
control by the lead firm. The power asymmetry in captive networks forces suppliers to link to their
buyer under conditions set by, and often specific to, that particular buyer. Some cases of contract
farming or types of commodity trade can exhibit this type of governance, given low supplier
competence and complex transactions.

Hierarchical governance usually occurs when product specifications cannot be codified, products are
complex, or highly competent suppliers cannot be found. This type of governance is typically
associated with industries where all stages of production are carried out ‘in house’ as production is
offshored rather than outsourced.

Firm Ownership Structures
The more recent additions to the case-study GVC literature now draw particular
attention to the concept of social embeddedness, and why firm ownership matters
(Kaplinsky and Wamae, 2010; Staritz and Morris, 2013; Morris and Staritz, 2014).
This perspective on the motivations of investors and their embeddedness, the
destination end markets and subsequent influence on upgrading trajectories is also
shared by Goto et al. (2009). Generally, the emerging literature on the motivations
of investors relates these to potential upgrading trajectories, either at the node of
production, or across. For example, depending on the relationship developed with
investors and lead firms, there may be greater learning opportunities and
possibilities of technology transfer. But this depends on investors’ motivations and
the extent to which these have progressed from merely efficiency or resource-
seeking but towards relationship building.

These concerns are clearly similar to the literature on FDI spillovers. Farole and
Winkler (2014) discuss these issues within the context of GVCs. They argue that
FDI’s spillover potential—the productivity gain resulting from the diffusion of
knowledge and technology from foreign investors to local firms and workers— is
one of the most valuable inputs to long-run growth and development. Their
conceptual framework is built around an understanding of the mediating factors that
shape the nature and extent of spillovers, specifically: the spillover potential of
foreign investors (particularly in the context of investments within GVCs); the
absorptive capacity of local agents (firms and workers); and how these two factors
interact within a specific host country institutional environment. Clearly, these are
similar areas to those included in the GVC governance framework developed by
Gereffi et al., (2005).


                                                                                                            ODI Report 6
Box 2: Market and Investor Diversification
    With reference to the development of the textiles and clothing industry in Cambodia, Goto et al.
    (2009) conclude that exporting to the Japanese market rather than the US market might facilitate
    more efficient technology transfer for firms in the Cambodian garment industry. This is because the
    approach of investors and nature of relationships between firms is qualitatively different. Figure 1a
    presents the market segmentation for Cambodian garments developed by Goto et al. (2009).

    Figure 1a: Market Segmentation Classification for Cambodian Garments




    Source: Goto et al. (2009)

    It is notable, however, that the regional trade policy dimension is not explicitly referred to in this study.
    The reasons for this are not clear, although we know that Cambodia is a late industrialiser to the Asia
    Pacific region, where the ‘flying geese’ model of recycling comparative advantage and integration of
    countries within regional production networks - referred to in detail by IDE-JETRO (2011) - has driven
    economic development.


Making the link to firm-level performance matters, because although within the
qualitative GVC analysis, the ownership of firms, investors’ motivations and end
markets are receiving greater attention, it is fair to say the link to actual firm-level
data remains weak and based mostly on a descriptive rather than a quantitative
analysis. Where quantitative analysis of employment within GVCs has been
undertaken, it has resulted in some very broad-brushed statements on the superior
performance of GVC integrated - or FDI driven firms - and employment outcomes
(e.g. Shepard and Stone, 2013).

Firm-level Performance
Generally, firm-level studies continue to explore the existence or not of learning by
doing effects; it is fair to say that the trade and growth literature has come full
circle because of the results. The recent debate on trade and growth at the level of
the firm not only posits that the most productive firms within an industry export,
but also that such firms are likely to have been the most productive firms within an
industry before exporting, i.e. exporters self-select into markets. This is in part due
to the high sunk costs for firms to enter markets.5 Moreover, some studies find that
productivity typically increases to a greater extent before firms export, as opposed
to after firms enter export markets (Clerides et al., 1998; Bernard and Jensen 2004;
Greenaway and Kneller, 2007).

New trade theory is distinguished from old new trade theory by its focus on the
firm as opposed to the industry; it focuses more on internal economies of scale to
the firm as opposed to external economies to the industry which may result from
the clustering of firms (for example, as in new economic geography models). That
is, it is more in line with models of monopolistic competition that incorporate
heterogeneous firms and the theory of the multinational enterprise. However, as
opposed to considering all firms as homogenous exporters it introduces firm
heterogeneity: some firms export, others don’t, some firms are larger and more

 Because of external economies of scale: established patterns of specialization may persist even though they run
counter to comparative advantage (e.g. Swiss watch producers compared to Thai).

implications of firm heterogeneity for the boundaries of the firm and strategies for
outsourcing and insourcing of activities. Markusen and Venables (2000) develop a
monopolistic competition model of trade in which the presence of trade costs
changes the pattern of trade, creates incentives for factor mobility which may lead
to an agglomeration of activity in a single country and may therefore lead to
multinational firms.
Further to the recent contributions by Melitz (2003), Helpman et al. (2004) and
Bernard, Eaton et al. (2003), which reconsiders how firms participate in
international markets, the set of firm characteristics analysed has been extended to
include: size, age, human capital, capital-intensity and ownership. However, it is
noted by Greenaway and Kneller (2007:42-44) that: “Although the evidence
unambiguously points to the crucial role played by sunk costs, little research has
focused on what these are and how agglomeration, exchange rates and policy
changes affect them…other evidence is much less conclusive, such as that relating
to learning by exporting.”

Some of the few GVC studies that integrate firm-level analyses and make reference
to the effect of governance structures on firm-level productivity include Pietrobelli
and Saliola (2008). These authors engage with the issue of causality and the
learning by exporting hypothesis; they find that the governance of value chains
affects the productivity of suppliers in domestic value chains to a greater extent
than for firms supplying MNEs or exporters. They note that this result may be
explained by the different nature of information and knowledge being exchanged,
and by the larger gaps in knowledge and capabilities between the domestic leader
and its suppliers.6 Essentially, the case-study GVC literature describes how
domestic firms must collaborate with lead firms in order to access and export to
global markets. Given recent trends on the extent of intra-firm trade and that which
takes place within the networks of MNEs, this means engaging with hierarchical
GVCs which are driven by a few lead firms. Strategic alliances can be sought to
achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Policies can influence firm-level upgrading
trajectories.
Developing Upgrading Indicators
Given the theoretical and empirical developments within the more macro and case-
study GVC literature, and integration of firm-level analyses, there have been
increased efforts to untangle just exactly what it means to upgrade within GVCs.7
Because of these efforts have been made to assign quantitative indicators to the
qualitative GVC upgrading typology (Kaplinsky and Morris, 2001; Humphrey and
Schmitz, 2004) which include the following:

     Product upgrading: performing certain tasks better and improving
        quality of products.
     Process upgrading: improving efficiency and quantities through
        improving production processes.
     Functional upgrading: acquiring skills that enable movement towards
        another node of production, e.g. from production to marketing.
      Inter-sectoral upgrading: using skills acquired to move into another
        sector, e.g. moving from clothing production to motorcycle
        manufacture.

6
  As found by Pietrobelli and Saliola (2008) firms that service the domestic, rather than export market, can also
benefit considerably from engagement with lead firms operating within GVCs.
7
  However, some challenges remain since movement from one functional position can only be known through
detailed case-study and data analysis over time.

                                                                                                                    ODI Report 8
In addition to this, Bernhardt and Milberg (2011) distinguish between economic
and social upgrading. Within the framework they develop, economic and social
upgrading are defined as follows:

        Economic upgrading: trade performance, as indicated by export unit
         values and market shares.
       Social upgrading: employment and wage growth.

The economic upgrading indicators are essentially adapted from Kaplinsky and
Santos-Paulino (2005). Moreover, the analytical approach is essentially limited to
linking economic and social upgrading to a particular node of production as
opposed to viewing the movement of labour (and investors) across and into new
functions.8 Although the results from this research endeavour are insightful, the
ability to monitor these processes over time remains challenging. Movement from
one functional position can only be known through detailed case-study analysis,
and data analysis over time, and this upgrading strategy is excluded from their
framework.

Multi-Chain Upgrading
There is an emerging literature on “multi-chain” upgrading. This relates to the
greater learning opportunities available to firms serving multiple markets. In
particular, domestic firms may have more opportunities to launch their own
manufactured and branded products on domestic or neighbouring markets, with
similar levels of development. This literature draws on the experience of producers
in the textiles and clothing industry in Kenya (Kamau 2009) and furniture and
footwear industry in Brazil (Navas-Aleman, 2011).
Participation in multiple value chains provides the possibility of “leveraging
competencies”: different value chains create different possibilities for learning, and
what is learned in one value chain can be applied in others (Lee and Chen, 2000). A
focus on domestic markets leads manufacturing firms to broaden the scope of their
activities (i.e. functional upgrading) into design, marketing, and branding. This may
be because they have a better understanding of home markets than foreign markets,
or it may be because domestic customers are not as powerful or concentrated as
their counterparts in global value chains (Brandt and Thun, 2010).

The variance of governance types in end markets is related to buyer as well as
consumer demands. Hence, some aspects of the Gereffi et al. (2005) framework
(which is based on Northern markets) may be relevant, notably relations with lead
firms. However, one limitation of the ‘multi-chain’ literature is that it obscures how
and why FDI can be a substitute for domestic capabilities. For countries that with
extremely limited productive capabilities, attracting FDI and entering into GVCs at
a particular stage of production in order to begin capital accumulation and
assimilation processes, remains an important new trade opportunity. Overall
though, this literature concurs with our hypothesis that value chain governance
types vary according to end markets and this affects firm-level productivity, and
hence subsequent upgrading processes.

1.4          The link between regional and global value chains

Given the opportunities as well challenges which are acknowledged within the
literature regarding engaging with GVCs, particularly more tightly controlled and
hierarchical types, our hypothesis is that regional markets and value chains may be
more conducive to some types of upgrading processes by domestic firms, than

                                                                                         ODI Report 9
tightly controlled global markets. Hence, we expect there to be differences in firm-
level characteristics according to whether firms export products on an intra-region
compared to extra-regional basis.

These aspects have been discussed briefly in Stevens et al., (2013) with regards to
the development of African value chains. However, with regards to Africa more
generally, the case-study based GVC literature tends to either:

       remain focused on the effect of the Asian drivers on African producers
           (Fu et al. 2012; Kaplinsky, 2010), or
       refer to new demand patterns driven by the BRICS, including South
           Africa, with reference to sectors that are already well covered by the
           literature such as textiles and clothing (Morris et al. 2014; Staritz and
           Morris, 2013).

Where reference is made to building local and regional value chains in Africa and
within a GVC context, the implied logic seems to be so as to prepare firms to
subsequently export globally. For example, UNCTAD (2013) notes that “local and
regional value chains have vital roles to play in broadening the manufacturing base
of African economies, expanding productive capacity and boosting intra-African
trade” (UNCTAD, 2013:92). Furthermore that:

“Regional value chains present opportunities for improving productivity…both for
domestic firms with export potential and those that produce goods predominantly
demanded at the national and regional levels. For domestic firms…”regional value
chains give them the opportunity to upgrade and achieve international
competitiveness, thereby making it easier to connect with GVCs” (UNCTAD,
2013:92).

Hence, from this perspective, regional markets are understood to provide the
environment through which producers may learn and develop their productive
capabilities and capacity before integrating with GVCs. Demand factors as well as
competitiveness considerations are emphasised by UNCTAD (2013). Despite this
recommendation, it must be recognised that some countries (in particular the
LDCs) may have such limited domestic capabilities that attracting regional FDI and
situating this within an FDI-led development strategy might in practice be the most
viable strategy, at initial stages of economic development. The source of FDI and
investor motivations would therefore need to be carefully scrutinised, and
integration processes carefully managed. Getting data on investment in Southern
Africa, however, can be even more challenging that obtaining accurate trade data.

RI and GVCs: Theory and Practice
As developed by Viner (1950) in his model of a customs union, regional integration
can create trade diversion and enhance the supply of less competitive regional firms
that are now protected by a common external tariff at the expense of competitive
international supply. Much stronger statements are made regarding the
development of more producer-driven9 GVCs and regional integration processes by
others. For example, Humphrey and Memedovic (2003) find the emergence of
regional production systems in the automotive industry itself resulted in regional
integration. They make reference to these processes as driving regional integration
process with reference to the Triad regions: North America; the European Union

(EU), and Japan.10 These processes can be seen to continue with a self-reinforcing
dynamic, as most trade in value added remains within these regions.
It is well known that the history of European regional integration was driven by a
single industry: coal and steel. In comparison, open regionalism in Asia was very
much driven by the trade within the regional economic communities of
intermediate goods, without the use of regional apparatus such as a free trade
agreement or customs union. Instead, the regional integration process was driven by
the private sector. This included through the use of more bottom-up initiatives that
first defined, and then focused on the removal of barriers for priority products that
mattered for regional production networks and GVC integration.

In the case of Latin America and in particular Mercosur, Ciravegna (2003) finds
that both regional and global value chain integration seem to have provided positive
stimuli for product and process upgrading. As predicted by the GVC governance
framework, inserting a production unit in a global chain introduces pressures to
upgrade. However, the typical negative implications that may arise when inserting
an economic unit into a GVC did not manifest themselves. The hierarchical
structure of GVC governance was mediated, and the headquarter firms did not
absorb more links of the value chain. Instead, in view of the Mercosur treaties, a
concerted effort was undertaken to ensure that the Brazilian plant acquired certain
links of the chain, such as product development, and some decisional autonomy.
This study therefore highlights the importance of regional integration and
interventions that can be designed at this level.

As we are acutely aware the motivations for deeper regional integration in Southern
Africa are substantially different to other regions such as Asia, or the EU: SADC,
with a membership of 15 countries, was originally conceived as a bulwark against
apartheid South Africa and, by extension, the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU). SACU itself is not a Common Market, nor an Economic Union. Four out
of the five members of SACU operate within a Common Monetary Area
comprising Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland, but excluding
Botswana, which has its own currency. This is not a common monetary area in the
conventional sense: the currencies are pegged at par against the South African Rand
and not convertible outside their territories; i.e. basically all these countries use the
Rand. The SADC Trade Protocol was established in 1996, and since 2000 members
have started to implement their commitments; a free trade agreement was launched
in 2008. All SACU members are also members of SADC.
The new evidence on GVC participation in the region as elaborated upon by AfDB
et al. (2014) suggests that South Africa is a key driver of regional value chains,
both as a supplier of inputs and as a destination market for exports. But we don’t
know much about the nature of integration of other economies within SACU or
types of products traded. Nor do we know much about the relative merits in terms
of firm-level upgrading trajectories of supplying intra- compared to extra-regional
markets. We intend to shed further light on these aspects in the following sections
of this report.

1.5 Concluding Remarks

The more macro descriptive GVC analysis, and the case-study GVC literature,
introduced in the preceding sections has so far failed to critically engage with the
intra-regional trade debate, particularly in Southern Africa. This brief literature

review has demonstrated why we should expect differences in firm-level
performance indicators according to the value chain served: intra- or extra-regional.
We expect different products to be traded within these markets; these will be
associated with different GVC governance structures and hence, subsequent
upgrading opportunities. The research methodology deployed to explore these
aspects next is introduced in the following Section.

  Methodology: Firm-
level evidence on value
chain participation


The World Bank Enterprise Survey data contain a number of indicators of interest
to this study. There are some limitations, however, in terms of the availability of all
indicators of interest across SACU members. Despite this, these surveys are the
most representative across the region to date, and are also publicly available. We
therefore make use of them in order to better link GVC to firm-level analyses,
though we remain somewhat cautious in terms of interpretation of our results in
some instances.
Despite lots of new input:output tables to describe GVC participation between
countries, the link to firms and their characteristics remain rather weak (in spite of
recent trends in intra-firm trade). Although our primary interest is to research
potential and actual differences between intra- and extra-regional value chains, we
also compare firms included in the Global Enterprise Survey in general. This is so
as to draw out differences in the GVC participation related indicators we identify as
being of interest, and as introduced in the following sub-Sections

2.1 Use of Enterprise Surveys

The indicators used for the descriptive and quantitative analysis were identified
based on their relevance to the research questions, as well as data availability.
Because of data limitations we have not been able to include in the analysis
additional indicators such as use of website to connect with clients.
The surveys record firm-level information for those operating in the manufacturing
sector, as well as retail and services.11 For the purposes of this analysis we are
particularly interested in the manufacturing sector for the reasons discussed in the
previous section. Other sectors such as retail are inevitably involved in trade as
importers, but not necessarily as exporters. Although the tourism sector, which is
included in the services data, trades it doesn’t trade in specific products and
services exported by firms are not recorded. Hence it will not be possible in this
instance to link exports to specific ISIC codes, which is necessary so as to
distinguish between extra and intra-regional exporters and subsequently so as to
explore performance differences between firms.
Data are available for at least one period for all SACU countries, and two periods
for Botswana (however, we make use only of the most recent year):

     Namibia, 2006;
     South Africa, 2007; and
     Swaziland, 2006.

The total number of firms surveyed for each of the countries of interest is
summarised in Table 2 below.

Note: Survey data are available for two periods in the case of Botswana (2006 and 2010) though we
make use of the nearest years’ data. There are some slight differences in the availability of data
included in the country and global survey results for South Africa and Namibia. We use the country
surveys in order to explore differences in firm-level characteristics for intra- and extra-regional exporters.
We then use the Global Enterprise Survey to compare all regions.


Although information on end markets recorded in the Enterprise Surveys, it is
patchy. Firm ownership is an indicator of GVC participation because we expect
foreign-owned firms to be more deeply integrated in GVCs (intra-firm trade).
Firms’ uses of imports are also recorded. The enterprise surveys do contain some
information on the nationality of firms’ major owners, which we make use of to the
extent possible. The data therefore enables us to identify firms according to their
market orientation and ownership structure as follows:

     Exporter Type: Direct sales = 10% or more of sales are exported
     Ownership Type: Domestic, 10% or more foreign ownership

Data on specific descriptive as well as performance indicators are provided for
firms differentiated by these characteristics across the broad categories collected by
the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, which include:

       Biggest Obstacles reported by firms;
       Corruption;
       Crime;
       Finance;
       Firm Characteristics;
       Gender;
       Informality;
       Infrastructure;
       Innovation and Technology;

                                                                                                                 ODI Report 14
        Performance;
        Regulations and Taxes;
        Trade; and
        Workforce.

Table A1 Appendix reviews the data included in the Enterprise surveys across
SACU members and identifies those indicators which are of interest to this study.
This is undertaken if they meet at least one of the following three conditions:

    indicative of GVC participation: e.g. firm ownership (share of foreign
         equity) is a strong indicator of GVC participation.
    related to the expected outcomes of GVC participation including
     regarding the achievement of social and economic upgrading: e.g.
     formal training provided by firms can improve workers skills.
    related to a policy/institutional constraint that can directly affect GVC
     participation and connection to external markets (intra and extra-
     regional) and be addressed through regional integration efforts: e.g.
     days to clear imports through customs could limit GVC participation.

Through reviewing the Enterprise survey data in this way we were able to identify
specific indicators of interest. We then checked their availability across SACU
countries; this process meant we were unable to use many of the selected indicators
simply because of lack of availability. Table 4 summarises the indicators we were
able to utilise. Missing variables in the case of the numeric indicators - Age, Size,
and Manager’s experience - were coded as ‘1’. In the case of categorical variables
any missing variables were coded as ‘0’.

The purpose of the analysis carried out in this paper is intended to focus attention
on the soft infrastructure of regional integration (policy and institutional
development) as opposed to hard aspects such as the facilitation of access to
electricity or transportation systems. We are interested in indicators beyond those
normally reviewed as part of the “doing business” assessments. Nevertheless, we
still checked the availability of indicators such as connection to websites and use of

                                                                                                    ODI Report 15
the internet to connect with customers. Because of limited data we have been
unable to incorporate these indicators into the analysis. Table 4 presents the
indicator we have had to exclude from our analysis.

In relation to the use of direct imports, data are extremely patchy, and so we do not
make use of them. The responses are a bit better regarding the use of inputs: foreign
and domestic. However, there are still coding issues which mean we have to
exclude these indicators from our analysis. This is also the case regarding
information on wages. Because we cannot include analysis of wages in our
analysis, we are essentially limited to analysis of social upgrading. It is for this
reason, we also explore recent trends in unit values and market shares for the major
products trade don intra- and extra-regional markets for SACU countries.

As has already been noted in Section 1, the term ’GVC’ is becoming almost
synonymous with FDI. However, as we have argued, direct ownership of firms
through FDI is only one type of GVC and would constitute those characterised by
the deepest form of integration - intra-firm trade - and by a hierarchical style of
governance. Firms may still participate in GVC trade, but not necessarily through
the means of direct ownership and FDI. The first step in our analysis was therefore
to prepare the SACU dataset organise firms according to whether or not they
export, and then to explore differences in our indicators of interest.

Questions are asked in some of the enterprise surveys regarding the origin of
foreign investors, as well as their ethnicity. However, analysis becomes difficult in
terms of comparing the results across SACU members because of differences in the
exact questions asked across the enterprise surveys. Not all of the enterprise
surveys asked questions on the ethnicity of owners (e.g. Botswana does, South
Africa just asks if African or not, similarly in the case of Lesotho). Despite these
limitations, the majority of investors in Lesotho are of other African origin,
followed by Other Asian. In the case of Botswana, most investors are “African”,
followed by European and Asian investors.

A shortcoming of the questionnaire in the Enterprise Survey, as it currently stands,
is that it does not ask questions related to the nationality of firm managers. As we
will see later in the report this becomes important as the experience of managers is
identified as a significant variable in the quantitative analysis undertaken. This
result is interesting because within the new trade/new growth literature, firm
manager’s play an important role in diffusing knowledge and creating knowledge
spillovers.
In brief, although we have expressed interest in many of the indicators included
within the World Bank Enterprise surveys. But due to data limitations we are
limited in our ability to make full use of all of these. We first undertook an
exploratory and descriptive analysis of the data for firms in SACU and then
compared these to the results of firms in other regions included in the Global
Enterprise Survey. These results are discussed in Chapter 3 which follows. Table 6
below provides information on the availability of the indicators of interest for other
regions. We dealt with missing data in the same way as we did for SACU countries
(coding categorical variables as 0 and numerical data as 1).

For our quantitative analyses we were only able to use of the following:

    Firm-level   characteristics and GVC participation indicators:
     ownership, age, size
    Social and Economic upgrading indicators: manager’s experience,
     workforce education
    Policy and institutional barriers: labour market regulations, customs
     and trade regulations.


                                                                                                            ODI Report 17
Obviously the indicators included in these categories are debateable. For example,
some may prefer size (number of employees) to be included as an indicator of
social upgrading. However, we have organised the data in this way based on the
results of our literature review, e.g. new trade theory posits that only the largest
and most productive firm’s export to global markets. We then used a logit model to
explore the influence of firm level indicators on the subsequent choice of marketing
channel: domestic or export; we then further distinguished between intra-regional
exports and extra-regional exports. Underpinning our model specification are the
following major hypotheses, which are informed by Section 1 and the results
presented in the above sub-sections, namely that that:
H1: Alternative: there are significant differences in the selected indicators on firm’s
decisions (odds ratio) or not to export to intra-regional markets compared to extra-
regional.

This is because exporting to intra-regional markets may offer domestic firms
opportunities to achieve functional upgrading, whilst exporting to extra-regional
market may result more in product and process upgrading at the node of
production.

H0: Null: there are no significant differences in the effect of the above indicators on
firm’s decisions (odds ratio) or not to export to intra-regional markets compared to
extra-regional.

This is because similar firm-level capabilities are required to export to either
market, and firms that export to both have achieved a type of multi-chain
upgrading.
We test this model across the whole sample of firms and the following marketing
channels:
   o   Domestic market;
   o   Export market;
   o   Intra-regional market;
   o   Extra-regional market.

We specify  as a dichotomous outcome variable, coded as = 1 if firms produce and
export, and use  to denote the probability that firms export the said good. The
probability of an alternative marketing channel being selected is therefore (1 – )
and hence the model is specified as:

 () =  + 1 ownership + 2 age + 3 managers experience + 4 size
                      + 5 customs, trade reg dummy + 6 labour reg dummy
                      + 7workforce dummy + 8training dummy + 

We explore the influence of firm-level characteristics on the odds that firms select a
particular marketing channel and present our results in the following sub-sections.
This analysis is necessary so as to answer following sub-research questions and
hypotheses. These have all been derived from the theory discussed in Chapter 1.
GVC participation indicators: How do GVC indicators differ between firms that
export products mostly to intra- or extra-regional markets?
H1.1. Firms that export to extra-regional markets will be more likely foreign owned

H0 1.1: There are no significant differences in the influence of firm ownership
between intra- and extra-regional exporters


                                                                                          ODI Report 18
H 1.2: Firms that export to extra-regional markets will be more likely larger
(employees)
H0 1.2: There are no significant differences in the influence of firm age between
intra- and extra-regional exporters
H 1.3: We posit that older firms may be more likely to supply intra-regional
markets. The age of a firm is typically used as an indicator of learning by doing in
the firm-level literature. This is because in order to access extra-regional markets
alliances will lead firms must be sought, and FDI may be a substitute for
accumulated knowledge and experience.
H0 1.3: There are no significant differences in the influence of firm age between
intra- and extra-regional exporters
Social upgrading indicators: How do social upgrading indicators differ between
firms that export products mostly to intra- or extra-regional markets?
H1.4: Firms that export to extra-regional markets employ managers with more
experience than those that export to intra-regional markets because accessing
export requires accumulated tacit knowledge

H0 1.4: There are no significant differences in manager’s experience between firms
that supply intra- or extra-regional markets

H1.5: Firms that export to extra-regional markets are more likely to find lack of
workforce education a challenge compared to firms that export on an intra-regional
basis

H0 1.5: There are no significant differences in the extent to which firms consider an
inadequately educated workforce as a major or severe constraint
Policy and institutional barriers: How do policy and institutional barriers affect extra-
and intra-regional exporters?
H1.6: Firms that export to extra-regional markets are more likely to find customs
and trade regulations as a major or severe constraint

H0 1.6: There are no significant differences in the extent to which intra- or extra-
regional exporters experience customs and trade regulations as major or severe
barriers

H1.7: Firms that export to extra-regional markets are more likely to find labour
market regulations a major or severe constraint

H0 1.7: There are no significant differences in the extent to which firms that export
mainly on an intra- or extra-regional basis find labour market regulations a major or
severe constraint
We then tested this model specifying 1 as our marketing channel of interest.
Finally, we integrated the results of the Global Enterprise Surveys in order to
compare and contrast with the results of SACU countries which for ease we simply
refer to as Southern Africa.

Translating Product to Trade Codes
The second step in our analysis was to organise firms according to whether they
export on more of an intra or extra-regional basis. We use these terms to refer to
intra-African and extra-African markets. This second step was hampered by two
major (and one smaller) methodological difficulties. Whilst we were able to find a


                                                                                            ODI Report 19
way around them, they do mean that the results must be treated with great caution
as suggestive pointers to further field research rather than definitive statements.
The first major methodological problem is that the goods produced by the survey
respondents are classified according to the International Standard Industrial
Classification (ISIC) whilst the trade data needed to observe direction of trade is
recorded in the Harmonised System (HS).The second major difficulty is that the
trade data show the direction of exports for all SACU firms whilst the survey
covered only a limited sub-set of firms. This second problem was exacerbated by
the first: the ISIC categories are much broader than those of the HS so the latter had
to be aggregated into groups (Table 7) that will have included many goods that are
not actually produced by the Survey respondents.

The enterprise survey describes the economic activity that the firm is engaged in
and its main product produced; it then provides a corresponding ISIC code. We
have only made use of the main product reported in the enterprise survey (Product
1) and no others (including Product 2), though from a scan of the data most firms
produce goods that fall within the same ISIC code though we have not analysed
patterns in detail. Table 7 below provides an overview of the number of
corresponding HS codes for each ISIC recorded for firm in our SACU sample.

We piloted several approaches to minimising these problems and mismatch
between HS/ISIC codes. Distinguishing per se between goods that are exported
mainly inside and mainly outside Africa is not a problem. While there are many
goods, of course, that are exported to both markets, a significant number of exports
from SACU states are directed predominantly either to African or to non-African
markets (see Stevens and Kennan 2013).

Our initial approach began by identifying all HS6 codes exported by a SACU state
(in the same year as that state’s Survey – so 2006 for Namibia and Swaziland, 2007
for South Africa, 2009 for Lesotho, and 2010 for Botswana) to a value of $1
million or more and identifying the ISIC codes to which they correspond. We then
did a simple count of the ‘qualifying’ HS6 codes (i.e. those in which exports were
valued at $1 million or more) within each ISIC code to determine how many were
exported predominantly (50% or more of the value) to other African countries, and
those which were exported predominantly outside Africa. This gave us three
categories:

             1. ISIC codes in which over 50% of exports in all of the qualifying
                HS6 heads were directed to Africa;
             2. those in which over 50% of exports in all qualifying HS6 heads
                were directed outside Africa;
             3. and those in which some of the qualifying HS6 heads were
                exported over 50% to Africa and others in which exports were
                mainly outside Africa.

Focusing our analysis on just categories 1 and 2 would have been fairly robust. In
many cases, the proportion of exports in an HS6 head destined for either Africa or
the rest of the world was substantially greater than the 50% threshold. Hence an
ISIC group composed entirely of such cases could reasonably have been portrayed
as being made up of goods destined primarily for the African or the non-African
market. Unfortunately, of the country/ISIC code combinations actually cited in the
Surveys fell into category 1 and some into category 2. The remaining 34 fell into
category 3; in other words they contained a mix of some HS6 heads that were
exported primarily within Africa and some exported primarily outside, and so this
approach had to be amended.

The alternative from which the results in the next Section are derived omit the
exclusion of HS6 heads that were exported to a value of less than $1 million. This
brings into the net a large number of very small exports some of which, it would
seem, are relatively important for the Survey respondents who reported themselves
as exporters.
Unlike the first approach, the second approach classified an ISIC group as being
'predominantly intra' or 'predominantly extra' according to the aggregate value of all

                                                                                         ODI Report 21
covered HS6 exports rather than according to the number of HS6 codes that were
exported predominantly within or outside Africa. We therefore calculated the total
value of each SACU country’s exports of each ISIC group in Table X (by                   Commented [MO1]: Which table are you referring to?
aggregating the value of each component HS6 head) and then split the group into
two according to whether 50% or more of the value of these aggregate exports was
within or outside Africa.

This approach could have resulted in a misleading classification (for example if
exports were split almost equally between intra- and extra-African markets such
that an ISIC group in which 49.4% of the total was destined for Africa but the
whole group was classified as ‘extra-African’). But this did not happen. For
example, in the case of South Africa, for 19 of the 29 ISICs for which Intra or Extra
was clearly established the difference between the shares going to Africa and the
rest of the world was over 40%; for only 1 was it less than 8% with a couple at 8%
and the next smallest difference being almost 15%.
A third methodological problem was less serious because South Africa is the
dominant source of the exports recorded. It is that data for intra-SACU trade is
unreliable. An apparent South African export to Namibia, for example, might
genuinely be destined for consumption in that state and hence, legitimately, be
classified as intra-African. But it could equally be a product in transhipment to
Walvis Bay/Namibia for onward shipment that has been erroneously classified (for
a variety of reasons). In this case, since the ultimate destination is not known it is
not possible to classify it as either intra- or extra-African.

 Because we had based almost all of analysis on the first approach to classifying
firms according to the main destination of their major good produced, and used
these results to analyse trade performance in Chapter 3, we cross-referenced the
results of a 90% threshold using our old approach and the results with our new
approach (which uses a 50% threshold) and found the same products to feature.
Hence, we still make use of some of these results in Chapter 3 of this report, though
we emphasise that these should be interpreted cautiously and in broad-brush terms.

  Extra and intra-regional
trading patterns


In this Section we link firms to specific products exported, and identify those which
are traded mostly on an intra and extra-African basis in line with the methodology
described previously. We first present analysis of the types of products traded most
on an intra- and extra-regional basis. We then apply our 50% and 90% threshold to
identify those products mostly traded on an intra or extra-African basis.

3.1 Products Produced by Exporting Firms

Generally, the number of products that tend to be traded more on the extra-regional
basis are less numerous and hence to some extent more concentrated. The main
products exported mostly to extra-regional markets and produced by firms in the
enterprise survey, as listed in Table 7, include: furniture, other manufacturing,
processed fish and meat, apparel, car machinery.

Some of these products are relatively well covered within the existing GVC case-
study literature (e.g. furniture). However, more recent performance in export
markets has not been explored to the best of our knowledge. Nor has the extent to
which these products may be accompanied by regional production networks been
explored.
Looking at the data another way, and applying a more stringent value, and
destination market threshold, we can see that many of the same products listed in
Table 8 above, also feature in Table 9 below. However, furniture no longer
becomes the major extra-regional export from South Africa; similarly some of the
motor vehicle components no longer feature within this threshold.

3.2 Intra-Regional Products

Table 9 presents the product/country combinations for our intra-regional exporters,
using the 50% value threshold. We can see that Swaziland features as an intra-
regional exporter of ISIC1810 whilst only South Africa did as an extra-regional
exporter. Other products feature such as: manufacture of cocoa (ISIC1543),
manufacture of plastics (ISIC2520), and manufacture of other fabricated metal
products (ISIC2899). We expect this latter product to feature within an intra-
regional production network related to the automotive industry. However, we
expect the first few products mentioned to be intra-regional value chains in the
more conventional sense (producers and consumers are located within the region).
We then moved on to apply our more stringent threshold. From Table 10 we can
see that all of the same products feature.

Some of the same products discussed in Stevens et al. (2013) as mostly exported on
an intra-regional basis also feature in our analysis (which uses the same approach as
our analysis of extra-regional exports presented above). These products include:

       ISIC 2520: manufacture of plastics;
       ISIC 2424: manufacture of soap and detergents.

These products were identified by Stevens et al. (2013) because there are several
African exporters and because most of these products have relatively high regional
shares of exports. In our analysis, we have been able to link these products to
specific firms in Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. Hence, we can confirm that
these products are produced by firms included in the enterprise survey and are
traded mostly on an intraregional basis, which substantiates the findings of Stevens
(2013).12
It is likely that the products that we identify in the following sub-section also fall
within one of these categories: being an intra-African value chain in the
conventional understanding, or being part of a broader production network
operating within a GVC. We therefore encounter similar methodological challenges
to those discussed by Stevens (2013) which includes our inability to say:

       If these goods are regional value chains in the sense that some African
        producers supply African consumers – as industrial, or final
        consumers.
       or, instead these products feature as inputs to extra-regional exports.

It seems there are some types of production networks in operation within the
region. The following products are exported by South Africa to other SACU
members, which also in turn export them back to South Africa:

       Different types of manufactured metal products (relating to ISIC2899
           and ISIC2811).

The links between these products and the automotive industry deserves further
attention.13 In comparison, the following products are exported to South Africa by
other SACU members, and feature within South Africa’s extra-regional exports:

            Apparel (ISIC1810)

The following products are exported to South Africa by other SACU members, or
vice versa but then not but then do not feature as subsequent exports according to
our analysis, on an extra or intra basis. This suggests they may be more
conventional regional value chains with consumers and producers based within the
region (although they may utilise imported inputs):

       Dairy products (IS520);
       Manufacture of cocoa (ISIC1543);
       Soap, detergents etc. (ISIC2424);
            Manufacture of plastics products (ISIC2520).

Summary of results
This brief descriptive analysis has run through the main products and markets for
the intra- and extra-regional exporters. The descriptive analysis presented thus far

12
     This is the most up to date analysis of intra-regional trade flows to the best of our knowledge.
13
     For example Barnes and Kaplinksy (2000) discuss developments in the automotive components industry.

                                                                                                           ODI Report 26
has shown us that different products tend to be traded more on an extra- compared
to intra-regional basis. Moreover, those different types of value chain seem to be in
operation. Some upgrading processes may be easier to achieve within intra-regional
value chains, precisely because these markets are less dominated by a few lead
firms. Hence, supplying processed (and branded?) chocolate may be possible for
firms orientated to intra-regional markets, compared to extra-regional (where
processed chocolate does not feature as a major export). Differences in the types of
products traded within these alternate marketing channels may explain some of the
differences we identify in terms of firm-level characteristics in the next Section.

3.3 Firm-Level Characteristics

Here we explore differences in firm-level characteristics for firms that export
predominantly on an intra-regional compared to extra-regional basis. We only
present some of the main descriptive results in this sub-section, which serves as an
introduction to the next Section which applies our quantitative analysis.

3.3.1       SACU Exporters and Non-Exporters
Most of the firms included in the enterprise survey don’t export (Table 11). Hence,
analysis of “only exporters” reduces our sample size considerably, and is likely to
be reduced further as we split the exporter sample defined by their end market:
intra- regional or extra-regional.

In broad terms what can be seen from Table 11 is that overall the proportion of
foreign owned firms is smallest for the largest market (and producer) in the region
– South Africa, followed by Namibia. However, all exporters in South Africa have
a share of foreign ownership. Swaziland has the highest proportion of firms that
export, followed by Namibia and Lesotho.

The results of comparative analysis across indicators of interest - GVC
participation, social and economic upgrading, policy/institutional barriers - revealed
some differences between firms that export compared to those that don’t within the
SACU sample.14 In brief the following points may be noted:

       GVC participation indicators
        o Firm age: no significant differences between exporting/non-
               exporting firms.
          o Firm size: no significant differences in the size of exporting/ non-
               exporting firms.
          o Exporters are generally more likely to have international quality
               certification, except in the case of Lesotho.

14
     See Appendix 2.

                                                                                                           ODI Report 27
      o Exporting firms in Namibia and South Africa are the least likely to
        operate under sub-contracting arrangements, other countries seem
        to be more likely.
      o Non-exporters tend to have the longest length of relationship with
        their suppliers.

    Social/economic upgrading indicators
     o Exporters generally employ a higher share of skilled workers –
         those with tertiary education.
      o Exporting firms generally more likely to provide formal training,
        and pay more in terms of average wages for production workers
        (but not managers).
      o Exporting firms have managers with the most amount of
        experience, particularly in South Africa.

    Policy and Institutional Barriers
     o Exporters overall, and particularly within the smaller SACU
         economies, are more likely to experience barriers across all of the
         indicators we analysed, including:
            Workforce education.
            Labour market regulations.
            Customs and trade regulations.
We compared these results to those of other regions included in the World Bank
Global Enterprise Survey (Appendix 3). Further to this descriptive overview the
following points may be noted:

    GVC participation indicators:
     o Ownership: the proportion of exporting firms with foreign
        ownership is lower for other regions compared to SACU, e.g.
        proportionately lowest in South Asia and highest in Africa.
      o Firm age: There is a range of between 19 (East Asia Pacific) and 34
        (Latin America and Caribbean) years of operation for other regions
        compared to a low of 15 in Lesotho and a high of 27 in South
        Africa.
      o Firm size (employees): The average size of firms is highest for
        Swaziland (412) and lowest for Botswana (116), which compares
        to a low in the Global Enterprise Surveys of Eastern and Central
        Europe (176) and a high of South Asia (517).
      o International quality certification: The proportion of SACU
        exporter firms with international quality certification is comparable
        to other regions.

    Social upgrading indicators:
     o Managers experience: The results for SACU exporters range from 9
         years (Swaziland) to 19 years (Botswana) compare to a low of 13
         for Africa overall and a high of 21 years (Latin America and the
         Caribbean).

    Policy and institutional barriers:
     o Workforce education: Range of 6.7 (East Asia Pacific) to 24
         percent (Latin America and Caribbean) compared to a range of 12
         percent (South Africa) to 41.9 percent (Botswana) reporting high or
         severe barriers in SACU.



                                                                                  ODI Report 28
        o Labour market regulations: Range of 8 percent (East Asia and
          Pacific) to 29 percent (Africa) compared to 6 percent (Botswana) to
          32 percent (Namibia) reporting high or severe barriers in SACU.
        o Customs, trade regulations: Range of 8 percent (East Asia Pacific)
          to 36.7 percent (Latin America and Caribbean) compared to a range
          of 2 percent (South Africa) to 39 percent (Botswana) reporting high
          or severe barriers in SACU.

because of inability to categorise them as either producing goods traded on either
an intra- or extra-regional basis, overall we can observe the following:
    GVC participation indicators
        o Firm age: there are no significant differences between intra and
           extra-regional exporters.
        o Firm size: there are no significant differences between intra- and
           extra-regional exporters.
        o International Quality cortication: No major differences between
           intra- and extra-regional exporters.
    Social Upgrading Indicators
        o Managers with more experience tend to be employed by extra-
           regional exporters.
        o But the share of tertiary education for managers seems to be higher
           for firms producing goods traded mainly on intra-regional markets
           compared to extra-regional ones (particularly in the case of South
           Africa).
        o There are no major differences between firms in terms of formal
           training offered to workers.
    Policy/Institutional Barriers
      o Customs and trade regulations appear to be greater barriers for firms
           trading goods on an intra-regional basis.
        o Lack of workforce education tends to be more of a barrier for firms
           exporting goods traded mainly on an extra-regional basis.
        o Labour market regulations tend to be more of an obstacle for extra
           compared to intra-regional exporters, except in the case of South
           Africa.

Overall, the most interesting aspect of these results seem to reside in relation to the
differences between intra- and extra-regional exporters in terms of social upgrading

constraint to trade. We explore the extent to which these variables exert a
significant influence on the likelihood of exporting to either intra- or extra-regional
markets in the next Section.

 Analysis of enterprise
surveys


4.1 Methodology

Our objective is to explore whether or not there is any link between the indicators
we have identified15 - GVC participation, social/economic upgrading, and
policy/institutional barriers - and the likelihood that a firm chooses one marketing
channel compared to another. We undertake this analysis first for SACU exporters
and non-exporters; we then compare SACU intra-regional and extra-regional
exporters. Finally, we integrate the results of the Global Enterprise Surveys and
compare Southern Africa to other regions.

We use a logistic model since the results from the analysis are more intuitive for
those interested in GVC analysis. We are able to interpret the odds ratio for each
dependent variable as either increasing, or decreasing the likelihood that a
particular marketing route is chosen. We specify  as a dichotomous outcome
variable, coded as = 1 if firms produce and export, and use  to denote the
probability that firms export the said good. The probability of an alternative
marketing channel being selected is therefore (1 – ) and hence the model is
specified as:

 () =  + 1 ownership + 2 age + 3 managers experience + 4 size
                      + 5 customs, trade reg dummy + 6 labour reg dummy
                      + 7workforce dummy + 8training dummy + 
Because of data limitations, we limit the variables we examine, as specified above.
Underpinning our model specification are the following major hypotheses:

       H1: Alternative: there are significant differences in the effect of the
          above indicators on firm’s decisions (odds ratio) or not to export.
       o H0: Null: there are no significant differences in the effect of the
             above indicators on firm’s decisions (odds ratio) or not to export.

The following sub-hypotheses and research questions may be noted.
GVC participation indicators: How do GVC indicators differ between firms that
export products mostly to intra- or extra-regional markets?
H1.1. Firms that export to extra-regional markets will be more likely foreign
owned.
H0 1.1: There are no significant differences in the influence of firm ownership
between intra- and extra-regional exporters.

     Which is also informed by data availability across SACU members.

                                                                                       ODI Report 31
H 1.2: Firms that export to extra-regional markets will be more likely larger
(employees).
H0 1.2: There are no significant differences in the influence of firm age between
intra- and extra-regional exporters.
H 1.3: We posit that older firms may be more likely to supply intra-regional
markets. The age of a firm is typically used as an indicator of learning by doing in
the firm-level literature. This is because in order to access extra-regional markets
alliances will lead firms must be sought, and FDI may be a substitute for
accumulated knowledge and experience.
H0 1.3: There are no significant differences in the influence of firm age between
intra- and extra-regional exporters.
Social upgrading indicators: How do social upgrading indicators differ between
firms that export products mostly to intra- or extra-regional markets?
H1.4: Firms that export to extra-regional markets employ managers with more
experience than those that export to intra-regional markets because accessing
export requires accumulated tacit knowledge.

H0 1.4: There are no significant differences in manager’s experience between firms
that supply intra- or extra-regional markets.

H1.5: Firms that export to extra-regional markets are more likely to find lack of
workforce education a challenge compared to firms that export on an intra-regional
basis.

H0 1.5: There are no significant differences in the extent to which firms consider an
inadequately educated workforce as a major or severe constraint.

Policy and institutional barriers: How do policy and institutional barriers
affect extra- and intra-regional exporters?
 H1.6: Firms that export to extra-regional markets are more likely to find customs
and trade regulations as a major or severe constraint.

H0 1.6: There are no significant differences in the extent to which intra- or extra-
regional exporters experience customs and trade regulations as major or severe
barriers.
H1.7: Firms that export to extra-regional markets are more likely to find labour
market regulations a major or severe constraint.
H0 1.7: There are no significant differences in the extent to which firms that export
mainly on an intra- or extra-regional basis find labour market regulations a major or
severe constraint.

H1.8: Firms that export to extra-regional markets are more likely to find an
adequately trained workforce a major or severe constraint.

H0 1.8: There are no significant differences in the extent to which firms that export
mainly on an intra- or extra-regional basis find an adequately trained workforce a
major or severe constraint.
We test this model across the whole sample of firms, and as differentiated by the
end market as follows:


                                                                                        ODI Report 32
     o   Domestic market orientated;
     o   Export orientated;
     o   Intra-regional market orientated; and
     o   Extra-regional market orientated.

We explore the influence of firm-level characteristics on the odds that firms select a
particular marketing channel and present our results in the following sub-sections.
We then discuss the extent to which we should accept or reject the null and
alternative hypotheses. The odds ratio Exp (B) can be interpreted in terms of the
change in odds resulting from a unit change in the predictor(s). If the value is
greater than 1 it indicates that as the predictor increases the odds of the outcome
also increase (and the converse would apply if the value is less than 1).16
Essentially, it is a measure of association between the response variable (marketing
channel) and our explanatory variables. That is, the odds ratio tells us the
probability of a particular marketing channel being selected depending on the
explanatory variables.

The odds ratio presents us with a measure of association rather than causation.
Although we are unable to identify the causal relationship, and direction of
causality, we can say there is a significant association. We also note though, that
this association could be spurious. This caveat applies to all of the logistic
regression analysis presented in this paper. Despite this caveat it is fair to say that
the results overall indicate a level of heterogeneity across firms included in the
Enterprise Surveys according to the type of GVC they export to (domestic; export;
intra-regional exports; extra-regional exports).

It is important to note – as we have stressed in our methodology section - that a
significant and positive impact of high or severe barriers to production from
customs and trade regulations on exports may indicate reverse causation; exporting
firms tend to be more sensitive to the effect of trade regulations rather than
sensitive firms tend to export more. It is possible that firms which export attract
more foreign investment, as opposed to foreign ownership led to exportation.
Finally, firms that export more on an extra-regional basis may simply find demand
for skills is higher in these markets. All of these caveats should be borne in mind
regarding interpretation of our results.

The Wald statistic which has a chi-square distribution tells use whether or not the
coefficient for our predictors is significantly different from zero. In this sense it is
analogous to the t-tests found in multiple regressions. In terms of goodness of fit,
we refer to the Cox and Snell as well as Nagelkerke R square values. These
statistics are referred to as a "pseudo-R" statistics. The former takes the sample size
into account and can be interpreted as. It cannot however, reach a maximum of one.
Hence, we also refer to the Nagelkerke R square values which adjust the Cox and
Snell measure so that 1 can be achieved.17

4.2 Domestic and Export Orientated SACU Firms

The results for specifying specify  as a dichotomous outcome variable, coded as =
1 if SACU firms only supply the domestic market are presented in Table 13. These
suggest that older firms are less likely to supply domestic markets, similarly those
that are foreign owned. Firms that select the domestic market are also less likely to
encounter major or severe customs and trade regulations. Although the result of
16
  The odds ratio is obtained by exponentiating the estimate of B.
17
  We also examine residuals using casewise listing, as well as obtain classification plots, though we
do not present these results. Collinearity diagnostics were also undertaken through a review of
variance inflation factors.

                                                                                                        ODI Report 33
firm size is significant, its influence in terms of the odds ratio is ambiguous: it
neither increases nor decreases the odds of firms selecting the domestic market.

The results for specifying specify  as a dichotomous outcome variable, coded as =
1 if SACU firms export are presented in Table 14. We can see that the alternative
hypothesis must be accepted in the case of the influence of the following GVC
participation indicators: ownership; Firm age; and Firm size (no. of employees);
and Policy and Institutional Barriers: The customs/trade/regulation dummy.
Foreign ownership of a firm exerts the strongest degree of association with a
considerable increase in the odds (50 times) that a firm will export if it is foreign
owned. Because the odds ratio increases so much as the firm ownership predictor
variable does, it highlights the limited strength of association for the other predictor
variables. This result is driven by the fact that all exporters in South Africa have a
share of foreign ownership. However, because the Wald statistic is positive for the
other predictor variables this means we must accept the related alternative
hypotheses in these instances, although we acknowledge that odds ratio increases to
a much lesser extent for these compared to firm ownership. Firms that export also
tend to be larger, although the effect of firm size on the likelihood of exporting is
ambiguous.

4.3 Intra- and Extra-Regional SACU Exporters

We then moved onto look at the potential differences between firms that export
goods traded mainly on an intra- or extra-regional basis. In order to do this we first
specified  as a dichotomous outcome variable, coded as = 1 if SACU firms export
predominantly on an intra-regional basis. The results are presented in Table 15. As
before, we make use of the full SACU sample in order to perform this analysis, and
include those firms which we have not been able to identify as either mainly
supplying intra- or extra regional markets (discussed earlier). This means that the
independent dichotomous variable is only coded 1 only for those firms that produce
products we definitely know are mainly supplied on an intra-regional basis (using
our 50% threshold). We use the same major hypotheses as specified above, namely
that:

     Alternative: there are significant differences in the effect of our
      selected indicators on firm’s decisions (odds ratio) or not to export to
      intra-regional (African) markets.
     Null: there are no significant differences in the effect of our selected
      indicators on firm’s decisions (odds ratio) or not to export to intra-
      regional (African) markets.

The results presented in Table 15 for our intra-regional exporters, suggest that we
must accept the alternative hypothesis relating to the following indicators:
ownership; social upgrading; manager’s experience; and the following
policy/institutional barriers: customs/trade regulations, and workforce regulations.
These variables exert a significant influence (10 and 5 percent level, respectively)
on their association with the likelihood that a firm exports on an intra-regional
basis. These results are easier to make sense of when we compare them to the
results for extra-regional exporters. In Table 16 we specify  as a dichotomous
outcome variable, coded as = 1 if SACU firms export predominantly on an extra-
regional basis.

Taken together these results suggest we must accept the alternative hypothesis in
the case of the following:

     Ownership: Foreign owned firms are much more likely to export on an
        extra- rather than intra-regional basis;
     Managers experience: the odds ratio suggests firms that employ more
      experienced managers are more likely to export on an extra-regional
      basis than intra-;
     Firm age: older firms tend to be slightly less likely to export on an
      extra-regional basis (and hence more likely to export on an intra-
      regional basis) though this result is only significant at the 16 percent
      level;
     Customs and trade regulations dummy: firms that rank these as major
      and severe barriers to production are much less likely to export on an
      extra-regional basis, and more likely to export on an intra-regional
      basis;
     Firm size (number of employees): though this variable is significant,
      its effect on the odds ratio is ambiguous.

We expect firms that trade predominantly on intra and extra-regional basis to
exhibit differences related to the indicators we use as proxies for GVC
participation, social upgrading, and policy/institutional barriers. We have revealed
such differences through our descriptive as well as quantitative analysis. This
analysis could be improved though in a number of ways. It is standard practice
within the literature to introduce interaction effects in order to explore differences
between population sub-groups within an overall sample. A challenge in doing so at
this stage of the analysis however, is that we have only coded firms as either intra-
or extra- regional exporters within the overall SACU exporter sample. That is to
say, if firms export, they also export on an intra- (or extra- regional) basis. This
means we are unable to introduce interaction terms and proceed further at this stage
in the analysis. However, we can improve on this in the following sub-section
where we pool the SACU sample with all other African firms included in the

4.4 SACU and Other African Exporters

Within the African exporter’s sample, it is possible to introduce an interaction
effect for SACU firms and compare these exporters to other African exporters.
Although this means we are unable to shed any further light on the differences
between intra- and extra-regional exporters within the SACU sample, we can in
terms of how our selected indicators influence SACU exporters compared to other
African exporters.

In order to compare estimated coefficients between two different groups, such as
SACU and other African it is standard to run regression for a pooled sample and
include interaction terms of each regressor with the SACU dummy, e.g.
ownership*SACU dummy, in addition to regressors themselves and the SACU
dummy. If an interaction term is statistically significant, it indicates that the
coefficient differs between SACU and non-SACU. We present our results for this
next step in the analysis in Table 17 below.

  It should be noted that the sample we use for SACU is comprised of the most recent year’s data for
each country. In most cases, these data correspond to Global Enterprise Surveys, except in the case
of South Africa and Swaziland. Hence, we use our SACU sample and combine it with all African
countries (except SACU) included in the Global Enterprise Surveys. In the next Section, we simply
make use of all of the Global Enterprise Survey data.

These results and interpretation of the specified interaction effects suggest there are
significant differences in the impact (or association) of the following indicators for
SACU firms compared to other African firms:19

      GVC Participation Indicators
       o Ownership: There is a much stronger association between this
         variable and the likelihood of exporting for SACU firms than other
         African.
       o Size: Although significant for SACU firms the increase in odds for
         exporting firms is marginal.

      Policy and Institutional Barriers
       o Labour Regulations: SACU firms that experience major or severe
         barriers are more likely to export, whereas other African firms are
         less likely to export.
       o Workforce Regulations: SACU firms which experience these as
         major or sever barriers to production are less likely to export
         compared to other African firms.
       o Formal Training: SACU firms which provide formal training are
         much more likely to export compared to other African firms.

4.5      Comparison of SACU with Global Enterprise Surveys

The final step in our analysis was to compare the results of the logic regression for
our SACU and African sample, to that of other regions. We do this initially for the
full sample of firms included in the Global Enterprise Surveys: Africa, East Asia
Pacific, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, and Latin America and the
Caribbean. Table 16 presents the results of specifying  as a dichotomous outcome
variable, coded as = 1 if firms across the Global Enterprise Surveys export.

We can see that the odds ratio for the ownership variable for all firms in the Global
Enterprise Surveys is similar to that of the African sample (Table 18) though much
lower compared to our SACU exporter sample (Table 14). An increase in firm
managers’ experience slightly increases the odds of exporting, and this is similar to

and hence we do not discuss it.

the result for the Africa sample (Table 17). As a firm’s age increases, so too do the
odds of exporting, though the increase in odds overall for firms is marginal. The
labour regulations dummy is not significant, which is a key difference compared to
the African sample (Table 17). However, the customs and trade regulations dummy
is significant and this result is comparable to SACU exporters (Table 14). Firm size
is ambiguous. Firms that provide formal training are more likely to export and this
is similar to our SACU sample (Table 14).

Summary of Comparative Analysis
We summarise the results for SACU exporters, compared to Africa exporters as
well as those across the regions included in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys in
Table 19. We simply summarise the odds ratios across our indicators of interest
and denotes whether or not they exert a significant influence. Finally, the results of
our analysis of the individual regions included in the Global Enterprise Surveys are
presented in Tables 20-23 overleaf. In each case, we specified  as a dichotomous
outcome variable, coded as = 1 if firms export.

East Asia and Pacific
Surprising, an additional year of operating for firms in Asia Pacific (Table 20) does
not increase the odds of exporting. Firm managers experience matters though: as
manager’s experience increases so too do the odds of exporting. Firm size has an
ambiguous effect on the odds of exporting. All of our policy/institutional barrier
indicators are significant, though only the lack of workforce skills variable is
associated with a reduction in the odds that firms export.

Eastern Europe and Central Asia
Exporters in Eastern Europe (Table 21) are not only likely to find customs and
trade regulations a major or severe barrier to exporting, but are also likely to find
labour regulations problematic. The workforce dummy is not significant in this
instance. Nevertheless, foreign ownership, number of years of managers’
experience and firm age are all significantly associated with an increase in the odds
of firms exporting.

Latin America and the Caribbean
Foreign ownership increases the odds of exporting for Latin America and the
Caribbean (Table 22), though to a lesser degree than East Asia Pacific and Eastern
Europe and Central Asia. Firm age matters. There is a significant association
between firms that experience severe or major barriers to production because of
customs and trade regulations and their likelihood of exporting, though the odds
ratio is lower than in the case of Eastern and Central Europe analysed above. Firms
that provide formal training are more than two times likely to export.

South Asia
Contrary to expectations an additional years of operation for firms in South Asia
(Table 23) would seem to decrease the likelihood that these firms export. The
reasons for this deserve more attention. Interesting, this result is somewhat similar
to that of our SACU sample. Firm managers experience matters in terms of
increasing the odds that a firm exports, but the result is not as strong as for other
regions including Southern Africa. Foreign ownership of a firm matters as this too
increases the odds a firm exports, and this result (and strength) is similar to that of
Southern African exporters. Finally, none of the policy and institutional barriers
included in the logit regression are significant.

Conclusions


This paper has developed a research methodology to explore firm-level
performance across different types of value chains: those destined for extra-
regional markets, compared to those destined for regional markets. It has utilised
the firm-level information included in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys for
SACU members in order to do so. We have compared the results obtained for
SACU to other regions in the Global Enterprise Surveys. Using this methodology,
which admittedly uses some strong assumptions, we have revealed some
differences across the groups of firms defined by the export market, which arguably
warrant further attention.
Our identification of products traded mainly on an intra-regional basis substantiates
the findings of others, such as Stevens et al. (2013). However, there does seem to
be evidence of a type of production network in operation within the region, as
different types of metal products are exported by South Africa to other SACU
members, which also in turn export them back to South Africa. These products do
not however, feature within South Africa’s major extra-regional exports (within the
same product heading). Despite this, the links between these products and the
automotive industry deserve further attention.

The only evidence we have of vertically fragmented vertical trade within the region
relates to the textiles and clothing industry. Otherwise, in terms of regional value
chain development (with consumers and producers being located within the region)
we have the most evidence related to more consumer orientated products. To some
extent this is surprising given the high share of foreign ownership within firms
operating within the region. The extent to which these findings support or reject the
multi-chain upgrading hypothesis within the case-study based GVC is questionable
at the current time.

The multi-chain hypothesis posts that domestic firms may have more opportunities
to launch their own manufactured and branded products within their home market
or in neighbouring markets, with similar levels of development. The types of lead
firms driving intra-regional value chains as conventionally understood (with
consumers and producers within the region) and their relationships with foreign
investors within SACU could be further explored.

We have revealed differences in firm-level characteristics according to their end
market, and hence identified GVC related firm-level heterogeneity. Our approach
to analysis has revealed a number of significant measures of association, though we
are unable to identify the direction of causality (and association in some cases could
be spurious). This caveat applies to all of the logistic regression analysis presented
in this paper. Despite this caveat it is fair to say that the results overall indicate a
level of heterogeneity across firms included in the Enterprise Surveys according to
the type of GVC they export to (domestic; export; intra-regional exports; extra-
regional exports).
Some generic as well as specific policy recommendations arise from this analysis.
There are differences between intra- and extra-regional exporters in terms of their

                                                                                           ODI Report 42
firm-level characteristics, and the products traded between these markets differ
substantially. We have identified some specific product/country combinations
which may warrant further investigation. Comparing the results for SACU to other
African exporters, as well as other regions included in the Enterprise Survey, we
can see that exporters are more likely to experience high or severe barriers to
exporting in terms of customs and trade regulations, and this increases the odds of
exporting more on an intra- compared to extra-regional basis. Non-tariff barriers
applied in the region are already known to affect intra-regional exporters to a
greater extent than intra-regional exporters (Keane et al., 2010).

The quantitative analysis carried out is underpinned by the assumption that firms
have a choice in relation to their export market, and that this applies equally to
intra- or extra-regional markets. In practice however, we know this choice is not
equally weighted and the more qualitative and case-study based GVC literature
emphasises such aspects as power, rents and barriers to entry, in this regard.
Understanding input:output processes at the firm-level and value added processes at
this level could help to shed further light on the constraints of domestic firm’s
integration with GVCs, and promote further dialogue with the lead (global) firms
that drive these. We not explored the role of imports into production from extra-
regional suppliers, although we know these sources have grown relative to African
suppliers. This aspect of research deserves further attention.

Generally, the exploratory analysis presented in this Working Paper could be
improved in a number of ways. Although we have described the theory which
suggests differences in firm-level upgrading trajectories depending on the end
market, and provided some empirical evidence which substantiates this view, case-
study analysis would help to substantiate further the findings presented in this
paper. Panel data analysis for countries with the available data may be more
revealing. The distinction between intra- and extra- regional exporters for other
regions included in the Global Enterprise surveys could also be undertaken in the
future. Finally, the robustness of results could be further improved, and some
variables excluded from analysis so as to sharpen the results.

ODI is the UK’s leading
independent think tank on
international development and
humanitarian issues.

Our mission is to inspire and
inform policy and practice which
lead to the reduction of poverty,
the alleviation of suffering and the
achievement of sustainable
livelihoods.

We do this by locking together
high-quality applied research,
practical policy advice and policy-
focused dissemination and
debate.

We work with partners in the
public and private sectors, in both
developing and developed
countries.

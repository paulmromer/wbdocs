 1. Executive Summary

 As part of the fiduciary responsibility of the World Bank, post-review was conducted in June
 2014. The project became effective on May 3, 2012. The overall project risk for procurement
 was rated “high?. According to the PAD at least 20 percent of contracts are to be post-
 reviewed. Since project effectiveness, forty four contracts subject to post review have been
 signed. During this review period all 4 contracts signed were reviewed.
 The objective of the review was to verify the procurement and contracting procedures and
 processes followed by the project, and identify noncompliance with the agreed provisions of
 the legal agreement and applicable Guidelines, as well as to identify mitigating measures or
 remedies to correct procurement deficiencies and recommend them to the Borrower and its
 executing agency.
 The contracts under the post-review were found in full compliance with the procedures agreed
 with the Bank. The following positive observations were made: (i) filing well done and include
 all the documents duly signed; (ii) adequate competition ensured for the applicable
 procurement/selection method; (iii) most of the payments are made in a timely manner.
                                               3


2. Discussion on the Selection of the Contract Samples to be Reviewed and
   List of Contracts Reviewed

The following 4 contracts were reviewed:
Shopping (Goods) – 2 contracts (Euro 3,705.00 and Euro 39,611.00)
Individual Consultant – 1 contract (Euro 5,600)
Firm (CQS) – 1contract (Euro 19,980.00)


3. Findings on the Review of Procurement Processes
   The contracts were found in full compliance with the procedures agreed with the Bank: (i)
   contracts were awarded to the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidders; (ii)
   sufficient competition was ensured; (iii) all companies which submitted bids were informed
   about the outcome of the evaluation process. However, evaluation report for contract
   KARP-CS-14.1 was not in file only Minutes of negotiations was prepared.


4. Findings on the Review of Contract Administration
   Generally the payments are made timely, but some delays occur at MAFRD Finance Office
   who takes a while to process, especially for contract KARP-G-6.1. No delays in contract
   implementation have been registered.


5. Indication of Possible Governance Issues
   No fraud and corruption issues were identified.


6. Progress of Implementation of Recommendations in the Last Post Review
   The Bank noted an improvement in timely payments to the suppliers. The estimated costs
   were realistic and the contract amounts were close to the estimates. Adequate storage space
   was in place and contracts were signed by both parties before work was started.

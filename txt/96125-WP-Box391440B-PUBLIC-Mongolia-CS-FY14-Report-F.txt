I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Mongolia perceive the Bank Group;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Mongolia regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Mongolia;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Mongolia;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
              knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
              Mongolia;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Mongolia.
    Use data to help inform Mongolia country team’s strategy.
II. Methodology
In May-July 2014, 520 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Mongolia were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minster; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors
working on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations;
private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations;
the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 357
stakeholders participated in the survey (69% response rate).
Some respondents completed questionnaires through mail or with a representative of the fielding
agency face to face. Others received a link to an online version of the questionnaire in the
Qualtrics platform and filled out the questionnaire electronically. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Mongolia; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Mongolia; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Surveys
conducted in FY’07 and FY’11. Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder composition
in all three years, which allows for cross-year comparisons. Stakeholder groups which were not
present in all three fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged
to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of the FY’ 14
data and the total number of respondents each year are slightly different from those of the
original data. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown, please see appendix E (page 136).
A. General Issues Facing Mongolia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Mongolia is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Mongolia, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
   achieved.

   help Mongolia solve its development challenges, WBG’s local presence, WBG’s capacity
   building in Mongolia, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work,
   and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents were
   asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments
   in helping reduce poverty in Mongolia, and in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus
   most of its resources (financial and knowledge services).
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Mongolia, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Mongolia’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the
   importance for the WBG to be involved in thirty one development areas, and the WBG’s
   level of effectiveness across these areas, such as public sector governance/reform, education,
   mineral resource management, and job creation/employment.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate WBG’s technical
   assistance/advisory work’s contribution to solving development challenges and their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked whether they think the organization is risk-averse.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Mongolia: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Mongolia, and which services the
   Bank should offer more of in the country. They were asked what actions would most improve
   the impact of the WBG-supported programs and activities in Mongolia.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, levels of easiness to find information they needed, the levels of easiness to
   navigate the WBG websites, and whether they use WBG data more often than before.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Mongolia, which WBG agencies they work with, whether they think that IFC and
   WB work well together, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
          Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower levels of familiarity
           with the WBG (weighted mean=5.7) in Mongolia compared to respondents from FY’11
           (weighted mean=6.9) and FY’07 (weighted mean=6.5).
            Due to this year’s respondents’ low levels of familiarity with the WBG,
            responses to this question were recoded1 as “familiar? and
            “unfamiliar? to see whether stakeholders who are familiar with the
            organization gave significantly different ratings for several questions
            across three years. (Please see appendix F on page 139 for details).
            Results are also noted in the body of the report when appropriate.
          Respondents from the office of parliamentarians, PMUs, and consultants/contractors
           working on WBG projects had the highest levels of familiarity with the WBG, whereas
           respondents from local governments and CSOs had significantly lower levels of
           familiarity.
          Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
           with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Mongolia, and significantly,
           moderately correlated with their perceptions of the WBG’s relevance to Mongolia’s
           development, and its ability to help achieve development results in Mongolia.

       Respondents in the FY’11 Country Survey indicated that increasing income generating

       Respondents across stakeholder groups and levels of collaboration all agree that “job

       It is worth noting that respondents who specialize in “public sector governance/public

Where the World Bank Group Should Focus its Resources (continued)

        WBG should focus its attention and resources.
       Respondents who specialize in “public sector governance/public financial
        management/anti corruption? (14% of the sample) are significantly more likely to
        indicate that the WBG should focus its attention and resources on “domestic private

        more likely to indicate that the WBG should focus most of its attention and resources in
        Mongolia on “education? compared to respondents who collaborate/work with the WBG.

        mean=6.7) Country Survey.
       Respondents from PMUs and consultants/contractors working on WBG projects gave the
        highest ratings for the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Mongolia, whereas
        respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks had significantly lower

               Note: When comparing responses from stakeholders who are
               familiar with the WBG across three years, their ratings for the

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Greatest Weakness
       Respondents in the FY’11 Country Survey indicated that the WBG’s greatest weaknesses
        in its work in Mongolia were “not enough public disclosure of its work (41%)? and “not
        exploring alternative policy options (32%)?. Respondents from FY’07 indicated that the
        greatest weakness was “not exploring alternative policy options (30%).?
       Respondents who professionally work/collaborate with the WBG were significantly more
        likely to consider “the WBG’s process being too slow? and “WBG not being aligned with
        other donors’ work? as the organization’s greatest weaknesses, compared to those who
        do not collaborate with the WBG.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
       Respondents across stakeholder groups gave statistically similar ratings for the WBG’s
        effectiveness in all thirty one development areas except its effectiveness in work in
        “health.? Respondents from PMUs and consultants/contractors working on WBG projects
        had the highest ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in “health,? whereas respondents
        from the media had significantly lower ratings.
       Respondents who specialize in “public sector governance/public financial
        management/anti corruption? (14% of the sample) gave significantly higher ratings for
        the WBG’s effectiveness in “public sector governance/reform? “education? and “mineral
        resource management? than respondents from other areas of specialization.
       Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 70) that primarily
        informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
        “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
        areas.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations can be found in the
        Appendix.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Mongolia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
        Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
        areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Mongolia.
        The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at trade and exports; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at mineral resource management.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Mongolia, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at transport.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates
The World Bank Group’s Work in Mongolia
       Respondents in this year’s Country Survey tended to have significantly lower levels of
        agreement with almost all three statements (except “the WBG support programs and
        strategies that are realistic for Mongolia?) compared to respondents in FY’07.
       Respondents in this year’s Country Survey also had significantly lower levels of
        agreement with the statement that “the WBG currently plays a relevant role in
        development in Mongolia? compared respondents in the FY’11 Country Survey.
       Respondents from PMUs and consultants/contractors tended to have the highest levels of
        agreement that “the WBG’s work is aligned with what I consider the development
        priorities for Mongolia,? whereas respondents from the Office of President/Prime
        Minister/Ministers and the media had significantly lower levels of agreement.
       Respondents who professionally collaborate/work with WBG tended to have significantly
        higher levels of agreement with all three statements compared to respondents who do not
        professionally collaborate/work with WBG.

Appendix E: Responses to All Questions by Year3
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY14 data and the total number of
respondents each year will be slightly different from those in other appendices..

FY ’07 Number of comparable respondents = 255  FY ’11 Number of comparable respondents = 274 
                        FY ’14 Number of comparable respondents = 295
By weighting, all three years have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

  7   A growing middle class
  8   Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas

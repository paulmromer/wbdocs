                  Promoting Accountability and Justice Sector Service Delivery
                MNA Regional Program – Center for Mediterranean Integration (CMI)


Background
The Arab Spring launched a period of transition within the MNA region, which has allowed some
governments to initiate reforms aimed at enhancing openness within the public sector. As governments
in the Southern Mediterranean start to build new democratic foundations for their countries, citizens are
demanding more openness in government. They are calling for greater civic participation in public
affairs, and seeking ways to make their governments more transparent, responsive, accountable, and
effective. The current political transitions offer a unique opportunity to address these challenges, to
which the Bank is responding.
In March 2012, a seminar on ‘Open Government and Access to Information’ was held in Tunis, in
cooperation between the Bank, the Government of Tunisia and the European Union, and with
participation by MENA governments and representatives from Canada, France, Morocco, Egypt,
Mexico and Slovenia. The objectives of the workshop were: 1) to raise awareness among citizens of
the rights included in the new Tunisian Access to Information Law, and the procedures for exercising
these rights; 2) to raise awareness of public sector officials on their new responsibilities and duties; and
3) sharing international experience in implementing access to information regimes. In June of 2012, a
workshop on good governance was held in Rabat, with participants from government and CSOs
representing Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Libya.
Building on this opportunity, the Public Sector Reform Unit in MNA (MNSPS) and the Center for
Mediterranean Integration (CMI) have developed an ‘Open Government Initiatives’ program. The
program aims to support open government reforms that promote greater transparency and accountability
of government operations, and enhance the delivery of public sector services. In particular, support
will focus on issues of importance in the transitional phase. The basis for the support will be
just-in-time technical assistance based on the priorities identified by key government and CSO
counterparts. Activities will support and complement programs already underway through the Bank
and other development agencies. Support will be targeted to members of the CMI (Morocco, Tunisia,
Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon), Libya and West Bank & Gaza, with particular focus on countries under
transition.
The program will be implemented in a manner to maximize cooperation with other international
organizations. In particular, activities will be coordinated with the OECD-MENA Working Group on
Open and Innovative Government, of which MNA governments are members, and with the OECD
benchmarking of open government reforms, based on the criteria of the Open Government Partnership,
in Jordan, Tunisia and Morocco. Additional cooperation is envisioned with the Council of Europe, the
Basel Institute on Governance and the Open Society Institute. Efforts will be made to collaborate with
GIZ and France, which are respectively partner and member of CMI. Civil society organizations will
also play a role, both in terms of development and implementation of activities.

Development Objective
The development objective is to provide just-in-time, capacity-building TA in support of open
government to key stakeholders, including public sector institutions and CSOs, in transition countries.
Activities will be developed based on priority areas identified by stakeholders that result in further
enhancements to open government, in particular those areas covering accountability mechanisms and
delivery of justice sector services. These activities will also focus on exchanging knowledge within
MNA and between CMI stakeholders and partners, as well as relevant experience from other transition
events. Additional resources (trust funds, Bank budget) will be sought to further support areas where
        the most traction is gained.

        Alignment with CMI 2.0 Strategy
        This program will further one of the aims of the CMI 2.0 strategy – to support participatory governance.
        Activities will focus on developing mechanisms to hold public sector agencies accountable and
        improving delivery of services to the most poor and vulnerable citizens, both of which will enhance
        local empowerment. Capacity will be built in key agencies, including in the justice sector, to manage
        and address complaints against the public sector. Citizens will gain tools to help address corruption and
        abuse within executive agencies. Improving delivery of justice sector services to the poor will have a
        considerable impact on poor women, who tend to be the most disadvantaged when services are not
        properly targeted or delivered. And officials will gain knowledge and experience from leaders that
        guided their own countries through transition.

        Activities
        Component 1: Targeted Technical Assistance to Accountability Institutions – The lack of
        accountability of public sector institutions, and their staff, prior to the Arab Spring led to a situation of
        poor delivery of services and unchecked corruption. Since then, transition governments have made
        attempts to improve accountability both by building capacity of existing institutions and creating new
        mechanisms to address complaints. Such institutions and mechanisms include ombudsmen,
        anti-corruption commissions and public sector complaints hotlines. To date the Bank has received two
        requests for targeted assistance.
        The first request is to provide TA to the public sector complaints hotline established by the Government
        of Tunisia (GoT). The hotline receives complaints related to corruption and abuse in the public sector.
        The aim of its establishment was to provide a ‘quick win’ in addressing complaints against public sector
        institutions. However, it has only limited capacity to manage complaints and other ‘back office
        functions’. As a matter of priority, the GoT, through the Office of the Director General for
        e-Government of the Office of the President, requested TA to strengthen capacity of the hotline to
        ensure complaints are effectively addressed in a timely manner.
        The TA will focus on the following activities:
  i.   Establishing standard procedures for receiving and processing complaints
 ii.   Building back office functions to support case management
iii.   Developing system for tracking complaints forwarded to other public sector agencies
iv.    Enhancing IT to support automated case management system
 v.    Compiling and analyzing data to support effective planning and reform priorities
vi.    Developing model annual and thematic reports

        These activities will build upon similar TA conducted by the Bank with accountability institutions in
        other countries, including Jordan (Ombudsman, Public Sector Complaints Hotline, Anti-Corruption
        Commission) and Iraq (Shura Council – administrative courts and civil service disciplinary system).
        This knowledge, as well as that developed in Tunisia, will be further disseminated within transition
        countries on a demand-driven basis. As resources permit, and based on demand from other institutions,
        similar activities will be conducted in other transition countries, for example with the Ombudsman in
        Morocco.
        The second request is to provide TA to the Arab Council for Judicial and Legal Studies (ACJLS).
        Based in Jordan, ACJLS has board members from across the MNA region (Jordan, Egypt, Iraq,
        Palestine, Algeria and Lebanon). It is an initiative to develop to the justice sector from within the
        region, while at the same time introducing international experience. Its goals are to (i) support
        professional development and independence of the judiciary through training, (ii) facilitate interaction
        and coordination among judicial system institutions, and (iii) support the transparency of judicial
        systems and procedures. It aims to achieve these goals by enhancing information-sharing, developing
        and implementing capacity-building for justice sector institutions, and raising public awareness related
        to judicial transparency and accountability. The post-Arab Spring atmosphere has created an
        environment for ACJLS to gear up activities related to promoting accountability within the judiciary and
        ensuring judiciaries are able to hold executives accountable for violations of law and regulations, and for
     poor delivery of services.
     The TA with ACJLS would focus on the following:
 i. Developing the ACJLS interim strategy on capacity-building and analytical work to address the role of
     judiciaries in transition settings
ii. Developing indicators for monitoring and evaluating judicial performance


         Component 2: Enhance Access to Justice for the Poor – In FY11 CMI funded assessment of the
         demand-side of justice sector services for the poor in Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. With funding from the
         Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF), the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) and the Institutional
         Development Fund (IDF), the Bank has been implementing programs aimed at improving legal aid
         services (information, counseling and representation) and other services targeted to the poor
         (waiver/deferment of court fees, alimony funds, expedited child support and inheritance procedures).
         Programs were guided by the MNA GAC funded study ‘Justice Sector Service Delivery to the Poor:
         How Are Middle East Governments Addressing Gaps?’, which covered Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon,
         Syria and West Bank & Gaza. Together these activities provide a solid basis for building capacity
         within the region to improve service delivery to the most vulnerable persons.
         Building on these programs, this component will comprise of TA to interested counterparts along the
         following lines:
  i.   Improving delivery of legal aid services (enhancing and expanding service providers, simplifying
         procedures and eligibility criteria, improving monitoring and evaluation) and other services targeted to
         the poor (alimony funds; simplified alimony, child support and inheritance procedures)
ii.    Capacity-building to institutions delivering services (courts, bar associations, CSOs, ministries of justice
         and judicial councils)
iii.   Assessing the demand-side of services for poor communities
iv.    Policy development to underpin improved service delivery, including building capacity to compile and
         analyze data to inform policy on reform and strategy development

        Stakeholders in Morocco (Ministry of Justice, CSOs), Lebanon (Ministry of Justice, Family Courts,
        CSOs) and West Bank and Gaza (Family Courts, Alimony Fund) have already requested TA in this
        sector.

       Partnerships
       The CMI 2.0 strategy is articulated around multi-partner activities and cooperation with stakeholders
       from both rims of the Mediterranean including international organizations. This proposed program will
       be implemented in cooperation, to the extent possible, with a number of other organizations, including:
     Council of Europe (Anti-Corruption Directorate)
     Euro-Arab Institute (INSTEA)
     Basil Institute on Governance
     Ministry of Justice – Spain
     Open Society Institute – Rule of Law Program (Budapest)
     The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice - CEPEJ

        The program will be coordinated through CMI representatives from Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon
        and Egypt, allowing them the opportunity to provide input to the prioritization of programs.
        Opportunities for participation by GIZ and France will also be explored. Local organizations, such as
        CSOs, think tanks and universities, will be integrated in the process of implementation as feasible.

        Monitoring and Evaluation
        The program will be supervised by the Bank TTL. A status report will be provided six months after
        initiation of the program, and a completion report provided to CMI upon completion of the program.
        The CMI policy on M&E does not require a results framework at inception. Consistent with this
   policy, the following additional steps will be taken in cooperation with CMI:
 Outputs will be monitored through the CMI logframe, which will be updated every six months
 Outcomes will be reported to CMI, based on the logframe, as part of the CMI standard completion report,
   and progress towards outcomes will be reported every six months
 Outcomes will also be reported as part of the CMI-wide results framework currently under development


   Budget
   The current budget is $200,000 ($150,000 from CMI MDTF, $50,000 BB).

   Timeframe
   It is expected to have all activities completed within twelve months from the start of the program. A
   detailed schedule of activities will be provided to CMI once all partners and activities have been fully
   planned.
                                                   Rencontre Valmer
                          “Justice Sector services across the Mediterranean: Access for All?
                                        Center for Mediterranean Integration
                                       May 22-23, 2013 – Villa Valmer, Marseille

Citizen grievances driving the ‘Arab Spring’ stemmed in part from the lack of accountability of powerful executive
branches of government and the non-delivery of basic service delivery linked with good governance. Justice sector
services were heavily top-down in development and implementation, were often not targeted to demand, and
remained mostly inaccessible to the most poor and vulnerable citizens. Courts were too often used against citizens,
rather than to offer them protection or at least provide adequate levels of service to promote social and
development.
The public discontent over accountability and service delivery has prompted some governments to initiate reforms
aimed at enhancing accountability mechanisms and improving delivery of justice sector services. Such reforms can be
difficult to implement under the most ideal circumstances – factors related to transition periods add additional
complications, such as heightened expectations and the need to demonstrate quick results.
This Rencontre will provide an opportunity to take a step back from the developments of the last two years and to
shed light on the continuing improvements taking shape with regards to services in the justice sector. Like services in
other sectors, those in the justice sector may prove more difficult for poor persons to access. The obstacles they face
include considerable lack of awareness of available services and the procedures they must undertake to access them,
complicated procedures for accessing services, non-existence of services in practice, and the relatively high costs
related fees. In recognition of these obstacles, governments in the Middle East and North Africa region have taken
some steps to fill gaps in service delivery through the provision of legal aid services and waiver of court fees, and
through the introduction of special services in family courts, which are of high priority for poor communities. These
initiatives are achieving mixed results, and services remain weak and underutilized.
The main objective of this event is to provide a space for dialogue offering participants an environment within which
to share knowledge and expertise and to be exposed to experience from other settings, notably Europe. By offering a
space for government officials, representatives of civil society organizations, practitioners, academics and members of
international development organizations to openly discuss issues related to their work, the event seeks to inspire and
develop ideas for improving services and institutions, and identify key areas for prioritized technical assistance,
including knowledge gaps to be addressed to inform policy development.
Such discussions will be expected to provide guidance to CMI as the Center is launching an ‘Open Government
Initiatives’ program, aimed at supporting open government reforms that promote greater transparency and
accountability of government operations, and enhance the delivery of justice sector services.

Executive Summary

Although still low, Cameroon’s rural electrification rate has risen significantly, from around
11 percent in 2000, to 18 percent in 2012.
Since 2001, a concession for the national electricity system has been used to extend
connections to over 190,000 rural households. The concession was for the vertically-
integrated and formerly state-owned national utility, SONEL. From 2001 to 2014, this
concession was held by AES SONEL. After 2014 ownership transferred to ENEO. These
concessions have been the main driver of Cameroon’s electrification.
History: In 1998, the Government of Cameroon passed the Electricity Law. This law
established an electricity sector regulator and a rural electrification agency. It was designed to
attract private sector participation. In 2001 the Government privatized the state-owned
electric utility SONEL through a 20-year concession to the American power company AES.
AES SONEL was granted a monopoly over transmission and distribution and the right to
own up to 1,000MW of generation capacity. In 2014, AES sold its stake in AES SONEL to
Actis. The company was renamed ENEO.
ENEO: ENEO (formerly known as AES SONEL) has achieved over 500,000 new
connections since entering private hands. The concession agreement obligates ENEO to
connect new customers—the concessionaire originally met this obligation by focusing on
urban and peri-urban areas, to the detriment of rural areas. However, over time specific
regional access targets were set. The Government of Cameroon and donors finance grid
extension projects and then transfer them to ENEO, thereby extending ENEO’s service
perimeter. Today, around 35 percent of ENEO’s one million connections are in rural areas.
Challenges: The concession has not been without its challenges. The concession contract
has been reopened for negotiations at least three times since 2001–first in 2006, then in
2011, and most recently in 2015. A continuing challenge is the relatively high tariffs charged
by ENEO. In 2011, the Government opted to freeze tariffs and to directly compensate the
concessionaire.
New Directions: Going forward, the Government continues to finance and build new grid
extensions with the intent to transfer them to ENEO. The Government has also been trying,
mostly unsuccessfully, to attract private sector participation in projects outside the ENEO
concession area.
Key Lessons:
The concession illustrates lessons for governments considering using a concession approach
to rural electrification:
         National utility concessions can be powerful agents for change
         Grid extension can be implemented and financed by a combination of private
          enterprises, public actors and donors.

1      Introduction
The purpose of this report is to review Cameroon’s experience with rural electrification
concessions. Since 2001, a private entity has held a concession to operate the state-owned
national electricity system. Cameroon has also unsuccessfully tried to implement smaller
concessions in rural areas. This case study is one of six detailed case studies that form a body
of evidence on the experience and successes of rural electrification concessions across sub-
Saharan Africa.
Background on the Cameroon power system and its approach to rural electrification is
presented in Section 2. The implementation of the concession for the national utility—
ENEO (formerly known as AES SONEL)—is reviewed in detail in Section 3. The report
concludes with an assessment of the concession model in Cameroon in Section 4.

To put Cameroon’s rural electrification concessions in context, we first present the historical,
economic and political context. Reference statistics for Cameroon are presented below.

Economy and demographics
Cameroon is a country of 22.8 million people with annual GDP per capita of US$1,426.
Over the last 20 years, population has grown at 2.55 percent per year and GDP per capita (in
real PPP terms) has grown at 1.08 percent per year.
Politics and governance
Cameroon is a former colony which gained independence from France in 1960 and was
joined by British-controlled Northern Cameroon in 1961. The country has been ruled by one
president, Paul Biya, and his Rassemblement Démocratique du Peuple Camerounais (RDPC)
party (formerly called Union Nationale Camerounaise-UNC) since 1982. UNC was the only
legal political party until 1990, when multi-party democracy was introduced. Transparency
International’s corruption perceptions index ranks Cameroon very poorly at 158 out of 175
countries. The legal system is based on both civil and common law: Common law operates
in the two Anglophone regions (North West and South West) and civil law operates in the
eight francophone regions (Adamaoua, Centre, East, Far North, Littoral, North, West and
South). These systems of law expanded to Cameroon through colonization by conquest. The
administrative tradition is French and English.
The security and humanitarian situation in Cameroon has been mixed. Cameroon was
classified by the World Bank as a fragile or conflict-affected state (FCS) in 4 of the 12 years
between 2001 and 2012.1 In 2013, the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank
found that:
           “Cameroon shares some of the characteristics of fragile and conflict-affected states (FCS) including a
           conflict-affected neighborhood; the nontransparent use of revenues from its huge natural resource
           endowment; a dominant ruling party; an unwieldy, centralized government, delivering services poorly
           and unequally to its people; and increasing unemployment, particularly among the youth?.2
2.1        Power Market Structure and Evolution
The current structure and legal framework of the electricity sector in Cameroon results from
the successive reforms of 1998 and 2011.
The 1998 Electricity Law3 preceded a complementary Electricity Decree in 2000.4 These laws
enabled the liberalization and privatization of SONEL, the state-owned power utility. In
2001, AES purchased a 56 percent share of SONEL, creating AES SONEL. As part of the
privatization, AES SONEL and the Cameroon state signed a concession agreement. In 2014,
AES sold its interest in AES SONEL to Actis. The company was renamed ENEO
Cameroon.
ENEO Cameroun operates three distinct grids:

Other Important Electricity Sector Actors
Other than ENEO, the main entities in the power sector in Cameroon include:
         Ministry of Energy and Water (Ministère de l’Eau et de l’Energie, MINEE):
          The MINEE is responsible for implementing government action in the energy
          sector and monitoring energy sector activities
            Rural Electrification Agency (Agence d’Electrification Rurale–AER): AER
             promotes and develops rural electrification projects across the country by
             providing financing to communities and operators. AER is a public institution
             established by Decree in 1999.5 AER is under the technical authority of the
             MINEE and the financial supervision of the Minister of Finance.6 In 2013, a
             Decree of the President of the Republic reinforced the AER mission7. AER’s
             tasks and responsibilities were identified more precisely in the decree’s section on
             rural electrification.
            Rural Energy Fund (Rurale Énergie Fund–FER): FER was created by
             presidential decree in 2009. It is not a legal entity and is managed by AER. The
             main purpose of FER is to grant a partial subsidy to priority investment programs
             involving rural electrification.
            Electric Sector Regulation Agency (Agence de Régulation du Secteur de
             l’Electricité–ARSEL): ARSEL was established by the 1998 Electricity Law
             governing the electricity sector.8 ARSEL regulates the electricity sector. its
             principal tasks are to:
               – monitor the sector's activity
               – approve tariffs and determine electrical standards
               – examine concession and license applications
               – authorize electricity generation and distribution
               – protect consumers; and
               – promote competition and facilitate private sector involvement in the sector.
            Electricity Development Corporation (EDC): EDC is a state-owned company
             created by decree9 that develops the electricity sector including all hydroelectric
             projects in the country. EDC is mainly in charge of building and operating of
             dams as well as operation and maintenance of storage dams (barrage-réservoirs).
             The purposes of EDC are to:
               – manage, on behalf of the State, public assets in the electricity sector;
               – study, prepare or implement any infrastructure project in the electricity sector
                 assigned by the State
               – promote and develop public and private investment in the electricity sector.

         by presidential decree in 2009. The committee’s main purpose is to ensure the
         proper allocation of resources and subsidies administered by the FER. The
         COPPER is chaired by the Minister of Water and Energy.

2.2    Rural Electrification Approach
Under the new 2011 Electricity Law, similar to the 1998 Electricity Law, rural electrification
projects are governed by a regime of licenses and authorization distinct from the main
concession. ARSEL is the granting authority for these license, not the Minister upon the
regulator’s recommendation as is common elsewhere in Cameroon’s power sector.
Distribution projects in rural areas with capacity below 1MW can be granted authorizations
by ARSEL; there is no requirement for an international call for bids.
In addition, the 2011 Electricity Law provides for specific provisions related to renewable
energy, which are particularly relevant for rural electrification. The law:
.
            Specifies the term “renewable energy,? including: solar and photovoltaic energy,
             wind power; hydro power, biomass energy regardless of capacity, geothermal
             energy and marine origin energy;
            Increases the threshold of exploitable river-based hydro power to 5MW;
            Requires electric utility operators to connect any renewable energy producer (who
             applies) to the grid. Connection costs shall be paid by the applicant;
            Promises the establishment of an agency responsible for the promotion and
             development of renewable energy;
            Clarifies by regulation the terms under which renewable energy purchases will be
             made by the public service operator, including the volume and price of said
             purchases (feed-in tariff).
The rural electrification approach in Cameroon is electrification through grid extension. The
government finances these extensions and hands off newly electrified areas to the national
concessionaire ENEO.
The ENEO concession’s primary responsibility is not rural electrification. The 2001
concession agreement did set global objectives for extending electricity access in rural areas,
but this is no longer the case. Instead, ENEO’s electricity access objectives are broken down
by region. ENEO participates in electrification of rural areas through the extension of its
grid and the operation of 26 small (from 250kW to 1MW) diesel power plants. The number
of clients in rural areas is estimated at 35 percent of the total number of subscribers (that is,
about 350,000).10
According to the Electricity Law, the MINEE is responsible for establishing and updating an
annual rural energy program (Programme Annuel d’Energie Rurale–PAER).
Responsibility for rural electrification in the country lies in principle with AER, which
manages (in conjunction with relevant entities):
            Contributing to the elaboration and implementation of Government policy in the
             domain of rural electrification
            Conducting surveys and studies with a view to providing technical and economic
             solutions for rural electrification
            Assisting rural communities and operators to prepare for rollout of rural
             electrification projects.
AER has tried to develop competitive bidding programs for concession in rural areas.
However, these programs have not yet started, for various reasons. When the first
concession programs were designed, no financing was available to provide the proposed
subsidies to attract private operators to rural areas.

AER in order to mobilize financing and grant subsidies to eligible projects. Its management
was appointed in June 2011.
Currently AER mainly contributes to rural electrification by implementing grid extension
projects financed by donors, which are then transferred to ENEO.
Private Sector Participation Outside the ENEO Concession
In 2012, a zonal concession program with 3 zones was designed by a consultant working as
part of the World Bank PDSEN project (Projet de Développement de l’Energie Rurale).
However, the concession program was not implemented due to poor preparation, the risk of
available funding expiring, and the Government’s desires to use a faster method of
increasing access. Instead, the World Bank PDSEN project was redirected towards a grid
extension project to be implemented by AER (Projets d’Electrification Rurale Par Extension
Des Reseaux Interconnectés Nord et Sud–PERENNIS).
AER is supposed to promote Local Initiative Projects for Rural Energy (Projets d’Initiative
Locale d’Energie Rurale–PILER) by launching one or two calls for projects per year. PILER
projects can benefit from subsidies from the FER to cover up to 80 percent of the costs of
studies and 70 percent of the investment costs of the project.
The PILER local initiative projects have failed to develop. This failure may be explained by
the following reasons:
             The sale of electricity by small private operators of grid extension projects are not
              cost competitive with the low, equalized ENEO tariff. Similarly, decentralized
              production can compete with the national ENEO tariff only in rare circumstances
              (for instance, in remote areas with econ hydropower plants).
             Private promoters struggle to overcome administrative red tape. Promoters cite
              receiving little support from AER to prepare feasibility studies or to respond to
              permit applications to obtain permits.11An example is given by the Mbakaou
              project, which includes a hydroelectric power plant of 1.22MW and its associated
              electrical grid of approximately 70km of low and medium voltage network to
              connect 2800 subscribers across eight locations. The first application to ARSEL
              for a provisional authorization was made in 2009, the land attributed in 2011 and,
              the final ARSEL approval obtained in February 2015.12
Cameroon has large potential for decentralized hydropower and biofuel power plants. An
EU project monitored by ARSEL called “Investelec? has identified 100 sites showing
potential for installing power production. AER is now hoping to facilitate initiatives in this
area by relaxing administrative requirements, strengthening AER’s capacities to support
promoters, and preparing standard documents (including power purchase agreements in
cooperation with ENEO and standard arrangements for accessing the grid).

Building publicly financed grid extensions
Several other public institutions other than AER participate in rural electrification projects
financed through public aid. Occasionally these entities lack competence or are otherwise
uncoordinated in their efforts. FEICOM, The Special Fund for Equipment and Mutual
Assistance (Fonds Spécial d’Equipement et d’Intervention Intercommunale), was created in
197413 and supports regional and local authorities in their development process including the
development of electricity grid extensions in conjunction with AER. This seems to be a
good example of cooperation.
The EDC’s efforts in grid extension are more controversial. Its managerial and technical
experience is in managing hydro plant assets. However, it has undertaken rural electrification
projects. Constructing grid extension projects seems remote from the main purpose of the
company and the technical skills of its personnel. Its rural electrification efforts are
performed without coordination between other relevant bodies and the AER in particular.14

3           The ENEO Concession
In July 2001, AES Corporation acquired a 56 percent stake in state-owned power utility
company Société Nationale d’Electricité (SONEL) and entered into a 20-year concession to
generate, transmit and distribute electricity in Cameroon. The government’s objectives for
the SONEL concession were:
             To promote effectiveness and efficient operation of the power sector
             To increase private sector participation in the power sector
In June 2014 Actis acquired from AES the 56 percent interest in AES SONEL, renamed
ENEO (for Energy of Cameroon) in September 201415. In accordance with the provisions
governing the privatization, 5 percent of the share capital should be transferred to the
employees. ENEO has over 973,250 customers of which approximately 45 percent live in
the cities of Douala and Yaoundé.
ENEO has presented an investment program amounting to XOF421 billion by 2024 and
XOF902 billion by 2031, that implies that the term of the concession–which is supposed to
end in 2021–would be extended.
3.1         Stages of Development
The concession began operations in 2001. A timeline showing the major stages of
development around the concession is presented in Table 3.1.

3.2         Operations and Management
The concessionaire has adequate capacity to operate and manage the concession.
We met ENEO managers in Douala. They are competent and have experience managing
similar electricity sector assets. Several of the managers formerly worked at the main Uganda
concession, Umeme.
Actis is very involved in the management and strategic direction of ENEO and the
concession’s ongoing contract negotiations.
3.3         Financing Arrangements
ENEO’s capital funding strategy relies on private, public and donor money.
AES paid US$71 million to the Government of Cameroon to acquire a 56 percent stake in
SONEL. IFC was Cameroon’s lead advisor on the transaction.16 AES sold its 56 percent
stake in SONEL to Actis for US$220 million (or about CFAF110 billion).17 The utility was
concessioned via an international public tender. Five consortia pre-qualified, but two of the
five withdrew before bidding was launched. The Government made the deal more attractive
to potential investors by guaranteeing 50 percent of the purchase price against a number of
risks including:
             Accuracy of financial accounting data
             The net book value of shareholders’ equity
             Accuracy of asset lists.
AES Corporation was the only company to submit a bid that met the technical and financial
requirements.

     tribune.com/?p=331 (accessed 7 October 2015).
In terms of donor money, AES SONEL received €240 million in loans from a group of
development finance institutions in 2006 to support its investment plans.18 IFC provided a
corporate loan of up to €70 million as part of that package.19 15.7 percent of this came from
the African Development Fund (ADF).20
Revenues are generated through cost-reflective tariffs, which have been the subject of
recurrent negotiations between the State of Cameroon and AES (later Actis) several times. In
addition, ENEO also has access to government and donor subsidies for new connections for
customers farther from distribution lines.
ENEO currently receives subsidies from the Government of Cameroon to compensate for
not applying the revised tariff approved in accordance with the concession (see section 3.6
below).
3.4         Contractual Arrangements
The 2001 concession agreement between the Republic of Cameroon and AES SONEL
covers a 20-year period. The first three years constituted a grace period to permit resolution
of any issues arising from the privatization.21
In 2004, the Cameroonian Government and AES SONEL started renegotiations around the
concession contract. The issues included in this renegotiation process are: service quality
requirements, connection targets, tariff formulation, the obligation to develop new
generation capacity, and the penalties regime.22
AES SONEL and the State of Cameroon have entered into four concession agreements,
relating respectively to agreements for the concession’s framework, electricity production,
transmission, distribution and licensing for the sale of electricity.
These concessions and license have been amended in December 2006 in view, in particular
to provide for:
             A reduction in of the cost of a connection, which was considered as an obstacle
              to the development of electricity access for households (before SONEL
              privatization, users did not pay for connections) and a provision for payment
              facilities for subscribers
             A revision of the objectives set forth in 2001 in replacing the breakdown of these
              objectives by size of cities (large cities, medium cities and rural areas) by a
              breakdown by regions; the global objective set to ENEO would be 70,000 new
              connections per year.
In 2012, AES SONEL and the Ministry of Energy and Water started a process of "re-
reading" the concession contracts to assess their compliance with the Electricity Law of 2011

and with the new tariff principles.This process led to the signing in December 2013 of a
Protocol summarizing the principles of agreements between the Parties, to be formalized in
an amendment to the concessions. A second amendment to the concessions was signed on 7
August 2015 between ENEO and the Government of Cameroon on the basis of these
principles. This amendment includes provisions for:
             The rehabilitation of the Song Loulou dam
             The transfer of storage dams to EDC (as already provided for by amendment n°1
              signed in 2006)
             The transfer of the activity of transmission and management of the transmission
              grid to a Transmission System Operator, Société nationale de transport
              d’électricité – Sonatrel, established by a Decree dated 8 October 2015
             The definition of new service quality standards and new indices for measuring the
              quality of service and the design of an appropriate tool to identify and track the
              link between the level of investment and the maintenance and service quality
              standards, together with the investments required, to be submitted for approval to
              ARSEL
             Connecting objectives, which are broken down by region and should now be
              included in the annual business plan submitted to ARSEL together with a detailed
              report on the implementation of new connections
             Update of the tariff formula and the possibility to implement a multi-year tariff
              increase mechanism, which will replace the current mechanism of annual increase.
3.5         Technological Approach
ENEO is a national vertically-integrated utility that operates the majority of the generation,
transmission and distribution systems in the country. ENEO manages three separate grids.
New connections are achieved primarily through grid extensions. However, ENEO has also
deployed independent 26 diesel generators for mini-grids in certain parts of the country. The
production costs of electricity from these generators is approximately the double than the
equalized tariff applied (170 CFA Francs/kWh).23
Until recently, ENEO had an installed production capacity of 999MW, with 39 production
plants, of which 13 are interconnected and 26 are small isolated power stations. Seventy-four
percent of production is from hydraulic sources. In September 2015, Actis sold its stakes in
two large thermal generators with a combined capacity of 302MW for US$227 million
(XOF125 billion).24
The transmission network connects 24 stations and includes 1944.29km of high voltage
lines, 15,081.48km of medium voltage lines and 15,209.25km of low voltage lines. The
distribution network consists of 11,450km of lines from 5.5kV to 33kV, and 11,158km of
lines of 220kV to 380kV.

3.6         Regulatory Arrangements
Tariffs are set by the MINEE upon ARSEL’s recommendation.
Both the concession and license provide terms and conditions of periodic modifications of
the tariff. The tariffs are in any case reviewed every five years, or in the event of any material
changes which substantially affect the economic, financial and technical environment in
which the contracts had been granted.25
ENEO’s electricity tariff is equalized and applicable countrywide. It may be revised annually
on the basis of a revenue cap formula. The tariff which currently applies has been set in
2012, as follows regarding low voltage. Since 2012, the electricity tariffs applicable by AES
SONEL are fixed as follows:

AES SONEL and ENEO have presented requests for revising the tariff to the Regulator.
The Government has decided to compensate the concessionaire for the amount of the
approved increase instead of revising the tariff. Compensations paid in this respect are as
follows:

4           Assessment of Concession
4.1         Evaluating Success of Concession
The ENEO concession has been considered relatively successful in terms of increasing
access in Cameroon, improving service quality, and making the utility financially sustainable.
4.1.1 Access
Since 2001, ENEO has extended around 570,000 household connections since 2001.
190,000 of these connections are with rural households.
When AES SONEL took over SONEL in 2001, the company had 427,000 customers.26 The
concession agreement obligated AES SONEL to add at least 50,000 connections per year. 27
However, during the first five years, AES SONEL fell short of this obligation, adding only
about 20,000 connections per year on average. In 2006, the company nonetheless expected
to “add approximately 750,000 new electricity connections throughout the country by 2021
by adding approximately 50,000 new electricity connections each year over the next 15
years?.28
In 2012, AES SONEL reported having 780,000 customers.29 This implies an increase in
353,000 customers between 2001 and 2012. Most new customers were the result of grid
densification, as opposed to grid expansion.
ENEO’s most recent official figures list 973,250 customers, of which approximately 45
percent live in the cities of Douala and Yaoundé. A company representative said they
expected ENEO to reach 1 million customers by the end of September 2015.
4.1.2 Quality of service
The quality of service from the concession has been mixed.
In its first years, the concession did not significantly improve service quality.30 This was partly
attributed to a lack of capacity at the sector regulator ARSEL.
4.1.3 Sustainability
In our assessment, the concession is relatively financially sustainable. The 56 percent equity
stake in the company has increased in value from US$71 million to US$220 million between
2001 and 2014.

29   CFAF 40 billion to export electricity to Nigeria (22 August 2012) in Business in Cameroon
30   World Bank, “Cameroon Energy Sector Development Project,? Project Appraisal Document, 29 May 2008.
The concession has not been recovering its costs since 2010 as a result of the tariff freeze.
Instead the Government has been subsidizing the company. However, in our assessment this
is due to political reasons rather than economic reasons.
4.2    Arrangements that Could Have Delivered Better Results
Ex-post, we can say that alternative arrangements would have delivered better results. We
would improve this arrangement by doing the following:
        Coordinating grid extension efforts. Construction of publicly financed grid
         extension would have been more efficient if made in a more coordinated manner.
        Improving capacity at AER and FER. Expansion of distribution may have
         been more successful if appropriate measures were taken to enable the AER and
         FER to meet the expectations set in policy. Specifically, these measures include:
         coordinating with publicly funded grid extension efforts; establishing the FER
         earlier; and strengthening AER’s capacity to provide assistance to private
         promoters. AER could have facilitated AES SONEL/ENEO power purchase
         conditions and conditions for accessing the grid. AER could have also prepared
         standard documents, cut some administrative red tape, and coordinated more
         with ARSEL.
4.3    Reasons for Results
The success of the concession can be explained by the following key factors:
        There was a political commitment to making the concession work
        ENEO and the Government of Cameroon were successfully able to renegotiate
         and adapt to unforeseen changes in the sector and the economic environment.
4.4    Replicability of Experience and Success
The concession model used in Cameroon and its success can be replicated elsewhere in
Africa. Cameroon remains one of the poorest countries in the world and a difficult place to
do business. Despite these challenges, the concession was generally successfully at putting
the concession on solid footing. A commitment on the part of the Government of
Cameroon to make the concession work appears to be a key success factor.
4.5    Lessons for Future Concessions
The concession illustrates lessons for governments considering using a concession approach
to rural electrification:
        National utility concessions can be powerful agents for change. The ENEO
         concession added almost 600,000 connections between 2001 and 2015.
        Grid extension can be financed by a combination of private, public and
         donor funding. A range of different actors and financing sources in Cameroon
         are contributing to ENEO’s grid extension efforts.

                                          PREFACE


These guidelines are directed to the economic analysis of power sector policy analysis and the
appraisal of power sector investment projects. The general guidance is complemented by an
Annex Volume that contains relevant technical notes, a glossary, and an extended
Bibliography.

In this first edition, the focus of the technical notes is on grid-connected renewable energy
projects. In FY16 the scope of the technical notes will be extended to cover transmission &
distribution, rural electrification, off-grid, energy efficiency, and thermal projects.

1.        INTRODUCTION

____________________________________________________________________________________

1.     In June 2013 the Bank issued new guidelines for the economic analysis of projects.1
These guidelines explain the revised approach to economic analysis introduced in the April
2013 version of BP10.00: Investment Project Financing. These require three questions be
answered of all projects:
     1.   What is the project’s development impact? This is the traditional question underlying
          the Bank’s approach to cost-benefit analysis. It requires careful consideration of the
          expected stream of project benefits and costs, grounded in an explicit causal
          framework linking project activities to targeted outcomes.
     2.   Is public sector provision or financing the appropriate vehicle? This question probes
          the rationale for public involvement with respect to financing and/or implementation
          and should explicitly consider alternative modes of provision.
     3.   What is the World Bank’s value added? This question examines the World Bank’s
          contribution to the project. It seeks to determine the benefit from Bank staff
          involvement and whether the proposed project maximizes the development impact of
          staff effort.

2.      Moreover, the new guidelines stress the importance of deciding already at the PCN
stage on the form and content of the economic analysis that the team will undertake during
preparation, necessitating advance thinking about economic analysis prior to the Project
Concept Note (PCN) meeting. Economic analysis, and economic reasoning, should assist in the
choice and design of projects, rather than simply serving as a final quality check at the late
stages of Project Appraisal Document preparation.

3.       The OPSPQ guidelines apply to the analysis of all investment projects financed by the
World Bank, and are necessarily general. They set out in some detail the rationale for the new
approach, and how economic analysis should be used to help the design of a project. The
guidelines provide general advice in setting out the form and content of an economic analysis
as listed in Table 1.1: for each point we note the relevant issues for the typical energy project –
a more detailed discussion of which is provided in Section 2.

4.      In short, the OPSPQ guidelines describe what is to be done in an economic analysis for
a bank-funded project, and why it should be done: the guidelines for economic analysis set out
here focus on how it is to be done in the specific case of power sector projects.

power sector projects, which need to be consulted to guide certain aspects of CBA for power
sector projects and policy analysis:

SCOPE AND FORM OF THE ANALYSIS
8.      The scope and form of an economic & financial analysis should be adjusted to the main
categories of project:
    Large greenfield projects, often $500 million and more, often involving other major IFIs, with
     typically large project preparation budgets, and often with comprehensive feasibility studies
     completed: most large generation and high voltage transmission projects fall into this category.3 The
     sheer scale of such projects generally warrant application of the full set of economic analysis tools
     described in these Guidelines..


3        Among renewable energy projects, typical examples in this category include the Morocco CSP Project (World
         Bank Report-4663-MA) and the Tarbela Hydro extension project (Bank Report 60963-PK).
September 2015                                                                                                 4
   Portfolio projects often involving client country financial intermediaries, that may enable a wide
    range of renewable energy or energy efficiency technologies and projects implemented by the private
    sector, sometimes with many subprojects, each of which may be individually quite small. At the time
    of project appraisal, the economic analysis is necessarily limited to the evaluation of a sample of
    potential sub-projects (or subprojects identified in the pipeline for implementation in the first year of
    the project). Typical examples include the Turkey Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy
    Efficiency Project; the Vietnam Renewable Energy Development Project or the Uganda Energy for
    Rural Transformation project. Many of the Bank’s transmission and distribution projects also involve
    large number of subprojects only some of which are in the project pipeline at time of project
    preparation. Part of the economist’s role during project preparation is to set out the scope and form
    of economic analysis required during project implementation, typically implemented by project
    management units (PMUs).
   Smaller projects and rehabilitation projects: while these may well require a more limited analysis,
    one should avoid the presumption that the economic analysis of small projects requires little serious
    attention. It is always difficult to set minimum thresholds for satisfactory analysis, but the
    spreadsheet snapshots provided in the Annex Volume provide guidance on what is minimally
    required for smaller projects.
   Policy analysis: The Bank is increasingly involved in assisting its clients with power sector policy
    reforms, which invariably requires economic reasoning to ensure rational results. Many of the tools
    and techniques provided in the technical notes provide support for this kind of project, which often
    requires illustrative examples of the impact of reforms on the various stakeholders and of the
    financial and macroeconomic consequences (particularly in the demonstration of the economic costs
    and targeting performance of fuel subsidies, and the economic costs of non-technical and revenue
    collection losses in T&D projects).
   Small projects in small countries, in many cases associated with emergency projects requiring
    immediate implementation.4 For such projects the economic and financial analysis can be limited in
    scope, for the economic benefits of restoring power supply are so large that much detailed study may
    be deemed superfluous. But that does not mean a basic economic risk assessment is unnecessary:
    there are a number of examples of emergency power projects that have ended up as white elephants,5
    which might have been avoided had there been even a simple risk assessment-based scenario
    analysis.

9.       Just as economic analysis as set out in the new OPSPQ guidelines reflects an iterative
role in the project definition and project preparation cycle, so is the analytical process an
iterative one. An economic analysis is rarely conducted as a one-time pass through a set of
proscribed steps, seriatim. Typically the economic analysis starts with a quick first pass
through all the steps in Figure 2.1, using whatever data as may be conveniently at hand, mainly
as a way of identifying data gaps: placeholders based on the experience of the analyst are often
indispensable. As noted by the OPSPQ guidelines, a first estimate of the economic returns
should already be prepared even before the PCN stage.

10.      Often such a first pass will reveal economic returns that are too good to be true, or so
low that their acceptance implies abandonment of the project as proposed. In the first case the
economist’s role is to bring realism to the table, in the second case it is to force attention to
revised project designs or consideration of alternatives better suited to achieving the project
objectives. There are many examples of seemingly good renewable energy projects (say a wind
project to replace diesel generation on a very windy island) but which on closer examination of
the realisable economic benefits prove to be at best marginal because the load is insufficient; or
because the load curve is such that night-time wind production cannot be absorbed (even with



4       Such as the Afghanistan Emergency Power Project (that included rehabilitation of the Naghlu hydro project)
        and the Burundi Emergency Power Project that included small hydro development (World Bank Report
        56454-BI)
5       For example, the 110 MW diesel power station constructed in 2008 by USAID on an emergency basis at
        Tarakhil, outside Kabul has almost never been used – in part because of problems of reliable supply of diesel
        fuel, in part because diesel fuel has been prohibitively expensive, and in part because relatively abundant
        imports of surplus power for Uzbekistan have been available at low cost. Such outcomes could easily have
        been anticipated in 2007/2008.
September 2015                                                                                                    5
time-of-day tariffs to encourage night time use such as for ice-making for fishermen); or
because of the part-load inefficiency of diesels.

11.     As the preparation of the economic analysis Annex to the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) proceeds, it may be useful to evaluate its content against the Checklist of Table 2.1.
Many of the questions apply to all projects: others are specific to particular types of projects.
One may note that the answer to all of these questions is not necessarily “yes? – but whenever
the answer is “no?, then there should be a plausible answer as to why not.

12.     The Technical Notes are organised in three sections:
       Basic Concepts: applicable to all power sector projects (C1 to C8)
       Technology related issues: In this first version of the guidelines, these relate just to
        renewable energy projects (T1 to T5). Subsequent versions will add additional notes
        on other types of power sector investment and policy projects.
     Methodologies and techniques: providing guidance on specific techniques useful for
        economic analysis of power projects (such as Monte Carlo simulation, estimating
        demand curves, and mean-variance portfolio analysis). (M1 to M9).
Each technical note provides a subject oriented reading list, supplemented by a Master
Bibliography in Annex A1.

POLICY ANALYSIS AND PROJECT APPRAISAL
13.      Although the emphasis of this Guidance is directed at the appraisal of investment
projects, the principles of economic reasoning apply to other types of projects encountered in
the Energy & Extractives Global Practice. The Bank is increasingly being asked to provide
assistance to client Governments in formulating an improved policy environment to enable
private investment in the sector, and to provide development policy credits and loans
expressly tied to power sector reform. Moreover, the sustainability of investment projects is
often largely determined by the policy environment, and therefore the policy review (Step 2 of
Figure 2.1) must necessarily encompass a much broader canvas than just the details of a
particular proposed project. For this reason the Technical Notes include exposition of tools
relevant as much to policy evaluation as to project appraisal. 6 Table 2.2 summarises the main
applications.

Investment Project Appraisal     The main steps of which are outlined in Figure 2.1. A review of the
                                 policy background must necessarily precede consideration of a specific
                                 project.
Development Policy               These are typically tied to power sector reforms, and premised on a set of
Credit/Loan                      prior actions and policy reforms, whose economic and environmental
                                 impacts must be evaluated in the PAD. The analysis and evaluation of
                                 these prior actions rests largely on the same techniques as those presented
                                 in these Guidelines.
Technical Assistance for         Typical projects include assistance in drafting renewable energy tariffs (as
improving the policy             in Vietnam), or in improving regulation and reducing subsidies (such as
environment                      the introduction of performance based regulation to PLN in Indonesia),
                                 which provide the necessary enabling environment for larger investment
                                 projects in the sector. See Annex I (Additional Guidance for Renewable
                                 Energy Projects, Step 2) for a summary of the policy issues germane to
                                 renewable energy.

         and the design renewable energy support tariffs based on benefits.

3.      THE STEPS OF A PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
______________________________________________________________________________



1.      THE RATIONALE
14.     The OPSPQ economic analysis guidelines call for the early involvement of the project
economist, whose first task is a quick reality check with whatever cost and benefit data as may
be at hand. How likely is the project to meet the required hurdle rate? What are the main data
gaps that need immediate clarification? And, especially important in the case of renewable
energy projects, what are the seasonal and daily patterns of the renewable energy resource in
question, for this will be one of the key determinants of potential benefits.

15.     A presentation of the energy sector background is required of all PADs, which
generally develops the rationale for the proposed investment project or policy intervention.
However, clarity of objectives – that will largely determine the shape, form, and content of an
economic analysis – is not always assured. For example, some recent proposed T&D projects
have included a component to introduce smart meters – but upon closer inspection, some of the
benefits demonstrated in developed countries (replace expensive manual meter reading) or
even in some developing countries (reduce very high non-technical and commercial losses - i.e.
pilferage - such as in India and Pakistan) do not really apply to other countries (for instance in
Vietnam, where both pilferage rates and labour costs are low).7 In the case of grid connected
renewable energy projects with high incremental costs, the importance of a clearly defined
rationale is paramount.

16.      “Least cost? deserves careful definition. Many utilities claim to use least cost planning
models which upon close inspection means least financial cost to the utility. The term as used in
these Guidelines means least economic cost including all local externalities, from the perspective
of the country. Global externalities (principally the damage costs of GHG emissions) should
always be considered separately in a CBA, because their impact is critically dependent upon
the valuation of the social cost of carbon, and because many of the Bank’s low and middle
income client Governments disagree that this should influence their investment decisions -
particularly when the valuation as proposed by the new World Bank guidance document on
the social cost of carbon is much higher than the developed countries’ own willingness-to-pay
for carbon reductions (as evidenced by the current value in global carbon markets such as the
EU ETS).

17.       The view taken in these Guidelines is that whatever carbon reduction targets as may be
set by Governments as a matter of policy, the task of the economic analysis is to ensure that this
target is achieved at least economic (social) cost. For example, the decision of the Government
of Indonesia to include in the evaluation of benefits of geothermal energy at $30/ton CO2
valuation for GHG emissions was essentially a political decision:8 the task of the economist is to
insist that this value applies equally to all renewable energy technologies (and their support
tariffs, and indeed to all power sector projects), and that the relevant question is how to meet
carbon reductions at least economic cost – which may well mean that energy efficiency or
thermal generation or distribution system rehabilitation should be preferred over some high
cost renewable energy projects. The extent to which so-called learning curve benefits accrue to
the countries now embarking on high cost renewable projects (as in the case of the CSP projects
in Morocco) is particularly contentious (and is discussed in Technical Note T3).

7       See M. Madrigal and R. Uluski, Practical Guidance for Defining a Smart Grid Modernization Strategy: the Case of
        Distribution. World Bank Study, 2015.
8       It could be argued that this is not a political decision at all, but that $30/ton (or more) simply reflects the
        reality of global damage costs. But that ignores the other reality that it is the rich countries that are largely
        responsible for the GHG emissions problem, who became wealthy as a consequence of abundant low cost
        fossil energy, and that it is profoundly unfair to burden poor countries (and their consumers) with the cost of
        mitigation (particularly at a time when the carbon markets of the rich countries value carbon at $10/ton
        CO2).
September 2015                                                                                                        8
2.      POLICY REVIEW
18.     Both OPSPQ and the Energy Directions Paper 9 stress the importance of the policy
framework that will ultimately determine the sustainability of a proposed project. The main
policy questions to be resolved for a project appraisal are as follows: is the policy (and tariff)
environment
   Transparent: Bankability of project PPAs depends on the principles and calculation
    methodology of tariffs being understood by the various stakeholders. In the case of
    renewable energy projects, is there clarity about how the incremental costs are recovered?
   Equitable: Many subsidies on electricity and fuels are poorly targeted, with a
    disproportionate share captured by the better off income groups (i.e., they are poorly
    targeted).10
   Sustainable: Projects that rely upon tariff subsidies, or on thermal fuel subsidies, may not
    be sustainable, because the burdens of subsidies may themselves be unsustainable (and
    subject to rapid change). Renewable energy projects that depend on recovery of
    incremental costs from some “Fund? will be at risk if the funding of that “Fund? cannot be
    assured.
   Efficient: Access to feed-in tariffs for renewable energy under first-come first served
    arrangements does not assure economic efficiency: unless transaction costs outweigh the
    benefits (which may be the case for small projects), competitive mechanisms should be
    sought. Consumer tariffs should reflect the economic cost of supply (and are ideally based
    on the long term marginal costs of supply at each voltage level of consumption).


3.      METHODOLOGY
19.     With the rationale defined, one then identifies the main data requirements and the
methodology to be used. What are the main sources of information (e.g. utility capacity
expansion plan, a detailed feasibility study?) What is the approach for setting the counter-
factual? What externalities will be considered? What can be valued? What discount rate (or
range of discount rates) should be used and why? What subjects are worthy of separate
detailed assessment?

20.      OPSPQ mandates the use of CBA as the principal tool of economic analysis for project
appraisal, though with some latitude to use cost-effectiveness analysis – in which one may not
be able to monetize all anticipated benefits or the alternatives considered, 11 and simply makes
comparisons of costs of alternatives to deliver “roughly simila r bundles of outcomes and
benefits.? But where indeed there are project objectives beyond economic efficiency, so-called
multi-attribute decision analysis is a useful tool to illuminate the trade-offs among conflicting
objectives (Technical Note M6).

Beyond CBA
21.     The performance of long-term energy infrastructure projects is sensitive to future
changes in energy prices, energy demand, technological innovation and climate change.
Making these projects resilient to long-term changes is challenged by the irreducible
uncertainty that surrounds future climate change and socio-economic developments. This has
resulted in an increasing demand for new methodologies that take this uncertainty into account
during the economic analysis of projects, and which places more emphasis on robustness than
on claimed optimality.

22.       The traditional approach to power systems modelling (and the related preparation of
so-called “Masterplans?), and the conventional approach to CBA, fall under a decision -making
paradigm often described as “predict then act?. The presumption is that given some set of
assumptions about the future (load forecasts, international energy prices) one can identify an
“optimal? investment plan to meet the objective, with optimality defined as least economic cost
(or in the case of a project appraisal, choose that alternative with the highest NPV >0). In a
deterministic world, or one where most assumptions about the future were judged reasonably
certain (as they were in the years immediately following WW II when CBA evolved, i.e. before
the first oil crisis in 1973), this approach performed well.

23.      But with the increasing levels of uncertainty that characterise the modern world,
traditional CBA – even when accompanied by the ensemble of ancillary tools of sensitivity
analysis and Monte Carlo Risk assessment - has run into difficulties. First, there may be
disagreement about forecasts of the future, or the discount rate used to trade-off current and
future consumption and saving, so decisions may be stalled because of lack of consensus.
Second, if the predicted future does not materialize, then what was thought to be optimal
(“least-cost?) proves in reality to have been distinctly non-optimal. Moreover, many variables
are very difficult to forecast in probability terms (for example, how does one assign
probabilities to trajectories of future oil prices?)

24.       Several methodologies to address these problems are being proposed, referred to collectively as
Decision Making under Uncertainty (DMU). These start with a different approach, namely to ask
“Which investment option best meets our goals given that we cannot know what the future will bring?? 12
Such methods seek to identify robust decisions that satisfy decision makers’ objectives in many plausible
futures, rather than being optimal in any single best estimate of the future.13

25.      These various approaches are discussed further in Technical Note C4, and include:
  Robust decision-making: developed at the RAND corporation to inform policy choices under
    deep uncertainty and complexity (such as predicting the vulnerability of a project to future
    climate change impacts when there may even be disagreement about the validity of models
    that link outcomes to current actions).14 In the Bank literature, a good general introduction
    to RDM is Hallegatte and others. 15 RDM is being applied to several ongoing World Bank
    projects including power sector planning in Afghanistan, and hydropower investments in Nepal. 16
  Real options: long used in the private sector to assess resource exploration, marketing and
    investment decisions under uncertainties that may require additional time or money to resolve
    (discussed further in Step 12,below).
  Probabilistic Scenario Analysis: which derives the economic consequences of making non-optimal
    decisions, and highlights the relationship between the degree of risk-aversion of the decision-maker
    and the consequences of non-optimal choices (Technical Note C4 includes an example of setting
    targets for renewable energy).


4.      DATA
26.      In most cases, the main problem for the economist is not so much the technical and cost
details of the proposed project, but that of the counterfactual. For the proposed project,
detailed technical feasibility studies are often available, that present costs and performance
data in some detail – and, depending on the quality of the FS, also provide the rationale for the
particular project design alternatives considered (for example in a hydro project the dam axis,

reservoir size, powerhouse configuration, determination of turbine sizes). Rather, the problem
lies in the specification of the counter-factual, for which much less information is generally
available (often because the alternative has not been of great interest to the project proponent).

27.     One might have assumed that the Bank’s unique and wide experience with power
sector projects (surely many hundreds over the past decade) would have led to a database
repository of power project data across generation types, geography, equipment source, with
costs and technical performance. Unfortunately, this has not been the case thus far (though
with the introduction of the global practice on energy and extractives, one may hope this be
done at some point in the future). But for the time being, the project economist is generally left
to his own devices to assemble cost and performance data for the set of technologies of interest.
The main sources can be summarised as follows:
        Fossil fuel generation costs:     NREL is a source of good information not just on
         renewable energy, but also on the thermal generation alternatives as well. The Bank’s
         META tool contains data for a wide range of representative thermal technologies. The
         US Energy Information Administration (USEIA) website also provides good data of
         cost and performance of generation projects, but such generic estimates need care for
         application to developing countries (and often do not reflect the much lower costs of
         Chinese suppliers). Sadly, the EPRI Technical Assessment Guide that was for many
         years the standard reference in the US is no longer maintained.
        Renewable energy: the various reports by the International Renewable Energy Agency
         (IRENA) provide useful references for technology cost and performance trends The
         US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is another rich source of technical
         information. Some computer tools such as RETSCREEN and HOMER also include
         databases of valuable cost and technology information.
The main difficulty here is that especially in the case of renewable energy projects, costs are
highly site-specific (as in the case of large hydro costs), which generic estimates issued by
international agencies often do not reflect well. Technical Note C1 discusses data issues in
more detail: Table C1.7 presents an annotated list of sources that have proven useful.


5.       IDENTIFYING PROJECT COSTS
28.      Estimating the capital and O&M costs of power sector projects is generally
straightforward (albeit subject to the usual uncertainties of cost escalation and delay).
However, several topics require special attention:

The transparency of cost estimates
29.     The reconciliation of economic and financial costs needs to be transparent, clearly
identifying such financial costs as are excluded from the economic flows, and with a careful
breakdown of foreign and domestic costs, and what elements of costs are transfer costs to be
excluded from the economic flows. This is also an essential prerequisite for the distributional
analysis. A recommended format for the presentation of economic and financial costs is
presented in Table C1.12.

The opportunity cost of consumptive water use.
30.     Most CBAs encountered in PADs simply assume the equivalence of opportunity cost of
water with its financial cost (which only rarely reflects the true cost, particularly in arid
countries). Indeed in many cases, consumptive water use is not separated out from general
O&M costs.        The Medupi coal-fired generatoin project in South Africa illustrates the
importance of the need for a careful water balance. Even though the project uses dry cooling
(requiring relatively little make-up water compared to evaporative cooling), the FGD units to
be added later on are based on a wet process, requiring 11 million cubic metres of water per
year. Whether the financial price to ESKOM reflects the actual opportunity cost of water in an
arid part of the country is controversial: good practice demands that in all arid countries,

September 2015                                                                                11
consumptive water use and its economic cost be separately identified in the table of economic
flows.

31.     Consumptive water use is also required for some renewable energy projects (such as
the CSP project in Morocco). Any consumptive water use associated with the displaced
thermal generation should also be accounted for (and whose avoidance constitutes an
additional benefit of renewable energy generation).

32.      To establish a credible value for the economic cost of water may be difficult in the
absence of relevant detailed studies of the cost of developing municipal water supply or
irrigation. Whether such studies would need to be commissioned to support a CBA would
depend on a first round of sensitivity analysis – if an order of magnitude increase of the
financial water price (which generally is known) has a negligible impact on the economic
returns, more detailed study may not be necessary.

Shadow pricing of other inputs17
33.      A review of current World Bank practice shows that relatively few power sector project
appraisals have shadow-priced domestic (non-traded) inputs and outputs. However, in ADB
practice labour inputs are frequently shadow priced. 18 Whether this is really worth doing
depends on whether the adjustments are reasonably well grounded (there are few reliable
studies of the labour composition of renewable energy project construction work force), and
what proportion of the capital cost is imported equipment. With the exception of hydro (where
significant construction labour for civil works are required), for most energy projects the labour
inputs in both construction and operation are relatively small. Technical Note M1 discusses
the need for adjustments to the exchange rate (using either the standard correction factor, SCF
or the shadow exchange rate, SER).

Externalities
34.      What externalities will be considered? As noted, in the case of GHG emissions, the
Bank’s new Guidance Notes on both carbon accounting and the valuation of carbon are now in
place.19 But for local air emission damage costs, impacts on downstream fisheries, or valuation
of lost forestry, there is much scope for judgement. What non-use values should be included,
and how should they be quantified? Technical Note C3 includes a checklist of externalities
(both positive and negative) that generally apply to different kinds of power sector projects,
and provides examples of their assessment and monetisation.


6.      IDENTIFYING PROJECT BENEFITS

Valuation of fossil fuels
35.     Correct valuation of fossil fuels is fundamental to almost every type of power sector
project
  Generation projects: the cost of fossil fuel is often the largest single cost item (in NPV terms).
  T&D projects: technical loss reduction is often an important component of benefits, which
    translates to avoided consumption of thermal fuels.
  Renewable energy projects: the avoided cost of fossil fuel is the principal economic benefit of a
    RE project.
  Energy Efficiency: whether these displace oil and coal, or electricity that (at the margin) will
    indirectly displace thermal fuels, correct valuation is again critical.

17      The best non-technical explanation of shadow pricing is still that in Chapter 12 of R. Turvey and Dennis
        Anderson, Electricity Economics: Essays and Case Studies, Johns Hopkins for the World Bank, 1977 (“A
        Layman’s Guide to Shadow Pricing?).
18      In all of the ADB projects reviewed, unskilled labor inputs are adjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 85%,
        but the source of this adjustment is unclear.
19      World Bank, 2015. Guidance Note: Greenhouse Gas Accounting for Energy Investment Operations: Transmission &
        Distribution Projects, Power Generation Projects and Energy Efficiency Projects, Version 2, January 2015.
September 2015                                                                                                   12
      Rural electrification: access to the grid may increase thermal generation in the grid, but will
       be offset by lower use of kerosene for lighting and diesel for self-generation: both are often
       subsidised, so these displaced fuels should be valued at their economic price, not their
       financial price (with the necessary reconciliation of economic and financial costs presented
       in the distributional analysis).

36.     Where fossil fuels are imported there are few issues, the relevant economic cost being
the border price at the point of import (on a cif basis). 20 More difficult is the appropriate
valuation in the case of countries that produce their own thermal fuels (or are even fuel
exporting countries).

37.      In some countries the price regime for domestic fuel has been aligned to international
price levels (such as coal pricing to the Indonesian power company PLN). But in others,
domestic fuel prices for power generation still remain subsidised (gas in Egypt, coal in Vietnam
and South Africa). The problem of valuation is also complex in cases where high quality coal
is exported (at a well documented price), but the domestic market uses low quality coal which
has no export market – in which case the opportunity cost of coal used for domestic power
generation is much lower than the international price. And even where a fuel is exported
(such as gas exports from Egypt to Jordan), the negotiated price often reflects other foreign
policy objectives, so the stated border price may not necessarily reflect the real opportunity cost
of the resource in question.

38.      Technical Note C1 offers guidance for the proper valuation of the opportunity costs of
thermal fuels, and shows examples of appropriate netback calculations to establish import
parity prices. Even where a least cost planning model is in place, it is sometimes run by the
utility using financial prices, so the input assumptions need careful review by the economist.


7.         ALTERNATIVES
39.      The Bank’s guidelines require the consideration of a “no project? alternative. The idea
of “no project? is sometimes derided as unrealistic, because in face of increasing electricity
demands associated with economic development, not building any additional generation
projects is simply not plausible. Yet the fact remains that many countries are indeed facing
severe power shortages because insufficient capacity has been added. And it is also true that
many countries have very high T&D losses, mitigation of which may well have higher returns
than building new supply. These issues are often discussed at some length in the project
justification and sector context sections of a PAD, but the question remains on whether and
how these issues should also be treated in the economic analysis.

40.      For most projects there exists a hierarchy of alternatives, illustrated for a hydro project
as follows:
          Alternatives to supply side expansion (DSM, T&D loss reduction)?
          Alternatives for peaking power additions (why hydro and not CCGT? or
           coal+pumped storage?)
          Other renewable energy alternatives (why hydro and not wind or geothermal?)
          Alternative hydro projects - given a set of candidate hydro projects, why this
           particular project?
          For the specific project proposed, alternative sites, reservoir sizes, dam axes, and
           installed capacity alternatives.

41.     For large projects with a detailed Feasibility Study (FS) already in place or underway,
some of this analysis would often already have been done by the time Government requests
assistance from the Bank, and upon which the economic analysis can draw. But for many


20         These may need to be adjusted for transportation differentials to derive the so-called import parity price
           (explained in Technical Note C1).
September 2015                                                                                                   13
smaller projects such questions will often remain to be assessed, and will fall on the project
economist to answer during preparation of the PAD.

42.    Comparisons of levelised cost of energy (LCOR) should be used with caution:
geothermal and coal, both delivering base load power, can be validly compared in a simple
LCOE analysis; but coal and wind, or coal and gas-fired combustion turbines can not (see
Technical Note C1).

The counter-factual
43.      The best-counterfactual for a grid-connected power generation project is developed
with the assistance of a generation expansion planning model – which should be run with and
without the proposed project. This is a practical approach only where a country’s utility
already has the capacity to have run such models for some years. But not all countries have a
WASP model (or equivalent) in place, and some that do may yet require help to run the model
for the particular purpose of a project CBA. Moreover it is not always clear whether such
models have the ability to properly account for renewable energy variability (whether over
very short time intervals, seasonal, or even inter-annual variations).21 Furthermore, the
sequence of large hydro projects is often forced exogenously into such models according to the
state of readiness, rather than in order of economic merit.

44.     The main challenge is how to construct a credible counter-factual when such a model is
not available. This is crucial where avoided carbon emissions of the thermal alternative are to
be considered: it matters greatly whether it is coal, oil or gas – or indeed some mix of all of
them – are displaced. Technical Note T4 discusses further the problems of selecting an
appropriate counter-factual for renewable energy technologies.

45.      The most difficult counter-factual is for generation rehabilitation projects. Predicting
alternative futures for an existing plant in serious decline is subject to high uncertainty (for
example, how much can conditions degrade before the plant would be abandoned completely;
or in the case of a hydro project, how soon would the active storage be degraded by sediment
in the absence of proper sediment management practice?). Setting up the “no project?
alternative requires detailed consultation with the relevant engineering experts.


8.      THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
46.      Just as the financial analysis included in PADs follows a standard format (following
the conventions of financial accountancy), the economic analysis should follow a standard form
for the summary presentation of the baseline economic analysis which should be included in
the main text of the PAD in the appraisal summary section. This may usefully follow the format
presented in the PAD of the Noor CSP project (Table 3.1): here the choice of discount rate was
one of the main issues - in other projects the columns may represent a different set of important
alternative parameters for the calculation of economic returns. This format displays the major
components of costs and benefits, and the calculations of ERR and NPV are presented
          without externalities
          with avoided local externalities
          with avoided local + global externalities

                                                                                     Govt.           ONE

21      For example, many countries have experienced significant inter-annual variations in annual average wind
        speeds (in both China and India, as well in Northwestern Europe, significant decreases in annual wind
        speeds have been observed - and their cause or whether these are part of some natural long-term cycle still
        remains a matter of research).
22      In this example, the calculation of the Government’s opportunity cost of capital was based on the interest
        rates of recent Euro and US$ bond issuances: of course not all countries have such a track record of
        successful bond sales as guidance.

Minimum requirements
47.     Particularly in the case of small projects, the question of what constitutes an acceptable
analysis arises frequently. To this end we provide in the Annex Volume a set of tables that
describe what is minimally acceptable. We note that the Bank’s new carbon accounting
guidelines apply to all projects, which necessarily requires all power sector projects enumerate
the types of thermal energy that is generated or saved. The following tables should be
provided in all economic analysis of power projects, each showing annual values over the
expected economic lifetime.
 Macroeconomic assumptions, including forecasts of future border prices for thermal
    generation fuels, inflation, exchange rates, GDP growth (relevant for health damage cost
    assessment)
 Electricity Balances, that display the flow of energy through all of the affected parts of the
    system, and account for own-use, T&D losses and the type of thermal generation that is
    avoided or added. In the case of T&D projects, these balances need to be prepared with
    and without the proposed intervention for a reliable calculation of the net impacts.
 Calculation of economic returns, with an enumeration of each of the major economic
    flows, in sufficient detail to permit preparation of the summary table shown in Table 3.1.
 Carbon accounting table: with sufficient detail to achieve a reliable calculation of lifetime
    and yearly emissions from each of the different types and sources of fossil fuels
    avoided/added.
 Calculation of economic returns including externalities: estimates of economic returns
    using the Bank’s guidelines for the social cost of carbon is now required for all energy
    sector projects. Any project involving coal generation (including renewable energy
    projects that displace coal) should also include an estimate of local environmental damage
    costs (added or avoided).

Capacity credit
48.      The question of capacity benefits arise in a wide variety of power sector projects. That a
T&D loss reduction or energy efficiency project avoids energy losses is uncontroversial, but the
extent to which it also avoids capacity costs is more difficult to answer. For example, an energy
efficiency project may install waste heat recovery for power generation to meet power needs
previously supplied by the grid. At the margin, the grid supplier will avoid the variable
September 2015                                                                                             15
generation costs of the most expensive units. But whether the supplier avoids capacity costs
will depend on the way in which the unit is operated (and avoided generation capacity may
not necessarily also avoid transmission capacity costs).

49.     Among renewable energy projects, if provided with thermal storage CSP is among the
renewable energy technologies that command a significant capacity credit (in the case shown in
Table 3.1, the capacity credit accounts for some 20% of the total benefit). The same is true of
geothermal projects that have typical load factors of 90%, and often displace baseload coal
generation.23 But for other renewable energy technologies, the claim of capacity credit is more
controversial and requires careful consideration, particularly in light of much greater seasonal
variation of wind speeds than is experienced in the US and Europe (see Technical Note T1).

Discount rates
50.      The choice of discount rate in the calculation of economic returns is critical, but has
become increasingly controversial in connection with the climate change debate and the
estimation of the damage costs of GHG emissions. For some time, in the absence of country-
specific studies on the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCK), or a Government directive
to use some specific rate, the Bank has been using 10-12% as a default. Most countries that run
power sector capacity expansion models use similar discount rates. This default has been
criticised on two grounds; first, that it discriminates against projects that have long and even
inter-generational benefits, and secondly that in fact the real cost of capital is much lower today
(and in the foreseeable future) than was the case in the 1980s and 1990s. The Bank has now
taken up this problem, and plans to issue new bank-wide guidance on discount rates in the
very near future. 24

Decision-criteria
51.     Many decision criteria have been proposed for CBA:
 The economic rate of return (ERR) (project is economic if ERR>economic opportunity cost
    of capital, EOCK)
 Net present value (NPV) (project is economic if NPV at EOCK >0)
 Benefit-cost ratio (project is economic if >1)
 Payback period
The first three of these are often taken as equivalent and particularly so for NPV and ERR. But
they are not in fact so.

52.      The rate of return is defective as a measure of the relative merit of mutually exclusive
projects: a higher rate of return does not necessarily indicate a superior alternative as measured
by the size of the surplus when costs and benefits are discounted at the shadow rate of interest.
For this reason, World Bank practice is to use NPV as the main decision criterion. An
additional issue that when there is more than one reversal of sign in the net annual flows, the
ERR calculation may have multiple solutions. 25 Nevertheless, the (internal) rate of economic
return is a widely understood concept and serves as a compact summary measure of economic
merit. Consequently the World Bank PADs report both ERR and NPV.26

53.     ERR should be especially avoided in any ranking exercise – say for an on-lending
operation to support multiple small hydro projects. In such cases the choice should be made
on the basis of maximizing the total NPV given the capital constraint, which rarely provides

23      Among renewable energy technologies, some daily-peaking small hydro and some biomass projects can also
        credibly claim a capacity credit.
24      Once this bank-wide discount rate guidance note has been issued, the planned Technical Note C8 on
        discount rates for power sector projects will be issued.
25      Normally there is just one sign reversal – negative flows in the early years reflecting investment, positive
        once the project is in operation. But some projects may require large additional expenditures during the
        operating period (e.g., in the case of a hydro project, turbine runner replacement) that may cause a negative
        net economic flow in some years.
26      ADB practice is different. Many of the renewable energy project appraisals reviewed report only the ERR.
September 2015                                                                                                     16
the same subproject selection as given by choosing the first n projects from a list ranked by
ERR. Benefit cost ratios are similarly misleading, as are traditional business indicators such as
payback period: both are incorrect indicators of economic profitability.27


9.      FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
54.     Traditional World Bank practice has been for the project economic analysis to be
accompanied by a so-called “project? financial analysis, with the calculation of a project FIRR.
Taxes and duties and other transfer payments excluded to derive economic costs are added
back in, and the resulting financial return compared to the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC). If FIRR>WACC, a project is deemed financially feasible. Both the FIRR and the
WACC were calculated at constant prices.

55.      This may have been useful when almost all power sector projects were in the hands of
a vertically integrated, state-owned utility, and where, in effect, financing was on the balance
sheet of this entity, and for which a utility-wide WACC calculation was relevant. It has also
been argued that this avoids setting out the details of financing which may not be fully known
at the time of project appraisal. Thus much of the emphasis in financial analysis of traditional
power sector projects was on the financial condition of the borrower: in reality the project FIRR
at constant prices commanded little attention.

56.      This approach has diminishing relevance today. Many power sector projects are
implemented as Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs), whose financing is essentially on a project
finance basis, and whose financial acceptability to private investors is based on actual expected
and nominal cash flows. The financial structure of such projects is integral to the special
purpose vehicles (SPVs) that are created to develop and implement projects. In any event, the
WACC calculation does not take into account loan tenors which is central to the determination
of cash flows, and to the debt service cover ratio (DSCR).

57.      In the absence of an explicit understanding of the impact of project financing on cash
flows, it is very difficult to see how the OPSPQ requirement that the economic analysis assess
the financial sustainability of a project can be reliably provided by the traditional approach.
Indeed, the project financial return at constant prices provides no useful information about
actual likely project cash flows, and the crucial relationship between tariffs (and their
adjustments) and debt service cash requirements. Moreover, in portfolio projects involving on-
lending to commercial banks (or even to subproject borrowers), credible assessment of FOREX
risks (especially on concessionary loans with very long tenors) is impossible in the framework
of the traditional project FIRR approach.

58.     A good economic analysis provides a reconciliation of economic and financial flows,
which is a prerequisite for a distributional analysis that identifies the impacts on the main
stakeholders. Thus a good economic analysis model will be linked to a financial model: since
many assumptions are common to both, it greatly eases a transparent reconciliation of
economic and financial flows. Nowhere is such a reconciliation and consistency more
important than in rural electrification and off-grid renewable projects, where the economic
benefits of household electrification are derived from the financial prices experienced by
consumers: the kerosene that is replaced by grid electricity is often subsidised, so a substantial
economic impact derives from the avoidance of deadweight losses associated with the
elimination of such subsidies.


10.     DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS
59.     The point of a distributional analysis is to quantify the impact of a project on the
stakeholders, among which there will be winners and losers. This is a particularly important

question for high cost renewable energy projects: who bears the incremental financial costs is
the central question. With many renewable energy projects involving highly concessionary
finance (such as CTF) and on-lending operations, identification of exactly who benefits from
such financing, and by how much, is critical to long-term sustainability: the risk is always that
at some point, Government decides it can no longer afford the subsidy to a high-cost project.
Technical Note C6 offers suggestions on how the distributional analysis can be presented, and
how to cross the bridge between the baseline economic analysis at constant prices, and a
financial analysis that is at nominal prices.

60.      One of the reasons for the lack of good distributional analysis is that economic and
financial analyses are often conducted as separate studies, and often by different individuals: a
financial analyst prepares the project financials, and an economist prepares the assessment of
economic returns. Yet distributional analysis requires the reconciliation of economic and
financial flows because the stakeholders perceive the impact as financial. In a power sector
often riddled with subsidies, there also arise deadweight losses, which constitute economic
costs no less than consumer surplus constitutes an economic benefit. A plausible counter-
factual is another essential prerequisite for a good distributional analysis: what matters is the
net impact of the project on the stakeholders, relative to the counterfactual.

61.       The transparent recovery of incremental costs lies at the heart of whether a support
tariff for renewable energy can be successful. There are many examples of countries setting up
“renewable energy funds? that do not have a credible source of long term funding (“Funds
without funds?), or renewable energy tariffs that are either excessively generous or set at a
level so low as not to enable any projects. The special problems of the financial sustainability
of renewable energy projects are discussed in Annex I.

CBA and poverty alleviation.
62.     The question of the extent to which traditional analytical practice in CBA reflects
equity concerns is not new: already the 1975 World Bank’s classic textbook on project economic
analysis proposed the use of distribution weights in CBA to reflect equity concerns. 28

63.      Many large power sector projects (and hydro projects in particular) are located in
relatively remote rural areas, and the directly affected families who may require resettlement,
or whose livelihoods are affected, are often among a country’s poorest inhabitants. Estimating
the costs of R&R as provided by the Bank’s safeguards policies is generally straightforward,
and easily incorporated as a line item in the table of economic flows. Under the presumption
that project affected persons (PAFs) are completely compensated by the project, the net impact
on PAFs would be zero. However, some social mitigation plans seek not just to compensate
PAFs, but improve their standard of living: even if described as “benefit sharing,? such
additional improvements constitute a transfer payment and should not be treated as a project
(economic) cost.29

64.      Recently, CGE models are coming into use for Poverty and Social Impact Assessment
(PSIA) to assess the welfare impacts of larger energy projects (including Development Policy
Loans tied to power sector reform).30 The economist charged with the CBA should consult
with the PSIA economist to ensure consistency of assumptions, and to ensure that any
significant welfare impacts on households are captured in the distributional analysis.

        point. Some 4,000 persons are planned to be relocated, but the budget cost estimate for the Social Mitigation
        Plan (SMP) is $470 million (or more than $100,000 per person!) How much of this survives the final project
        implementation remains to be seen, but the Dasu SMP stresses the commitment not just to compensation, but
        to achieving an improvement of the socio-economic well-being of those affected by the project.

Project type         Issues
Grid-connected       In most cases consumers will experience little change in tariff from even expensive
renewable energy     renewable energy projects at the penetration levels expected in the early years of
                     increased renewable energy generation: such projects can hardly make a credible
                     claim to benefit low income groups (or any particular set of consumers).
                     However, there may arise significant equity considerations in the recovery of
                     incremental costs. In Malaysia, the incremental costs of the renewable energy FIT
                     are recovered by a 1% levy on all electricity customers who consume more than
                     300kWh/month, or whose bills exceed 37 Ringgit/month ($10.60), thereby shielding
                     lower income consumers.31 Who bears such incremental costs is best assessed in the
                     distributional analysis.
Rural                Invariably such projects disproportionately benefit lower income consumers that
electrification&     predominate in rural areas. How such benefits of electrification are evaluated raises
off-grid             many issues, addressed in Technical Note M2.
renewable energy
Generation           If a new generation project is deemed to have incremental benefits, then (as in off-
projects             grid projects), the power benefits accrue to the extant mix of consumers. The extent
                     to which these include the poorer sections of society would need a case by case
                     evaluation. In the Tarbela T4 hydro project, which was designed primarily to
                     alleviate summer power shortages, the main benefits would accrue to agricultural
                     users (who would switch from diesel pump-sets to grid power). However, pump
                     sets tend to be owned by the better-off farmers rather than the rural poor.


11.     SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
65.      Notwithstanding the guidance of the existing Handbook on Economic Analysis that calls
for calculation and discussion of switching values, in many economic analyses sensitivity
analysis is limited to recalculations of ERR/NPV for a few input variables by some fixed
percentage. Such an approach is unacceptable. Calculation of switching values is required for
all projects. Technical Note M1 describes the recommended approach for the presentation of
an adequate sensitivity analysis.

66.      As noted above, one of the main issues for project appraisal is the extent to which the
risks of a project should be considered in the investment decision. Even if measures are taken
to mitigate some of the enumerated risks (and their costs of mitigation included as project
costs), substantial uncertainty over factors beyond the control of implementing agencies and
EPC contractors will remain. Some are related to natural resource variability (such as wind
and hydrology); others are related to the state of the global economy and world energy
markets. Some of these uncertainties about the future are best handled in a scenario analysis;
others are best illuminated by an explicit assessment of the trade-off between risk and returns –
as discussed in Technical Note C5.

67.      The discussion of consumptive water use (in Step 5) illustrates the role of sensitivity
analysis in identifying how the resources available for economic analysis are best spent, and in
identifying the need for more detailed study to firm up key costs and benefits. As noted there,
the need for detailed study of the opportunity cost of water in an arid country will depend on
the sensitivity of the economic returns to the value of that assumption. If the switching value
indicates that hurdle rate would not be met if the economic cost of water were 100 times the
financial cost, then further study is not required: if it is twice the financial cost then further
investigation would be required, For thermal generation projects that may lead to a decision to
use dry cooling rather than evaporative cooling - and illustrates the role of economic analysis
in project design just as the OPSPQ guideline suggests.


31      By contrast, in Germany until very recently it has been the largest industrial consumers who have been
        exempt from the surcharge to recover the costs of the FIT. In 2012, German residential customers paid
        $0.25/kWh for electricity, of which the surcharge for the feed-in tariff levy accounted for $0.039/kWh, or
        13.9% of the average bill. This surcharge rose to $0.0528/kWh in 2013. (K. Neuhoff and others, 2013.

12.     RISK ASSESSMENT
68.     In recent years, project risks have been summarised in a PAD risk matrix. But few
PADs have made much effort to coordinate the economic analysis with the risks and their
mitigation as enumerated in this matrix. The converse is also true: it is rare for the PAD risk
matrix to refer to the results of the economic analysis risk assessment.

69.    For example, the risk of delay and cost overruns is often identified in the risk matrix,
but nevertheless the economic analysis is silent on the subject. Not all risks can be quantified
and monetised, but those that can – and delay and construction cost overruns are certainly
among these – always deserve examination in the economic analysis.

70.     Indeed, one of the practical reasons that the OPSPQ guidelines call for the involvement
of the project economist already at the PCN stage is to make sure that the design of the project
benefits from the results of at least a preliminary economic analysis. The main point of the
economic analysis risk assessment is to prioritise and focus risk mitigation measures to ensure
the robustness of the economic returns. A well structured project preparation effort requires
the TTL (generally responsible for the preparation of the PAD risk matrix) and the project
economist to inform each other.

71.      In its assessment of CBA at the Bank, IEG argues that "variability of a project's expected
NPV around its mean should not carry weight in decisions". This view goes back to the Bank's
traditional public sector lending to governments, who are assumed to wish to maximize the
expected NPV of their portfolio of projects (i.e., they are presumed to be risk neutral).32 IEG
takes the view that risk assessment is relevant mainly for the identification of mitigation
strategies. However, to use an illustrative example, suppose the best ranked alternative A has
an expected NPV (net benefits) of $500m, with variance $150m (say as revealed by a Monte
Carlo simulation of the probability distribution of NPV/ERR), but the second ranked option B
has an expected value of NPV of $490 million with a variance of $50million. Risk neutrality
would dictate that A be chosen, rather than B that has a lower NPV but which is more robust
with respect to exogenous uncertainties.33

72.     The presumption of risk neutrality may well apply in some instances, and may be
appropriate for Bank projects considering portfolios of small to medium sized sub-projects
(often encountered in on-lending operations). But in the case of large power projects this may
not be the case. Indeed, with the World Bank increasingly involved in public-private
partnerships (PPP), and particularly so for larger hydro and renewable energy projects, the
private sector's evaluation of project risks is rarely risk neutral. International private power
developers may well have a portfolio of projects under development in different countries, and
may well be primarily concerned with the performance of their total portfolio. However
individual projects are still subjected to intense scrutiny and requirements to ensure equity
returns appropriate to risks at each stage of project development. Technical Note C5 (risk
analysis) discusses further the treatment of risk in project appraisal, and the use of tools
derived from financial portfolio management to assist in both policy analysis and project
evaluation (Technical Note M8).




32      The full discussion is to be found on p.98 of the Handbook.
33      Exogenous uncertainties are those which are outside the control of the Government and not amenable to
        mitigation at the project level – such as the future world oil price or the extent of climate change (that will
        largely be determined by the world’s big carbon emitters, not the typical small developing country that
        account for most of the Bank’s clients).
September 2015                                                                                                     20
Real options34
73.      One approach to deal with uncertainty and its resolution is the application of so-called
real options (developed originally for financial markets). A real option is the right, but not the
obligation, to invest in a future project of unknown benefit at a known cost today. Just like
buying a plot of land gives you the right (but not obligation) to erect a building in the future, a
real option implies at least two time steps – a decision to be made today, followed by a decision
to be made tomorrow. 35

74.      There are several necessary conditions for the real option value approach to be
suitable: uncertainty, learning and flexibility – which we can illustrate in the case of a hydro
project for which the commissioning of a detailed feasibility study (FS) is an example: 36
     Uncertainty: without which there is no need to consider the possibility of deferring an
         investment decision: if the future is already known the best decision under certainty
         can be made now. But one does not start dam construction before the major
         geotechnical , hydrology and environmental uncertainties have been resolved.
     Learning: information regarding uncertainty must change over time. The FS
         represents that learning. If it is unlikely that uncertainties will be resolved over time,
         then one might as well make a decision today. 37
     Flexibility: if the FS shows that the hydro project will be uneconomic (or technically
         infeasible), one must be prepared not to proceed, or to delay a the investment pending
         resolution or narrowing of uncertainty over time.

75.    Technical Note C4 provides a more detailed discussion of these alternative decision-
making frameworks.38 In the past decade a number of transmission planning and investment
problems in the developed countries have been cast as real options. 39

76.     At this point in the analysis it should become clear under what circumstances the
economic returns of a proposed energy project meet the hurdle rate. Under the current
guidelines this means that when all relevant externalities have been quantified and monetized,
including GHG emissions (or their avoidance) at the values now set for project appraisal, the
hurdle rate is achieved.

Scenario analysis
77.     As an adjunct to a Monte Carlo simulation one may conduct a scenario analysis which
compares plausible worst cases – in which all the input assumptions take on pessimistic values
together - against the baseline. This addresses the concerns of the IEG CBA evaluation that
analysts are prone to selecting what are judged to be the most likely values for all input



34      There are many good texts. T. Copeland and V. Antikarov, Real Options: A Practitioner’s Guide, Texere, New
        York, 2001 is one of them.

        Uncertainty: Application to Climate Change, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 6193.
36      One may note that a FS for a large hydro project runs into the millions of dollars. That means that even
        before one embarks on a FS, one should ask what the FS would need to say about capital costs for the hydro
        project to be competitive with other thermal peaking options. If a hydro project would have to cost less than
        $1,000/kW to be competitive with gas or imports, why spend $5million for an outcome that seems most
        improbable?
37      Even with the benefits of a FS, however, not all geotechnical problems can be resolved – there are several
        examples of dam axes being changed once construction started, and foundation and geological fault
        conditions verified. Similarly, notwithstanding that commercial lenders often insist they take no tunneling
        risk (which means that the costs of unexpected conditions must be covered by equity), depending on terrain
        it may be judged uneconomic to confirm by drilling at the FS stage the actual rock conditions deep
        underground. A FS can never eliminate all uncertainty.

variables, presuming a future that is rarely realised, with the result that economic returns are
often over-estimated.40

78.      Such a scenario analysis may need several iterations with inputs from the team (and
from the client) to develop plausible worst cases. It is also useful to examine the plausible best
case scenario, and to then proceed to a formal decision-analysis that takes into account the risk
preferences of decision-makers, and the economic consequences of having to make decisions
under highly uncertain assumptions - as well illustrated by the potential consequences of the
current decline in oil prices were they to persist for several years (see example in Technical
Note C4). Several recent hydro project appraisals have used scenario analysis to test the
robustness of economic returns to worst case conditions and serious accidents (which in case of
hydro projects is powerhouse flooding attributable to extreme weather events or equipment
failures: the costs of such events being not just the cost of repair, but also the cost of lost
generation41).


13.      ADDITIONAL STUDIES
79.      As recognised in the OPSPQ guidelines, not all the information necessary to assess the
full set of expected project consequences may be available at the PCN stage. In setting the
analytical form and scope of the analysis, the OPSPQ guidelines require that the economist: 42
      Delineate the causal framework that links the project activity to ultimate outcomes of interest. List
      the major assumptions utilized by the causal chain framework. Define a clear link between project
      activity, intermediate outcomes/objectives, and ultimate outcomes/outputs (program development
      objectives) within the result chain framework:
       (i)        Determine whether this is a project where the results chain is well established and
                  documented. Determine how to effectively utilize this prior knowledge.
       (ii)       Determine whether it would be appropriate for supplementary studies to be supported
                  by, or conducted in conjunction with, project activities in order to improve knowledge
                  around project impacts and important mitigating factors. These studies may run the
                  gamut from small-scale observational exercises to a full-blown prospective impact
                  evaluation, depending on the informational needs and timeframe of the project.

80.      In addition, the OPSPQ guidelines recognise that 43
      . . . . In many projects in today’s portfolio it may not be possible to arrive at a comprehensive
      monetary value of benefits, or else prohibitively costly to do so, once more making it difficult to
      provide a numerical estimate of the rate the return

81.     In the case of some high cost renewable energy projects, it is often argued that several
positive project outcomes provide additional justification, but which are excluded from the
customary quantification of economic flows: the usual economic rate of return therefore
provides only a partial picture of potential benefits. These benefits relate to
     Energy security
     Macroeconomic impacts (including beneficial employment impacts)
     Learning curve benefits (whose benefits to society can only be realised in the future if
        projects in the early phase of the learning curve for new technology are financed today)

Energy Security
82.     Energy security has rarely been clearly defined, which makes it hard to measure and
therefore difficult to balance against other policy objectives. Indeed, discussion of energy
security requires much caution and scepticism: as noted by the eminent MIT economist Paul
Joskow, “There is one thing that has not changed since the early 1970s. If you cannot think of a

reasoned rationale for some policy based on standard economic reasoning, then argue that the policy is
necessary to promote “energy security.?44

83.      A large and growing literature discusses energy security, but very little of this is
relevant to the specific question of whether energy security benefits can be quantified in a form
useful to CBA: that is, framed as a line item in the tabulation of economic flows. Policy-makers
in many countries assert that energy security is of great concern, but often they do little to use
the already available tools to improve the financial and physical dimensions of energy security
(fossil fuel price hedging, increasing tank farm storage, etc.)       Nor do many place much
emphasis on energy efficiency and efficient pricing policy, both of which reduce the
vulnerability of an energy system to all of the risks and uncertainties associated with energy
supply.

84.      Thus one of the pitfalls is to claim benefits against imaginary concerns. It is claimed, for
example, that RE will improve energy security because a country will be less vulnerable to
supply disruptions and price volatility of imported fossil fuels. But were that indeed a concern,
then the question would be how the incremental costs of a RE project compares to other
alternatives to address the same concern as may be proposed by Government even in the
absence of any renewable energy projects – for example, by mandating increased physical
storage (say an extra 30 days coal supply to be stockpiled at coal projects, or the establishment
of a strategic petroleum reserve).45

85.     The large literature on the macroeconomic consequences of fossil fuel price shocks
concludes that the impacts are not symmetrical – the loss of GDP following the price shock is
not regained once the price decreases again. Consequently any policy that reduces exposure to
price shock by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels would be of economic benefit.

86.     But translating these effects into an oil price volatility risk premium that can be
included in the ERR calculations is difficult, and rarely attempted. A recent study for Latin
America by the Inter-American Development Bank suggests this risk premium to be very
small, (0.01 USc/kWh), an order of magnitude lower than the damage costs from local air
pollution of thermal generation.46 A study to develop an avoided cost tariff for Indonesian
geothermal development estimates the volatility premium at 0.07 USc/kWh (estimated as the
cost to Ministry of Finance of short-term financing of unexpected increased subsidy to PLN in
wake of forecasting errors of PLN’s fuel costs attributable to unforeseen price volatility).47
Another study for the EU shows the cost of the “oil security externality? to be less than 0.01
Eurocent/kWh.48

87.     One approach is to define energy security as an attribute in a broader evaluation of the
tradeoffs between economic returns and risk using mean-variance portfolio theory, which
examines the trade-off between expected economic returns (say measured as the levelised cost
of energy) against risk (standard deviation of returns). 49 Nevertheless, the central question for

45      An ongoing ESMAP study for Afghanistan proposes a methodology for evaluating energy environmental-

        number of post-conflict World Bank client countries). The study will be completed later in 2015.

49      As proposed by Auerbuch and others who argue that the role of renewables in a portfolio of generating
        assets is the same as the role of relatively risk fee treasuries in a financial portfolio (see, e.g., S. Auerbuch,
        2000. Getting it Right: the Real Cost Impacts of a Renewables Portfolio Standard, Public Utilities Fortnightly,
        February 15)

any energy security argument for renewable energy – in essence an argument for less exposure
to fossil fuel price volatility risk – is whether the incremental cost of renewable is a more cost-
effective hedge than relevant alternatives, and how much a decision-maker is prepared to pay
for that lower risk. These questions about the ability to quantify energy security benefits, and
the extent to which they can be incorporated in the table of economic flows, are discussed
further in Technical Note C7.

Macroeconomic benefits
88.      A general discussion of energy-macroeconomic linkages lies outside the scope of this
paper. We take as given that provision of electricity is fundamental to economic development,
and that severe and prolonged power shortages impede the rate of economic growth. The
welfare benefits of electrification are well established (and are confirmed by the IEG study of
this topic).50 Equally well-established are the macroeconomic penalties associated with
excessive (and often poorly targeted) subsidies on electricity and the fuels used to generate it.
With rare exceptions (for very large projects in small countries), 51 few power sector projects
need to run CGE and input/output models to evaluate macro-economic consequences as part
of project appraisals. In most cases the presumption is that a project is too small to affect
labour markets. However, as noted earlier, recently CGE modelling has been used in the PSIA
of a large power sector reform DPC project where significant price changes are anticipated as a
result of subsidy and efficiency reforms, with significant potential for negative impacts on poor
households.

Learning curve benefits
89.      So called learning curve benefits are often raised as a justification for Bank finance of
projects that cannot be justified at today’s technology and GHG damage costs, but which
deserve support at the early stages of the learning curve – for in the absence of early stage
projects, potential technology cost reductions would never be achieved. The dramatic falls in
the cost of solar PV are often held up as an example. Potential learning curve benefits are not
restricted to renewable energy: carbon capture and storage (CCS), and new nuclear technology
will be subject to similar cost reductions as the technology matures. However, such
technologies involving large mechanical and thermal components (including CSP, CCS and
advanced nuclear reactors) cannot be expected to have the same rates of learning as PV.

90.      Learning curve benefits are of two types: those whose benefits can validly be included
in the project economic flows, and those whose benefits cannot be assigned to the project under
appraisal, but accrue to other projects in the future.

91.      The first makes assumptions about the reductions in average cost of technology
achievable during a second phase of a project – for example, in the economic analysis of the
Egypt Wind Project it was assumed that the cost of wind energy will decrease from 8 to 5
USc/kWh as a consequence of “increasing technical efficiency?. However, no further
justification was offered, presumably reflecting the view that these cost decreases are self-
evident. Such unsupported assumptions should be avoided - or at the very least subjected to a
switching value analysis to display the impact on economic returns.
92.      The Bank’s literature reveals just two serious attempts at quantifying the learning
curve benefits of the second type – for wind power as part of the project preparation for the
China Renewable Energy Scale-up Project (CRESP), and for the Morocco Noor II&III CSP
projects. In both cases a benefit cost analysis was prepared that takes the form of defining as
costs the subsidies required to build projects at present costs today, to be balanced against the

        Benefits. World Bank, 2008.
51      The Mahaweli Ganga Scheme (irrigation and power) in Sri Lanka would be one of these exceptions – a
        project so large as to have consumed a major share of national capital expenditure and labor inputs
        (crowding out investment in other sectors), and changed to such large extent agricultural productivity that
        significant changes in the structure of the economy resulted: see, e.g., World Bank, 2012. Sri Lanka: Mahaweli
        Ganga Development, Independent Evaluation Group.
September 2015                                                                                                      24
future benefits that are expressed as the difference between the lower (future) cost of the
technology against the fossil fuelled alternative. Technical Note T3 summarises these two
studies, but too little work is currently available to make a best practice recommendation on
this subject.

93.      Learning curve benefits do not change the economic flows of the project being financed
at today’s capital costs. Nor do they answer the question of who bears the incremental costs of
a high-cost renewable energy project in the short term. It is only relevant as additional
justification for the World Bank to finance such projects – and therefore informs the second of
the three main questions for economic analysis required by the new OPSPQ guidelines.

94.     Another way of thinking about learning curve benefits is as a real option. Investment
in a CSP today will (likely) have a negative NPV. But in 20 years time, in the absence of such
CSP projects today the option to use CSP to stave off catastrophic climate change would not be
available (or only at prohibitive cost in the absence of prior learning). So an investment in CSP
today is desirable because it will create the option of rapid (and low cost) decarbonisation in
the future, not because of its own return in the short run.52


14.     MULTI-ATTRIBUTE TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS (MATA)
95.     Cost-benefit analysis is the standard tool for evaluating projects in Bank Practice. The
presumption is that provided all of the relevant externalities can be included in the economic
flows, the correct investment decision follows from choosing that alternative with the highest
NPV. But as recognised by OPSPQ, this is not always possible.

96.      Multi-attribute decision analysis is one approach to go beyond the single objective cost-
benefit analysis as a basis for making decisions. This offers some practical help in coming to
better decisions in face of multiple objectives where not all variables of interest can be
monetised; by providing better insights into the problems by forcing clarity about goals and
risks; by facilitating understanding (if not agreement) among diverse stakeholders; and by
assisting decision-makers in making trade-offs.

97.     In the assessment of renewable energy technologies, GHG emissions are often treated
as a separate attribute precisely because their valuation is controversial, and invite distracting
debate about discount rates. Undiscounted lifetime GHG emissions is thus an often-
encountered attribute (and is also used by the CTF calculation of marginal abatement cost).
MATA is discussed in detail in Technical Note M6.

         cost escalation and delays).          Note that
         traditional least-cost planning models chose capacity based on firm capacity available
         at the time of the system peak, to which wind and solar generally contribute very
         little.53
      Because a project is the least cost way of achieving carbon emission reductions . The
         Indonesia geothermal project is an excellent example: the capacity expansion plan
         shows coal to be the least-cost option for meeting base load requirements. But the
         Government is committed to power sector carbon emission reductions, and among the
         available renewable energy options, geothermal is the least-cost way of achieving such
         reductions. The principal challenge in this kind of project is a demonstration that
         economic returns are assured when the relevant externalities and uncertainties are
         properly valued. In the case of variable renewables (such as wind and run-of-river
         hydro) there is the additional problem of properly recognising the costs of
         intermittency, seasonal, and inter-annual variation.
      Because a project is the least cost way of reducing local air pollution : This has been
         one of the main drivers of renewable energy projects in China, and to a lesser extent in
         India as well. However, the “least cost? rationale needs careful justification, and a RE
         project needs to be compared to other interventions as well (for example, the Bank’s


53      However, as noted in Technical Note T1, portfolios of renewable energy projects of different types and in
        different locations may provide system wide capacity benefits that may well not apply to a single project.

         cost-effective than new renewable energy projects. 54
        Because a project contributes to the renewable energy learning curve that will make
         the technology in question the least-cost way of achieving carbon emission reductions
         in the future. These are projects where even if all relevant externalities (and
         particularly carbon emission reductions) are monetised and included in the economic
         flows, economic returns are still below the hurdle rate at present technology costs, and
         at present valuations of greenhouse gas (GHG) damage costs. Concentrated solar
         power (CSP) and PV are the main examples here. The challenge for economic analysis
         is to show that such projects contribute to the global learning curve necessary to bring
         about cost reductions in the long run; and to demonstrate a credible case for additional
         macroeconomic benefits that derive from local manufacture of project components.

assessments of the support policy framework as part
of the project preparation work. Even though the recommendations of economic reasoning
regarding support mechanisms have not always been accepted by Governments, bringing these
matters to active discussion have demonstrated the importance of the questions raised, which
in turn led to successful renewable energy projects. Nowhere is this more important than in
the transparent recovery of incremental costs that will determine the sustainability of tariff
support instruments. There are several issues that deserve attention in such a policy review:

        Targets: RE projects are often proposed on grounds that they are required to meet
         Government targets. The main question is whether such targets have been derived on
         the basis of standard economic reasoning (intersection of the RE supply curve with the
         full social cost of thermal generation, including their environmental damage costs), or
         are they merely an aspirational goal (see Technical Note M3, Supply Curves). The
         credibility and longevity of targets has come under increasing question in many
         countries, yet credible commitments to introduce a new technology are vital to
         attracting local investment into manufacture of components.
        Energy sector context: power sector options need examination in a broader context of
         energy policy and low-carbon development. A good example is biomass utilisation for
         power generation, which may in fact increase national GHG emissions. For example in
         Vietnam, rice husk is extensively used in rural industry (brick making, ceramics) where
         it displaces oil and coal. But if used for power generation then it will displace the most
         expensive thermal generation, which (in Vietnam) is gas CCGT (whose gas price is
         linked to Singapore fuel oil prices). A feed-in tariff high enough to enable biomass
         power generation will drive up rice husk prices (as occurred in Thailand), pushing

         rural industry back to oil and coal, whose GHG emissions are higher than those from
         the gas power projects displaced by biomass electricity generation.
        Policy instruments: a wide range of policy instruments are in use, but often their
         design is not economically rational. In mandatory green purchase requirements
         imposed on distribution companies, penalties for non-compliance are often completely
         arbitrary (made worse by arbitrary targets and quota sizes).
        Incremental costs: Where targets are aspirational, they are often set without any effort
         to estimate the incremental costs. In the CRESP project, the Government acted in full
         knowledge of the incremental costs of large scale wind power development when
         setting the tariff support mechanism; by contrast, the 2012 Indonesian feed-in tariff and
         the various targets set by the Government for geothermal projects, were issued without
         any analysis of the incremental cost and the impact on MoF that was to provide the
         necessary subsidy (see Technical Note C6, distributional analysis). The extent to which
         buyers - whether provincial distribution companies, or large vertically integrated
         utilities - can treat RE power purchases as pass-throughs is a frequent question (and
         often determines the extent of opposition of such buyers to renewable energy).
        Willingness to pay for mitigation of global and local externalities. The question of
         whether a relatively poor country should value carbon at levels far in excess of the
         value in the world’s carbon markets arises frequently ($30/ton CO2 according to the
         World Bank’s current Guideline, as against the present $10/ton CO2 price the EU
         carbon trading scheme).
        Rationality of support tariffs: Economic reasoning holds that tariffs should reflect the
         economic costs of supply. When setting an avoided cost tariff its build-up (of the
         various benefits) should reflect the same line items as used in the table of economic
         flows used in CBA. In competitive systems, benefit-based tariff ceilings (whether
         published or not) serve to ensure that winning bids do not exceed benefits.55 Such
         economic reasoning conflicts with the widespread use of feed-in tariffs based on the
         estimated production costs of the IPP which are preferred by developers (but whose
         principal interest is adequate revenue, not economic efficiency).
        Competition: Competitive tendering of IPPs is generally the preferred approach, but
         this again conflicts with fixed feed-in tariffs – which forces developer selection into one
         of several inferior options (first come-first served or beauty contests, neither of which
         ensure economic efficiency in project selection). On the other hand, transaction costs
         dictate that small projects be exempted from competition – so the question becomes
         one of setting an appropriate threshold.
        PPA: Many Bank renewable energy projects involve on-lending through local banks in
         support of portfolios of qualified renewable energy subprojects. The worldwide
         experience is that a standardised PPA is always preferable to ad hoc project by project
         negotiation. And even where IPPs are selected by competitive tender (e.g., Indonesia
         geothermal), the tariff schedules of the PPA should be fixed at time of tender (to avoid
         interminable post-award negotiations on escalation and indexation).
        Institutional Issues: A range of issues need assessment, including the human resource
         issues associated with staffing and leadership of RE units in Ministries; how to define
         the role of the state (for example in countries with geothermal resources, defining the
         role of the State in up-front exploration); the extent to which resource data should be in
         the public domain; and the need for enabling legislation, among others. While these
         are not directly matters of economic analysis in project appraisal, they will determine
         the extent to which economic reasoning can be brought to bear on decision-making.
        Procedures for support tariff implementation: A rational tariff-setting process –
         involving regular review, stakeholder consultation, and a published methodology – is
         vital for a successful RE program, particularly from the perspective of lender-
         confidence in cash-flow forecasts. Even where independent electricity regulators (or
         Public Utility Commissions) are not part of the institutional framework, entities housed
         within Ministries of Energy can provide leadership for tariff reform, and promote a

55       Such an approach is now in place (since June 2014) in Indonesia for competitive tenders to select geothermal
         developers (and which replaced the fixed feed-in tariff of 2012).
September 2015                                                                                                   28
        rational mechanism for the promulgation and regular review and adjustment of
        renewable energy support tariffs (For example, in Vietnam, the Electricity Regulatory
        Authority of Vietnam (ERAV), a unit of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, has been

variable wind and solar generation into grid
operations is challenging: since wind and solar generation only occur when wind and solar
resources are available, their output is not controllable. Grid operators are accustomed to
dealing with variability, but primarily on the load side. The challenge is that higher levels of
wind and solar generation add both variability and uncertainty.
103.     Several countries—notably Denmark, Germany, Portugal, and Spain—are providing
real-world experience in integrating high levels of variable generation, primarily wind power.
In addition, several integration studies have modeled and simulated the addition of large
amounts of wind, and to a lesser extent, solar generation to the grid. Such studies provide
valuable information on the expected impacts of high levels of variable energy generation and
potential strategies for successfully integrating variable energy generation into the system.
These studies look at the technical operational impacts of integrating these resources into the
systems and the potential technical and economic implications to system operations, notably
short-term, reserve-related costs. Globally, variable renewable generation sources still
represent mainly an energy rather than a capacity resource. While their contributions to
capacity or “firm? power and associated costs are different from those of conventional power
sources, variable renewable generation technologies can contribute to long-term system
adequacy and security. Several lessons learned can be gleaned from both operating experiences
and integration studies. The best summary of this experience is Madrigal & Porter. 56
104.     Where a good capacity expansion planning model is available, the capacity credit can
be assessed by examining the capacity expansion plan with and without the project – the model
will determine how much other capacity is actually displaced – some units will be delayed,
some eliminated completely – though even here the user has to input the firm capacity of a RE
project at the time of peak demand (which for many RE technologies may be quite small). But
where such a model is not available, the best approach is to treat energy benefits and capacity
benefits separately, rather than just compare on the basis of levelised cost of energy (against the
counterfactual) - and then calculate the switching value for the extent of capacity credit
required to reach the hurdle rate (see example in Technical Note T4).
105.    Wind projects in particular impose a range of system integration costs that arise as a
consequence of the highly variable output. These costs will be a function of the scale of wind
penetration: the greater the fraction of penetration, the greater the potential difficulty in

accommodating the variability. A 100 MW wind project connected to the 30,000 MW Java-Bali
grid in Indonesia can be accommodated with little difficulty; but a 10 MW wind project on a
small eastern island heretofore served by a 20 MW of diesel may impose a range of additional
system costs that need to be reflected in a CBA. An excellent starting point for understanding
the integration of wind in small diesel systems is Garrad Hassan. 57
106.    The impact of wind power depends not just on the wind power penetration level, 58 but
also on the power system size, the seasonal and daily variation patterns, transmission network
topology, generation capacity mix (particularly the proportion of storage and pumped storage
hydro), the degree of interconnection to neighbouring systems, and load variations. In short,
the problem is complex, and therefore plausible quantification of network integration costs
generally goes beyond the competence of the (average) project economist. For non-engineers,
Romero59 is an excellent introduction.
107.     The costs imposed on the buyer of intermittent energy include the following 60:
 Cost of additional firm capacity needed to counter the seasonal and inter-annual
     variability.
 Increased O&M costs at existing thermal units called upon to ramp output levels over a
     broader range and more often and with shorter notice.
 The heat rate penalties (and related fuel costs) associated with such increased ramping
 Regulation costs (that arise from the intra-hour variability of wind resources that requires
     additional fast response capacity be available).
 Systems operations cost (that arise from less than optimal operation of the system as a
     consequence of the uncertain nature of wind energy production).
 Gas storage costs (that arise from inaccuracies in the amount of gas nominated each day,
     which may require the need to inject or withdraw gas from storage at short notice).
 Large-scale grid-connected battery storage which still remains very expensive and is not
     currently available at a commercial scale (though these costs are expected to decline in the
     future, possibly quite rapidly).
Technical Note T1 discusses and summarises the order of magnitude of incremental system
integration costs as reported in the literature.
108.     Power utilities will often raise a long list of technical problems associated with network
stability that are difficult for an economist to assess, and the technical engineering experts
brought in by the TTL will often be reluctant to give precise estimates in light of uncertainties,
especially where detailed system studies have yet to be performed: this is frequently the case at
the time when support tariffs are being discussed by Government, and the utility has no prior
experience with wind projects. Often the main question (and the fo cus of the buying utility’s
main objection to wind power) is how the incremental transmission connection costs are to be
financed (see Technical Note T2). The project economist’s role is to insist that plausible
integration costs are developed: even so, very often the only recourse is to include a generic
estimate of costs from the informed literature, and treat this as one of the variables in the
sensitivity analysis and risk assessment of economic returns.

(grid-connected) thermal generation that is the next best alternative to the project.

110.     In the case of substitution benefits, the impact on electricity consumers derives from
any change in tariff: other things equal, a renewable energy project with high incremental costs
will result in an increase in tariff (and a loss of consumer surplus); a renewable energy project in
the least cost plan (for example a hydro project that would displace a gas CCGT) will result in a
decrease in tariff (and an increase in consumer surplus). Because many of the Bank’s clients
have electricity tariffs that are far from cost-reflective, the incremental costs of renewable
energy are often absorbed by Governments through additional subsidy to utilities.

111.      A geothermal project on a remote Indonesian island grid previously served (poorly)
only by diesels for just a few hours a day may bring 24-hour power, and significant additional
electricity consumption. The same is true of some hydropower projects whose main rationale
is alleviation of power shortages in peak hours (as in the case of the Tarbela T4 extension
project). In such cases the incremental benefits are assessed on the basis of willingness-to-pay
(WTP) derived from demand curves based on household surveys. Technical Note M2
discusses further the implications of the choices for valuation, and the problems of using
survey-based willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates.

The impact of renewable energy tariff design
112.     Good tariff design can influence the technical design of renewable energy projects.
Most flat rate feed-in tariffs (FITs) (based on estimates of production costs) provide little
incentive to design projects that maximise peak hour generation and provide capacity benefit
to the grid. For example in the case of small hydro, a tariff specified simply as USc/kWh gives
no incentive for developers to propose high-head, daily peaking projects that require relatively
little pondage to achieve this. However, the experience of Vietnam demonstrates that
developers will respond to time-of-day and time-of-season generation tariffs to propose daily
peaking projects that have much greater benefits than pure run-of-river projects. (The
Vietnamese avoided cost tariff for small renewable energy producers offers a substantial
premium for energy produced during the peak hours of the dry season). 61

Portfolio diversification
113.    It may well be true that a single small hydro project, or a single wind turbine, has no
(or very little) capacity value. But a portfolio of small hydro projects spread across several
catchments may provide a significant capacity benefit through spatial diversification. And
there are many countries where a portfolio consisting of wind and small hydro can diversify
the seasonal output (for example, as shown in the CRESP studies for Zhejiang, where a

portfolio of small hydro peaking in wet summers and wind peaking in winter matches well the
annual load curve).62 Such system benefits are often overlooked when appraising just a single
project. Technical Note T1 discusses this issue further.

115.    A useful demonstration of the plausibility of a renewable energy project is to examine
the proposed project’s position in the renewable energy supply curve. The construction of such
supply curves, and how to avoid some of the pitfalls, are discussed in Technical Note M3.

116.    Although one can generally recommend the use of capacity expansion planning
models such as WASP and EGEAS to assist in the development of the counter-factual, the
contribution of firm energy from intermittent renewables has to be determined exogenously by
the user – so caution is required: the economist would be wise to consult with the Bank’s power
systems planning experts to assess the credibility of claims about the firm capacity contribution
of VRE.

118.    The rationality of renewable energy tariffs is thus of major importance to an economic
analysis. Of necessity, many PADs discuss the arrangements for RE tariffs, but caution is
needed in how that discussion is framed. From the perspective of economic efficiency, the
optimum level of renewable energy is given by the intersection of the renewable energy supply
curve with the social cost of thermal generation (i.e. including consideration of all local
externalities), and with due consideration of adjusting supply curves for capacity penalties.
The ideal tariff is therefore set at this level, and ideally the marketplace best decides what mix
of technologies can achieve carbon emission reduction at least cost. Unfortunately this ideal is
not always appreciated by the Bank’s client countries.
119.    Yet technology-specific and above all generous feed-in tariffs based on estimated
production costs are popular around the world precisely because they have been demonstrated
to achieve ambitious MW targets for wind and solar installed capacity. But for developing
countries where the new Bank economic analysis guidelines now make clear that the prime
focus should be the development benefits of a project, any feed-in tariff that lies above the
avoided social cost of thermal generation needs careful justification, and a PAD should provide
clear demonstration of why incremental costs above the optimal tariff are justified, and how
they should be recovered.
120.    This is no different to the general aspects of electricity tariff design, where deviations
from the optimal electricity tariff require careful justification. Lifeline tariffs reflect a valid
Government objective, and some degree of deviation from the economic optimum for sake of
equity is a trade-off for Government to make. But the targeting performance (i.e. what
proportion of the subsidy provided is captured by the intended beneficiary) always needs
assessment.

122.      Such macroeconomic benefits as derive from domestic manufacture of RE equipment
have been proposed for several CSP and wind projects. But we know of only one study that is
of sufficient credibility to allow inclusion of macroeconomic benefits in the economic accounts

64      The South Africa Medupi coal project illustrates the problem. The economic analysis showed that even
        leaving aside any additional capacity costs to offset the lack of firm capacity of wind projects, to produce the
        same energy at the Medupi coal project would require an additional $20billion of investment capital, far in
        excess of the carbon finance (of around $1billion) actually available to South Africa (see Table M5.8,
        Technical Note M5).

of a major renewable energy project – that for Morocco, prepared under the auspices of the
Bank’s MENA CSP initiative.65

123.     The main issue is that these macroeconomic benefits are almost always contingent on
the assurance of a sufficiently large domestic market to justify the necessary private investment
in domestic manufacturing facilities which will generate the macroeconomic benefits. That in
turn translates into the credibility of Government commitments to supporting a particular RE
technology. Few industrialists will be persuaded on the basis of aspirational renewable energy
targets (by 2020, so many percent of power generation from renewable energy): what is needed
are plausible and enforceable institutional and pricing reforms. In Morocco the Government
has backed up its targets with the establishment of a strong agency (MASEN) to implement
solar projects, and to provide credible financial backing: but elsewhere supporting policies are
often weak. The practical question for the project economist would be whether project
preparation funds are sufficient to include a high quality study of potential macroeconomic
benefits for the country in question.      Technical Note T5 further discusses macroeconomic
spillovers of renewable energy.

10.   Distributional      Are the incremental costs of high-cost VRE identified, and does the
      analysis             analysis show who bears them (providers of concessionary finance,
                           electricity consumers, or Government) (C6)
11.   Sensitivity         In the case of intermittent renewables, does the sensitivity analysis show
      analysis             the relationship between capacity credit and economic return? (T1)
12.   Risk                Have the risks uniquely associated with natural resource variability
      Assessment           (hydrology risk, wind speed variability, solar insolation variations) been
                           adequately presented and characterised as probability distributions (M7)

13.   Scenario and        Are trade-offs between costs and environmental indicators to show win-
      trade-off            win options and trade-offs considered (M6)
      analysis
14.   Need for            If energy security benefits are claimed, are plausible arguments presented
      additional           that even in the absence of the renewable energy project, the Government
      studies              is taking actions to enhance energy security by reducing the potential
                           impact of physical interruption (increased fuel stocks, petroleum reserves)
                           or by reducing the impact of fuel price volatility (reduce subsidies on
                           fossil fuels, cost reflective tariffs)? (C7)
                          Are the claims for learning curve benefits presented in proper context
                           (i.e., that they do not benefit the project under appraisal, but are mainly
                           relevant to the rationale for Bank involvement in financing)? (T3)

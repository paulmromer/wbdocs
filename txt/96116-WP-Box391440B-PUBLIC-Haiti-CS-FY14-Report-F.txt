II. Methodology
In May, 2014, 409 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Haiti were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial departments, or implementation agencies;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; project management
units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 204 stakeholders participated in the survey (50% response rate).
Some respondents received and returned questionnaires through courier. Others received a link
to an online version of the questionnaire in the Qualtrics platform. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Haiti; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Haiti; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing in Haiti.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Haiti: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Haiti is headed in
    the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important development
    priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
    generating economic growth in Haiti, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.

B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG and other regional development banks, their effectiveness in
   Haiti, WBG staff preparedness to help Haiti solve its development challenges, WBG’s local
   presence, WBG’s capacity building in Haiti, their agreement with various statements

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG) (continued):
   regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the
   most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Haiti, in which sectoral areas the
   WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts. Respondents were also asked to
   indicate which groups the WBG should collaborate more with in Haiti to ensure better
   development results.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Haiti, the extent to which the
   WBG meets Haiti’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the importance
   for the WBG to be involved in thirty six development areas, and the WBG’s level of
   effectiveness across twenty seven of these areas, such as education, policy sector
   governance/reform, job creation/employment, and health.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG’s speed in disbursing funds,
   and whether the WBG takes decisions quickly in Haiti.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Haiti: Respondents were asked to indicate what
   the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Haiti, and which services the Bank
   should offer more of in the country. They were asked whether WBG has moved to the right
   direction, and the future role international development cooperation should play in Haiti.
   Respondents were asked to indicate the areas in which Haiti would benefit the most if the
   WBG plays a leading role among international partners, and the areas in which Haiti would
   benefit the most from other donors in Haiti.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, the language in which they prefer to receive information from
   the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites. Respondents were also
   asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information policy, were asked to rate
   WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social media channels, and levels
   of easiness to find information they needed.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Haiti, which WBG agencies they work with, whether IFC and the Bank work well
   together, and their geographic location.

Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
       There were significant stakeholder differences in their ratings for the WBG’s
        effectiveness in a few development areas.
                  Respondents from PMUs and contractors/consultants working on WBG
                   projects had the highest ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in “regulatory
                   framework? and “job creation/employment,? whereas respondents from the
                   media had significantly lower ratings.
                  Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies had the highest ratings for
                   the WBG’s effectiveness in “disaster management/climate resilience,?
                   whereas respondents from the media again had significantly lower ratings.
                  Respondents from CSOs had the highest ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness
                   in “financial markets? whereas respondents from private sector/financial
                   sector/private banks and the media had significantly lower ratings.
           Respondents from outside Port-au-Prince had significantly higher ratings for the
            WBG’s effectiveness in “regional conflict and tensions,? “domestic private sector
            development,? and “financial markets? than respondents from Port-au-Prince.
       Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 63) that primarily
        informed stakeholders responded to this question.

         institution’s effectiveness in certain areas. Respondents who had no exposure to the

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Haiti, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-seven specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Haiti. The areas determined
        to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at energy;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster management/climate resilience;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at natural resource management.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Haiti, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at energy;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at health/communicable/non-communicable diseases;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at natural resource management; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at domestic private sector development.

IX. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Haiti (continued)
Collaborating with Other Groups
       It is worth noting that respondents from the Office of President/Prime Minister/Ministers,
        employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies, and the private
        sector/financial sector/private banks were most likely to indicate that the WBG should
        collaborate more with the “private sector,? whereas respondents from the media and
        bilateral/multilateral agencies were significantly less likely to indicate so.
       Respondents across stakeholder groups all seemed to stress the importance of
        collaborating more with academia/think tanks/research institutes for the WBG in Haiti in
        the future.

This toolkit was originally developed in response to a request from the Public Sector and Institutional
Reform Cluster (ECSP4) of the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region for the assessment of Treasury Single
Account (TSA) operations in Kyrgyz Republic in October 2012. Its transformation into a generic TSA rapid
assessment toolkit was supported by the Governance and Public Sector Management Practice (PRMPS)
of the World Bank‚Äôs Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Network. The toolkit was
shared with a number of government officials, and project teams for field testing, and to benefit from
additional feedback for possible improvements since then.

The author of this technical note, Cem Dener (PRMPS, World Bank), wishes to thank the numerous World
Bank staff and government officials commented on the toolkit since its introduction in 2012. This
document also benefited from the feedback received from the Financial Management Information
Systems (FMIS) Community of Practice (CoP) members. Comments and clarifications from Ms. Megan
Gray contributed substantially to the second version of this toolkit. The toolkit will be posted on the FMIS
CoP website (https://eteam.worldbank.org/FMIS) for further comments and suggestions, and maintained
through regular updates to reflect the changes in TSA practices or country needs in the future. The
findings, interpretations, and conclusions expressed in this volume do not necessarily reflect the views of
the World Bank.

Introduction
Treasury Single Account (TSA) is one of the proven practices in improving the payment and revenue collection
systems, and carrying out consistent control of public expenditures by centralizing the free balances of
government bank accounts. The TSA infrastructure is usually implemented as a part of the Financial
Management Information System (FMIS) solutions.
This rapid assessment toolkit is designed to assist the government officials in clarifying the current status of
TSA operations, and identifying possible improvements in practices/processes, regulations, information
security, and payment systems. The key purpose of this exercise is to ensure that Public Financial
Management (PFM) reforms supported by ongoing FMIS activities are sufficiently focused on the design of
basic TSA processes that improve cash management.
Although there may be country specific variations, the TSA operations are usually managed by the Central
Treasury (CT) or Accountant General (AG) of the Ministry of Finance. A secure interface between the FMIS
and Central Bank (CB) systems is used to automate the TSA operations, based on a specific legal and
regulatory framework. The TSA accounts and the interbank payment systems are usually managed by the
Central/National Bank. Commercial banks and other government entities may also be involved in the TSA
operations. Although this toolkit is focused on a centralized TSA model, the proposed methodology can be
applied to decentralized TSA arrangements as well. Also, the institutional structures of the MoF may not
include a designated unit (like Central Treasury) responsible for all core functions (receipts, disbursements,
reconciliation and cash management). In such cases, this assessment can be performed by all relevant units
to clarify the current status, and the MoF management may wish to consider possible improvements in such
fragmented structures (for effective separation of duties) as a part of PFM reforms.
The toolkit includes 65 questions in five categories as key indicators about the reliability and integrity of TSA
operations, and underlying government payment systems. A risk and controls review is embedded in this
assessment to analyze the information systems, procedures and operational environment. Several financial
and information security audit standards/guidelines were used as references while developing this toolkit
(Annex 1), in addition to the knowledge and experiences of the practitioners on the design and
implementation of TSA operations in World Bank funded FMIS projects. The scoring of features is included
to measure the current status of TSA operations and identify gaps consistently. This assessment
questionnaire (checklist) is expected to provide a quick feedback to all stakeholders involved in TSA
operations on several key aspects, and the discussions on each of these features to determine the impact of
FMIS and TSA on the management of receipts and payments to support cash management improvements is
far more important than the scores themselves.
The TSA principles and preconditions, rapid assessment methodology, and possible options to perform this
assessment are presented in the following chapters. The metrics used in evaluating the current status of TSA
operations, and the template that can be used for the preparation of the rapid assessment report, are also
explained. Finally, several sample forms are presented as annexes to clarify the type of documents and
systems reviewed during such an assessment.
                                                       1
TSA Principles
The main purpose of TSA implementation is to maximize the use of cash resources through concentration
and reduction in float costs. The TSA solutions are designed to capture detailed information about the
government‚Äôs cash resources and spending on a daily basis. However, it is not enough to simply capture
timely information on cash balances and flows, if balances are not immediately available to the Treasury
(because of a lack of formal authority, or due to lengthy accounting and transfers/payment processes). Also,
the ability to forecast cash inflows and outflows and resultant balances on the TSA is essential in improving
cash management. It should be noted that the FMIS platforms can provide reliable information through
properly designed TSA interfaces on most of these key aspects.
There are a number of ways to implement the TSA depending on country specific conditions (regulations,
banking system, electronic payment system (EPS) arrangements, etc.). In many countries, ‚Äúcentralized TSA
operation‚Äù is preferred to monitor the daily collections and spending promptly and cost effectively (Annex
3). In order to achieve this, a reliable TSA infrastructure1 needs to be established before the implementation
of FMIS solutions (it is usually more difficult and costly to introduce TSA after the development of FMIS),
based on a mutually agreed TSA Protocol2 (between the CT and the CB). Daily data exchange through secure
linkages with the banking system, and the EPS operations is crucial to ensure timely and reliable reporting on
all government revenues and expenditures. Coverage of the Central Bank‚Äôs branch network is also a key
consideration.
In centralized TSA model, the Central Bank is expected to provide a number of payment services
(disbursements to beneficiaries via RTGS and/or ACH; real-time access to account statements) beyond simply
just the custody of the TSA accounts and bulk transfers of funds. In some cases, the Central Bank may be
willing to disburse high-value, low-frequency payments via RTGS, but unwilling to process ACH files (e.g. for
payroll) or to print cheques. Therefore, the TSA model will likely involve commercial bank distribution
accounts for lower-value payments.3 Other banking services that should be considered include: provision of
bank statements/online access to transaction data and account balances; foreign currency payments ‚Äì
sourcing the required forex and delivery to the (generally offshore) beneficiary; letters of credit; electronic
collections (e.g. point-of-sale, payment gateways for online payments); purchasing or payment card schemes
for lower value payments (petty cash, fuel cards, etc.). In some countries the Central Bank may also perform
a ‚Äòquasi‚Äô cash management role on behalf of the government, and provide a short-term lending or overdraft
facility to Government, and this may complicate negotiations on the TSA arrangements.



1
    The term ‚ÄòTSA infrastructure‚Äô refers to the structure of bank accounts in the TSA model and the receipt and
    disbursement flows through these accounts, together with necessary system interfaces and relevant ICT
    components. It is strongly recommended that this model is decided prior to the configuration of the FMIS, and that
    the procedures in support of the TSA are implemented alongside the FMIS implementation.
2
    Initially, such a protocol may include the design of receipt and disbursement processes based upon an assessment
    of the banking services required by government, and identify which of those services the Central Bank is able to
    provide to the government. The protocol can be expanded through an iterative procedure ‚Äì the proposed receipts
    and disbursement processes will determine the banking services government requires, which will in turn guide the
    appropriate TSA model and the structure of bank accounts. Also, the time that will be required to fully negotiate the
    agreement between the CB and Government covering all aspects should not be underestimated.
3
    If the Central Bank is unwilling to provide some or all of these services, then it may be determined that a national or
    commercial bank is better placed to take custody of the TSA (with appropriate risk management and collateralization
    to mitigate against the risk of loss of public funds).
                                                           2
In general, the Central Treasury (CT) operates the TSA for managing all public expenditures in ‚Äúclient account‚Äù
mode, where the Central Bank (CB) executes all payments (indirect participation) on behalf of the CT.
Alternatively, the CT may become a direct participant of the interbank systems (RTGS4 and ACH5) operated
by the CB (‚Äúcorrespondent account‚Äù mode), if specific conditions can be met (related to the information
security, procedures, authorized personnel, and oversight mechanisms). To monitor the collection of
revenues, the CT usually receives daily information from agent (commercial) banks (sometimes through CB),
or revenue administration(s) about the details of transactions through interfaces between the FMIS platform
and these external systems.

TSA Preconditions
The Treasury Single Account preconditions are summarized below (Table 1). This table can be used to provide
an overview of the current status of TSA as a part of the rapid assessment report. Country specific technical
and adaptive (non-technical) challenges can be listed under eight categories to highlight the priorities in
developing or improving the TSA infrastructure.

Note: TSA preconditions are based on model the suggested in Pattanayak, 2010.

It should be noted that a key consideration is legal authority for opening official bank accounts6 (which is also
critical in determining ability to prepare and maintain a reliable inventory of bank accounts). A further

    ACH = Automated Clearing House solution (see Annex 3).

    The IMF paper indicates that these pre-conditions does not refer to Banking and Payment System Laws, but rather
    to the PFM framework (e.g. that the legal authority for opening official bank accounts is vested in the MoF).
                                                         3
consideration is whether the legal framework (which may include procurement laws and regulations)
provides for a centralized procurement of banking services by the Treasury.
Regarding the ICT infrastructure, this preliminary assessment can be used to identify the constraints to
sustainability as well (e.g. the capacity of IT teams to stay abreast of developments and emerging threats;
the existence of a maintenance plan for ICT infrastructure and availability of budget funds).
The primary information system of the CB is its own Core Banking System. While payment systems (RTGS and
ACH) provide reports of transactions, their primary purpose is funds transfer. A key question in the design of
the interface between the FMIS and the Central Bank is whether the interface is just between the FMIS and
the CB‚Äôs Core Banking System (with the CB‚Äôs core banking system interfaced to RTGS/ACH), or if there will be
a direct interface from the FMIS to RTGS and/or ACH (with the transaction information from these systems
reflected back to the CB‚Äôs Core Banking System for maintenance of account positions and production of bank
statements for Government‚Äôs accounts).
It is also important to note that, a TSA arrangement has been achieved without a fully automated interface
between the FMIS and CB systems in some countries.7
In relation to TSA, the key feature of the Chart of Accounts (CoA) is that any information currently provided
through separate bank statements is now to be reported through the CoA classification structure. This must
be recognized from the outset in designing the CoA for FMIS. The CoA should support a hierarchical structure
to exercise budgetary controls at a higher-level, and manage all expenditures to be accounted for at lower
levels.
The inventory of bank accounts should cover all accounts, even those that will be closed during
implementation of the TSA. The ability of the MoF to construct a comprehensive inventory will rest upon the
legal framework, and whether authority to open bank accounts is given solely to the MoF. If a reliable
inventory of bank accounts cannot be compiled, this in itself is cause to move ahead with the TSA reform
(that there are government bank accounts that are hidden or unknown to the MoF is a key challenge to
transparency and suggests weakness in fiscal data). New processes should ensure that funds are not
transmitted to hidden or unknown government bank accounts, and only to those accounts that are
recognized as part of the TSA structure.
The capacity development of the TSA users should commence at the initial stages of reforms, and continue
during and after implementation.
The political support is a continuous issue through the TSA reform and there should be a communications
strategy that sustains political support through the implementation, to overcome resistance due to perceived
power arising from control of own bank accounts.
As with the protocol with the Central Bank, many of these preconditions may suggest related reforms that
could be undertaken to improve TSA arrangements. However, this should not prevent progressing on
implementation of cash centralization through TSA solutions.

    An example of this model is Afghanistan - the paper-instructions printed from FMIS are signed by the Treasurer and
    submitted to the CB. A checklist of payments is also submitted separately to the CB, and all instructions received are
    verified against the checklist prior to being processed. While an automated interface is optimum to prevent risk of
    error, a centralized TSA can still be implemented without such an interface ‚Äì regular, timely bank reconciliation and
    follow up on discrepancies are (as in any model) critical.

TSA Roles and Responsibilities
Regardless of the mode of TSA operations (direct/indirect participation), there should be clear separation of
roles and responsibilities for the treasury, banking and accounting functions, as well as the oversight of
payments and settlements. Below template can be used to clarify these country specific roles and
responsibilities (Table 2) for centralized TSA model, as a part of the rapid assessment report. For
decentralized TSA models, other key actors should also be considered (such as revenue collectors and
spending agencies, as well as the debt management function if it is outside the CT).

Reliability and Integrity of TSA Records
The reliability and integrity of TSA operations depend on several key requirements related with the daily
recording / reporting of all revenues (receipts) and expenditures (payments):

  ÔÇÑ A bank statement containing all the details about the flow of funds in the TSA should be generated
      directly by the Central Bank information systems, independently from the Central Treasury (as the
      organization managing payments). Such bank statements should be available to the CT for automated
      reconciliation through the FMIS General Ledger (GL) module on a daily basis. If the Central Treasury is
      a direct participant of the interbank payment systems, there must be absolute assurances that such
      bank statements are generated directly from the interbank payment systems, and supported by
      consistent information from the Central Bank GL.
  ÔÇÑ FMIS accounting module (GL) should maintain full cash book records for the TSA bank accounts. All
      TSA transactions must be accounted for in the FMIS by the appropriate source (e.g. it may be the
      revenue collectors, rather than the CT, that enter the transactions for revenues deposited to the
      revenue transit accounts in commercial banks, but then the CT accounts for the sweeping of the
      balances from these transit accounts to the accounts in the CB).
  ÔÇÑ Each TSA transaction must contain a unique identifier which can be used to link the payment or
      receipt to the accounting entries in the CT‚Äôs FMIS GL. The CT should be able to reconcile the CB
      statements on the CT‚Äôs bank account balances and the FMIS GL data, regularly (daily) and promptly,
      benefiting from underlying systems.
  ÔÇÑ No manual interventions. All processes (from initiation to final payment and reconciliation) should be
      automated and run on secure platforms.
These requirements must be audited on a regular basis.
Some of the key questions related to the TSA preconditions, as well as the risks and controls are listed in
Annex 4.

The TSA assessment toolkit is composed of 65 questions grouped under five categories:
    1. Legal and regulatory framework of TSA operations (11 questions)
    2. TSA processes and interbank systems (25 questions)
    3. Capacity and competencies (7 questions)
    4. Information security controls (14 questions)
    5. Oversight mechanisms (8 questions)
A simple rating scale (0 to 4) is used for all questions/statements, and the total score is converted into a grade
(0 to 100) as an indication of the country‚Äôs performance in TSA operations/payment systems.
Rating:     0 = Non-existent (Lack of any recognizable process. Activity not yet planned/established.)
            1 = Initial / ad-hoc (Issue recognized. Activity planned and approved for implementation)
            2 = Defined process (Activity implemented partially)
            3 = Managed and measurable (Activity effectively operational)
            4 = Optimized (Activity refined to the level of international good practice)

Guidance on Ratings
‚Ä¢ Rating ‚Äú4‚Äù means that the subject activity related with the interbank payment systems and TSA processes
    have been refined to the level of international good practice with continuous monitoring and
    improvements. Information systems: There is an integrated FMIS solution to automate all critical aspects
    of budget execution, including TSA and performance monitoring, providing tools to improve quality and
    effectiveness in PFM.

‚Ä¢ Rating ‚Äú3‚Äù indicates that there are areas in which a country is doing well in interbank payment systems
    and TSA. It is possible to monitor and measure compliance with procedures and to take action where
    processes appear not to be working effectively. Processes are under constant improvement. From
    information systems perspective, FMIS supports the TSA operations fully.

‚Ä¢ Rating ‚Äú2‚Äù indicates that there are areas for improvement. Government should consider devoting
    sufficient resources to ensure that improvements can be quickly made and strategies developed for
    effective implementation of necessary improvements. There are standardized procedures (automation
    of existing practices) communicated through training. It is, however, left to the individual to follow these
    processes, and it is unlikely that deviations will be detected. FMIS supports the TSA operations partially
    (for example monitoring the account balances, without supporting automated payments).

‚Ä¢ Rating ‚Äú1‚Äù means that the entity has recognized that the issues exist and need to be addressed. There
    are no standardized processes; instead there are ad hoc approaches that tend to be applied on an
    individual or case-by-case basis. Government should consider devoting sufficient resources to ensure
    that improvements can be quickly made and strategies crafted for effective implementation. From
    information systems perspective, limited capabilities exist for automation of processes.



                                                      6
‚Ä¢ Rating ‚Äú0‚Äù indicates lack of any recognizable processes. The activity requires immediate attention and
    clear strategy with high-level political commitment. While it does not necessarily imply from a low rating
    that a government has poor public financial management (PFM) systems, it usually does indicate a key
    concern that requires immediate attention.

‚Ä¢ Rating ‚Äún/a‚Äù indicates that the activity cannot be measured and scoring is not applicable. In such cases,
    clarifications should be provided and such activities are not included in the calculation of ratings.

Assessment of performance
The rating calculations suggested as a part of this assessment are expected to assist countries in determining
the strengths and weaknesses in five specific categories listed above.
The percentage rating (0 to 100) for each category (except ‚Äún/a‚Äù scores) is calculated from:

    Control is defined as the policies, procedures, practices and organizational structures designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that business objectives will be achieved and undesired events will be prevented or detected
    and corrected (as defined in CoBIT).
                                                                                7
How to organize the TSA rapid assessment?
This rapid assessment can be performed in two ways:

ÔÇÑ Self-assessment (usually in two days),
ÔÇÑ Joint assessment (one week) of the TSA operations through site visits, interactions with related CT and
    CB units, and a workshop to discuss the results, with support from the World Bank team.
In both cases, two dedicated teams from the Central Treasury/MoF and the Central/National Bank
(sometimes by inviting the commercial banks and solution providers involved in TSA as well) are expected to
meet and review the questions together, collect evidence on specific aspects (legal framework, practices,
competencies, information security, and oversight), and assess the situation jointly to produce a mutually
agreed assessment report. The World Bank team can join to assist in this process, and provide guidance when
necessary.

Suggested approach

    1. Identify the team members who will take part in the rapid assessment of TSA operations (managers,
       operational staff, technical specialists, etc.), and designate the team leaders of the MoF/Treasury
       and Central/National Bank sides (include the list all participants as a part of the rapid assessment
       report).
    2. If there is an ongoing FMIS contract (TSA implementation in progress), the teams are expected to
       review the functional and technical requirements of the TSA interface and operations, as outlined in
       the FMIS contract (also attach these requirements to the rapid assessment report). FMIS supplier
       representatives can be invited to relevant discussions during this process.
    3. Depending on the type of assessment (self-assessment or joint assessment) organize a kick-off
       meeting with the teams to explain the process, introduce the questionnaire, and expected results.
       Prepare a work plan to perform the assessment and organize necessary meetings, as necessary.
    4. Collect necessary information and evidence through interactions with related officials/units. Fill the
       questionnaire, answering all questions and providing ratings based on the evidence. Note all key
       findings and relevant evidence in the comments section of each question.
    5. Organize a workshop with the participation of all stakeholders involved in the rapid assessment to
       discuss the findings and recommendations.
    6. Following the completion of this review process by going through all 65 questions in the
       questionnaire, a TSA Rapid Assessment Report can be prepared, benefiting from the template
       attached in Annex 2 of this guidance note.
This TSA rapid assessment is intended as a joint review of several important conditions, which are expected
to be substantially met to ensure a fully operational and reliable TSA interface. Most of the technical
capabilities can be developed in a relatively short time, as a part of the FMIS implementation. However, high
level political commitment is required for the resolution of TSA related adaptive (non-technical) challenges
in many economies.

Notes:
A
   Regarding Q.1, a key feature to consider would be whether the MoF/Treasury may define standards for systems used in financial management (and the coverage of this
   approval - are extra-budgetary entities included) and what responsibilities are vested in the accountable officers in Ministries for maintaining effective financial management
   systems and internal control frameworks (and therefore in an FMIS architecture). What assurances the MoF/Treasury must provide regarding the operations of the FMIS for
   comfort of these accountable officers in discharging their duties, and conversely, what requirements the accountable officers are charged with for using the FMIS (e.g.
   maintaining operating system and virus protection updates on all workstations connected to the network that connects to FMIS; network security ‚Äì firewalls, monitoring and
   maintenance of logs; not sharing logons and passwords to both the network and the FMIS with anyone else). If there is a secure government-wide network or intranet, these
   features may be addressed in the membership to this network (which may be managed by an entity other than the MoF/Treasury). However in many countries FMIS
   implementation is ahead of government-wide secure network and these issues are addressed during FMIS implementation.

    Q.4 and Q.8: This will impact whether procedures can be fully automated through the system, or the transmission of supporting documents / hard copy authorizations are still
    needed alongside the messages transmitted within the FMIS and from the FMIS to the paying bank. If the legislation governing electronic transactions and communications is
    in place (or is in the process of being drafted), the FMIS design and banking interface must conform to this legislation to ensure electronic transmissions are of equal legal
    standing to a paper-based authorization. For example, if the legislation provides for a public key infrastructure, there may be requirement for the certifying authority to be
    approved by a central regulatory body and therefore the FMIS must deploy certificates from an approved certifying authority. If there are gaps in the legal support for electronic
    signatures and no legal basis for public-key based electronic signatures, centralized TSA processes may need to include additional controls to address this. For example, the
    transmission of the payments file from the Treasury to MoF may involve an additional process where key information about the file (e.g. total value of payments, number of
    payments and a hash total constructed from the sum of the account numbers in the file) is exchanged through a different route (e.g. e-mail, telephone) between the Treasury
    and the Central Bank before the Central Bank approves the file to be actioned through the payment system.

    Q.2 and Q.5: In some cases, these can be covered under a single agreement (the agreement may be developed over time ‚Äì initially it is important to have an agreement related
    to the banking services that the CB will or will not provide).
B
    Key clauses in Banking Legislation, Regulations and Circulars that impact the design of the TSA (custody and structure of bank accounts, and receipt and disbursement processes)
    include:
    ‚Ä¢ Law concerning the Central Bank may specify that the CB has custody of Treasury accounts or is banker / fiscal agent to government;
    ‚Ä¢ The CB Law may specify that CB profits are passed to Government and that the CB is recapitalized by Government in event of a loss (therefore lower risk if custody of the
        TSA is with the CB);
    ‚Ä¢ The availability of credit from the Central Bank to Government;
    ‚Ä¢ The roles and responsibilities of the Central Bank and Government in respect of issuance and servicing of domestic and external debt;
    ‚Ä¢ Payment system operating hours;
    ‚Ä¢ Cheque Clearing periods;
    ‚Ä¢ Clearing periods for electronic transactions (ACH and RTGS);
    ‚Ä¢ Time periods for return of invalid transactions (e.g. Credit to invalid customer account in receiving bank);
    ‚Ä¢ Handling of mis-directed transactions (e.g. Credit to a valid but incorrect customer account);
    ‚Ä¢ Requirement for commercial banks and other financial institutions to report on government accounts, balances and transactions to the MoF/Central Treasury (as noted
        above, this also impacts the ability of MOF to effectively prepare an inventory of existing bank accounts).

                                                                                         16
C
    Q.13: Payment control functions are not limited to compliance with budget limits, and other important aspects of public expenditure controls should also be considered (e.g.
    procurement functions, payroll controls, vendor registration, monitoring imprest bank accounts of spending units). If a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) package is deployed
    as the basis for the FMIS, these controls may be relatively sophisticated to configure and maintain. Therefore, the set-up should be clearly documented, and responsibility for
    maintenance of user roles in the system should be clearly assigned for all controls. Similarly, for locally-developed software, the controls environment must be embedded
    properly in the software functionality and associated data model.

    Q.14: Payment control functions performed by the CB are mainly related to checking invalid payments and returns of instructions and the credit value within the time frames
    specified in legislation / participant rules.

    Q.15 and Q.16: If the CT is carrying out reconciliations, the CT must be maintaining cashbooks for all TSA bank accounts in the processing of the transactions. In countries where
    a structure of bank accounts have been used to account for transactions, the maintenance of cash books and reconciliation may be weak (and in some cases, cash books being
    presented for audit being simply the bank statement with the DR/CRs reversed, as opposed to being maintained). Daily flows must be recorded independently by both the CT
    and the CB to support reconciliations.

    Q.17: While oversight of payment systems is generally a function of the Central Bank, in some countries, the institutional framework is that an entity independent of the CB is
    directly responsible for supervision of financial institutions and/or payment systems oversight (although of course the CB will always be an interested stakeholder). Also, the
    features available in the national payment systems (as opposed to the automation of the oversight of these systems) will impact the design of TSA processes and policies (e.g.
    can Government collect from and pay to a mobile-money account with a telecom?).
D
    Q.23: Transaction reports may be provided from the RTGS and ACH, whereas bank statements are generated from the CB‚Äôs core banking system. Also, it would be pre ferable
    that statements are available online, in real-time as opposed to being transmitted daily.

    Q.25: Please note that the system architecture of some COTS packages is that the bank reconciliation is considered a separate module, or part of the cash management module,
    as opposed to being within the GL module. It is important to ensure that the cash book records used in the bank reconciliation process are complete for any postings to GL
    bank assets.
E
    Q.27-Q.31: There are several layers of ‚Äòaudit trails‚Äô that would be required to effectively trace any transaction (on the database itself, as well as on FMIS application software
    and network access logs). This assessment is mainly focused on the ‚Äòaudit trails‚Äô on relevant databases. A key question is whether the internal and external auditors are fully
    apprised of the audit trail (database and software, and also IT audit for the network logs), and able to use this to trace the processing of transactions ‚Äì in some countries, only
    the FMIS system administrator understands how to use the audit trail function for tracing transactions (and therefore no one has the ability to trace system administration
    actions). Another key question is whether government has access (internally or through lo cal/regional firms) to a ‚Äòforensic‚Äô accounting capability that would be able to trace
    any transaction or data entry made through FMIS. These important aspects should also be noted for a more comprehensive assessment, where applicable.
F
    The information security controls listed in this part are focused on the electronic payment process. In practice, this extends back to the initiation of purchase orders in spending
    agencies and changes made to payroll/employees (as these are the first stage payments that will be processed through the TSA). As discussed above, where the network for
    the FMIS has been implemented by the MoF and enables connections to other local networks maintained by the spending agencies, information security controls must be
    applied across all elements (including the spending agencies networks which the MoF is not directly responsible for maintaining), not just in the CT or CB.
G
    Please note that the IMF Safeguards Assessment is only required in countries that are using fund resources, although is encouraged for countries under a staff-monitored
    program as well.

Annex 3.          Overview of Centralized TSA and Electronic Payment Systems

Treasury Single Account (TSA) implementation arrangements can be broadly grouped under two categories:
centralized and distributed. The centralized TSA arrangement is designed to capture all revenue and
expenditure transactions through a consolidated structure of bank accounts in a single financial institution,
generally the central bank. When the PFM operations are highly decentralized and the budget spending units
are allowed to retain separate transaction accounts, the distributed TSA arrangement may help in capturing
the flows in these accounts by sweeping the balances into the TSA main account at the end of each day.
However, it is relatively difficult to capture the details of transactions in decentralized TSA. Therefore,
centralized structures are being established in many countries to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
TSA operations through centralized transaction processing. Advances in web-based applications and rapid
expansion of electronic payment systems are the key enablers supporting the centralized TSA operations.
Electronic Payment Systems (EPS) or Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) operates on the basis of two systems:
‚Ä¢   The clearing house system is where transactions between members of a clearing channel are recorded.
‚Ä¢   Settlement is the finalization in a transfer of funds, and is the act that discharges the obligations of banks
    in respect of funds transfers between their depositor accounts. The Central Bank of each country usually
    acts as the primary settlement agent. Settlement can occur immediately on a gross basis (RTGS) or be
    delayed on a net basis (ACH).
Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems are funds transfer systems where transfer of money takes place
from one bank to another on a ‚Äòreal time‚Äô and on ‚Äògross‚Äô basis (Figure 1). Settlement in ‚Äòreal time‚Äô means
payment transaction is not subjected to any waiting period. The transactions are settled as soon as they are
processed. ‚ÄòGross settlement‚Äô means the transaction is settled on one to one basis without bunching or
netting with any other transaction. Once processed, payments are final and irrevocable. In terms of liquidity
and systemic risks, high-value payment systems are the most important due to the large value and time
sensitive nature of the payments. RTGS solutions are mostly implemented by the central banks. The private
sector clearing houses use the Clearing House Interbank Payment System (CHIPS) model.

Automated Clearing House (ACH) system is as a low-value payment system. ACH processes large volumes of
credit and debit transactions in batches and at low cost. ACH credit transactions include payroll, pension, and
annuity payments. ACH debit transactions include consumer bill payments, such as utility bills, phone bills,
and insurance premiums. ACH is mainly operated by the central banks. In some countries the ACH systems
are privately owned and operated, but authorized and regulated by the central banks.
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is a global telecommunications
network. It provides a strict message format for the exchange of financial information between financial
institutions. Messages automatically pass through electronic links built between SWIFT and the local
electronic clearing systems in different countries.
There are two key components to SWIFT:
   ‚Ä¢ The SWIFT network, which is used to transmit messages between SWIFT members (banks and other
        financial institutions); and
   ‚Ä¢ The SWIFT standard messaging format which are internationally-recognized standards for banking
        and financial messages.
SWIFT format messages may be deployed in the TSA payment processes (and is recommended as use of
international standard formats will ease future changes in software applications used), although may not
necessarily be transmitted via the SWIFT network, but via other national payment system networks, or,
through a direct link between the FMIS or electronic payment system and the central bank. The SWIFT
network, however, will generally be the only method for International Telegraphic Transfers.
What is Electronic Payment Center (EPC)? In most cases, the Central Bank (CB) side of the TSA interface is
more developed and robust, and the operations are based on well-defined protocols for secure processing
of electronic payment requests through clearinghouse and underlying payment systems (RTGS/ACH) usually
managed by the CB. Each remote participant of the electronic payment system (e.g., MoF/Treasury, agent
banks) should satisfy specific technical and functional requirements for a reliable connection to comply with
these requirements and become eligible to use specific software.
EPC can be considered as the connection point of this TSA interface on the MoF/Treasury side. It is a secure
room (access control and monitoring system; authorized users) hosting the servers/PCs, backup system, and
network equipment to connect the MoF side of the TSA interface to the Central Bank systems. In some
countries, this secure space is created within the main data center of the MoF as a separate section. In other
cases, it may be a small operator and server room located in related organizational unit and securely
connected to the main data center. Authorized users of the EPC (usually 3-4 specialists and a manager) are
trained by the CB to run a specific software for submitting electronic payment orders to the banking system
directly (correspondent mode) or indirectly (client mode) using digital signature/tokens provided. Daily
operations are recorded (audit trails) and monitored to ensure that the payment orders received from FMIS
are channeled to the CB systems through EPC (no manual interventions), and the statements received from
the banking systems are transferred to FMIS for reconciliation on a daily basis (no manual intervention). Thus,
EPC is a secure central connection point between FMIS and the CB systems to ensure secure transfer of
payment instructions and collecting the results of daily TSA operations electronically. Ideally, all payment
orders created by FMIS and submitted through EPC should have a unique identifier, and the CB system should
record these transaction IDs. Similarly, all payments executed through RTGS/ACH should have unique IDs and
these should be captured back in FMIS database for reconciliation. These unique IDs (one for payment order,
one for executed payments) created and captured on both sides of the interface are needed while auditing
the systems on both sides to ensure one-to-one match of all records stored in both systems. EPC is also the
repository of this information on the MoF side (and they have a backup system to store historic data).

Annex 4.        Questions on TSA Preconditions and Risks

In order to verify the existence of reliable TSA operations and interbank systems, a number of clarifications
can be requested from the CT and CB officials during or before this rapid assessment, to be able to complete
the questionnaire:
 1.   How do the CB information systems capture transaction level data of all movements affecting the
      TSA (for revenues and expenditures)?
 2.   How does the CB maintain and safeguard transaction level TSA data to be available at any future
      point for reporting or audit purposes?
 3.   What procedure will be in place to provide daily bank statements for reconciliation, and who will
      prepare these?
 4.   What are the oversight mechanisms established for monitoring the CB banking operations, as well as
      the CT's treasury/TSA operations (which entity audits treasury and banking operations, and when)?
 5.   Was there any Information and Communication Technology (ICT) security audit performed on CB and
      CT information systems by a certified IT auditor recently?
 6.   Which framework was used in assessing the information systems (COBIT, ITIL, ISO 27001, etc.)?
 7.   Is "audit trail" enabled in relevant databases during daily operations of the CB and CT?
 8.   Which information security controls are actively used in the CB and the CT information systems:
      ‚Ä¢ Authentication and authorization (type of digital signature used; storage of the digital certificates
         issued)
      ‚Ä¢ Privileged access (who has privileged access to TSA databases and interbank system platforms)
      ‚Ä¢ Data security and integrity (solutions for secure data transfer + encryption of data in transit)
      ‚Ä¢ Network and web application firewalls (solutions for reviewing logs, restricting access)
      ‚Ä¢ Password for all user types
      ‚Ä¢ Physical security (access control and data center security)
      ‚Ä¢ Backup and storage (all transactions for the last 5 years stored actively in databases; older records
         are archived; who maintains TSA records)
 9.   Is there an automated process to reflect all daily transactions (revenues + expenditures) in the FMIS
      GL (how to trace the CB interbank system transactions in FMIS GL with unique identifiers)?
 10. What is the operational status of the CT's electronic payment center (number of authorized MoF/CT
     officials to execute payments, and oversight mechanism)?
 11. Data flow diagrams for processing expenditure and revenue transactions through FMIS and CB
     information systems for TSA operations (describing various steps to be supported by CT's FMIS, CT's
     Electronic Payment Center, CB's Access server, CB's RTGS/ACH platforms and the CB's GL).
 12. List of all message formats (for RTGS and ACH separately) to be implemented for recording /
     reporting all budget expenditures and revenues, together with a justification of their purpose.
 13. The latest version of the TSA protocol and its attachments (including financial and information
     security controls).
 14. The Action Plan for the implementation of TSA system (incl. responsibilities of the CT/CB and FB).

A risk and controls review is also included in this assessment to analyze the Central Bank and the Treasury
information systems, procedures and operational environment.
Risk factors that were taken into account during in this review include:
    a) the susceptibility of payment systems and TSA interface to fraud or misappropriation;
    b) complexity of TSA transactions, or degree of reliance on the system to account and reconcile
       correctly;
    c) the degree of manual intervention, and related potential for error involved in the system;
    d) complexity of user security profiles;
    e) interfaces with any third party systems; and
    f)   reliance by the business on the continuing availability of the system.
Controls:
Some of the critical control areas included in this review related with the application based controls,
information systems, and ICT infrastructure are listed below:
    a) Access to CB payment systems and TSA operations (CT‚Äôs electronic payment center) are restricted
       to only those staff whose responsibilities require this access.
    b) Segregation of key TSA and payment system functions are monitored and evaluated regularly.
    c) Input validation to ensure data entry is authorized, accurate and complete.
    d) Regular checks to ensure that all transactions are processed properly.
    e) Output reviews to ensure the completeness, accuracy and validity of reported information and the
       adequacy of audit trails.
    f)   Daily transactions are recorded and reported from both sides of the TSA interface (CB and CT
         information systems) consistently.
    g) TSA system interfaces are designed and tested to protect the integrity of data exchange.
    h) TSA applications are fully understood by staff and comply with the legislation.
    i)   TSA applications are routinely monitored and properly evaluated.
    j)   Physical security to provide an environment that protects hardware and software from damage by
         unauthorized access and environmental effects (e.g. water, extreme temperatures, fire).
    k) Back up of data and offsite storage for system operation recovery.
    l)   Recovery of computer operations in the event of a disaster.

Introduction




               3
The Nairit chemical plant is based in the city of Yerevan and was commissioned in 1936 and possesses
technology for production of 20 types of polychloroprene rubber and latex based on both acetylene
(natural gas based) and butadiene feedstocks. Its key product is synthetic rubber. During the Soviet
times the plant accounted for a large share of global synthetic rubber production. Specifically, in 1987,
the plant accounted for 15% of global supply. The plant was shut down in 1989 and restarted
operations at a smaller capacity in 1993. Several attempts were made to re-commission the plant to
its full capacity, but most of these attempts failed given the underlying economics, i.e. the costs
associated with importing the feedstock butadiene from Russia and the high cost of process energy
given increasing gas import costs. The plant produced some output in early 2000s. In 2006, the plant
was sold to a UK-based company, Rhinoville Property Limited. The plant has not been operational
since 2011 and is in major financial distress.
The objective of this assignment is to assess the technical and technological feasibility and financial
viability of Nairit chemical plant operation. We have considered the operation of the Nairit chemical
plant operation under three different production scenarios:
       12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
       24 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
       25 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via butadiene route

Key Findings and Recommendations
The Government requested the World Bank to assess the technical and financial viability of Nairit
chemical plant operation. This Note presents the key conclusions emerging from the ongoing
assessment, conducted by the Jacobs Consultancy Ltd, and proposes some steps the Government
could take with regard to Nairit.
The ongoing technical, commercial and financial assessment of Nairit indicates that:
    1. The Nairit plant is an unsustainable liability for the Government and continues to be a major
       drain on the Government.1 The plant has not been operational since 2010 when the private
       owner abandoned it. The liabilities of the plant exceed AMD121 billion ($250 million),
       including the sovereign guaranteed loan from the CIS Inter-state Bank, which has not been
       repaid. The company has not generated any revenues and relied on borrowing from Yerevan
       TPP to finance the salaries and maintenance costs since 2010. The total debt of the company
       to Yerevan TPP is AMD23 billion ($48 million), including the payables for steam. If this situation
       is not addressed, Nairit will remain an unsustainable burden for the state-owned power
       companies given that the plant needs about AMD2-3 billion/year ($4-6 million) for salaries
       and maintenance expenses.

        The book value of assets is less than 50% of the outstanding value of debts and payables.
        This means that the company’s assets are not sufficient to meet its liabilities. The current book
        value of property, plant and equipment is AMD57 billion ($119 million). However, a
        substantial share of equipment has significantly deteriorated and this has not yet been
        reflected in the financial statements since stock taking and revaluation of assets has not been
        carried out recently.

    2. The cost of supply by Nairit is estimated to exceed the forecast market price for
       polychloroprene rubber (CR), which makes it uncompetitive globally. The assessment of cash
       costs of PCR production under various processes and technologies (both butadiene and
       acetylene based) suggests that even under the least-cost butadiene-based process, Nairit
       would have one of the highest production costs:
        Under butadiene-based process: due to the high cost of chloroprene monomer
           production based on imported butadiene with a large transportation overhead as well as
           high prices for gas and electricity.

            Under acetylene-based process: due to high costs of electricity and gas, which are among
             the highest in the industry.
        At current and forecast PCR prices, Nairit would not be able to compete globally due to high
        production costs, large expenses to get the PCR to main export markets (e.g. Europe or Asia),
        and the pricing policy of the main competitors. Even if one or two main producers have higher
        costs than Nairit, it would still not be able to compete given: (a) transportation costs of
        $150/ton, which is 5% of the final product price, to get the product to main markets, whereas
        other main exporters have lower export-related costs; (b) the need to recover $210-346
        million of capital costs that will be required to restart the operations, whereas the existing
        large exporters have already recovered the capital costs; and (c) trade policy to protect the
        domestic market in China, one of the largest markets today and in the future.

    3. Unrealistic cost reductions or PCR price increases would be required to make Nairit
       financially viable. For example, a 45% increase of the market price of PCR or a 90% reduction

1
 The responsibility for the Nairit plant falls under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, and it became
a financial burden for the power sector.

                                                       7
       in the price of gas would be required to make Nairit commercially viable under all of the
       production technologies considered.

   4. These technical and financial considerations suggest that the Government should consider
      developing and implementing a liquidation plan. Such a plan should include the key steps
      below:
       Conduct stock taking of assets and assess their current market value. Nairit should hire
          an independent evaluator to carry out stock taking and revaluation of assets, which can
          be sold to meet the liabilities of the plant to its employees, the state budget, and other
          creditors in the order of seniority.
       Negotiate with creditors to settle the outstanding debts, which is most unlikely to be
          redeemed through asset sale. There is a court ruling mandating Nairit to pay to the CIS
          Inter-state bank AMD51 billion ($108 million), including interest and fines.
       Design and implement a social mitigation plan. The Government should ensure the
          retrenched employees are paid a severance package and the existing social safety net
          provides the required redeployment assistance to them.
       Conduct a detailed environmental assessment of the plant. The Government should
          commission a study to conduct a thorough assessment of legacy environmental issues of
          the plant in order to remedy them and allow for environmentally sustainable
          decommissioning.
       Implement the liquidation plan, including environmental clean-up. The Government
          should allocate resources to decommission the plant in an orderly way, including
          addressing environmental legacy issues.
The Government should conduct the steps highlighted above transparently and communicate on this
sensitive issue, so that the information, arguments and justifications behind its decision become
publicly available.

Global Demand, Supply and Trade of PCR
The Global market for PCR has been growing at a pace equal to 1/4th of the global GDP growth rate.
The demand elasticity (ratio of demand growth to GDP growth) was about 0.24 between 2000 and
2014. Overall the product had a low demand elasticity as a result of the deceleration of industrial
output in some large industries using PCR and substitution by other rubbers in industries like
automotive and manufacturing. Historically demand for PCR has always grown more slowly than GDP,
mainly because its end-use industries are not directly linked to the macroeconomic parameters except
for automotive manufacturing. During the forecast period (2015-2040), the major demand for the
product is assumed to come from Asia where the demand is likely to grow owing to the higher demand
from manufacturing segments. Regions like North America and Western Europe, where markets are
already saturated, are likely to contribute less to the global demand.

In the long term, PCR demand is likely to grow at about 1.2% per year, with demand volumes increasing
from 345,000 tons in 2014 to about 423,000 in 2030, with average demand additions of 5,000 tons
per annum. North America and Western Europe are likely to grow at very low rates of 0.3-0.5% in the
long term as demand matures and end-use industries like automotive and adhesive manufacturers
move to lower-cost manufacturing hubs. Asia, as well as Middle East/Africa, is expected to grow at
1.7%, with China leading the growth in Asia.
The global PCR production capacity has been shrinking. In 2014, the global capacity for PCR was
estimated to be 400,000 tons. In 2000-2014, the capacity contracted by 17,000 tons with the shut-
down of major facilities in North America and Western Europe, while some new capacity was added
in Asia either through expansion of existing Japanese plants or construction of new plants in China.
In 2014, Asia accounted for about 60% of the total installed capacity while Western Europe comprised
21% of the total installed capacity. North America constituted about 19%.

Japan is the dominant producer of PCR globally. Japanese producers account for 59% of the global
market for PCR. In the period 2006-2013, the Japanese producers inCReased the capacity by 80,000
tons/year. Since Japan is a net exporter of the product, all capacity additions are aimed mainly at the
export markets. Chinese capacities inCReased by 40,000 tons with the new Chinese/Armenian joint
venture plant, Shanxi Synthetic Rubber Group, starting up its 30,000 tons/year plant in mid-2010 at
half capacity, but gradually inCReasing capacity utilization in subsequent years.

The only North American producer has exited PCR production. In North America, there has been only
one producer, DuPont Dow Elastomers, a joint venture of DuPont and Dow. It shut down one of its
two facilities and sold the other to the Japanese Denka joint venture (Denka 70%, Mitsui 30%).
Germans are the only manufacturer in Western Europe. The German company, Lanxess, has about
83,000 tons/year of capacity, which includes both solid rubber and latex. The only other PCR plant in
Western Europe was in France, a 43,000 tons/year plant owned by Enichem. However, due to poor
economic conditions and other issues, the older Enichem plant was closed down in 2005, and now
Laxness is the sole producer of the product in Western Europe.
Nairit accounted for 3% of the global capacity before discontinuation of production in 2010 . Nairit
used to supply roughly 10,000 tons/year of PCR using acetylene-based process. The butadiene-based
process was not used given feedstock unavailability (Nairit could not compete with domestic demand
for butadiene in the Russian Federation) and costs associated with sourcing butadiene from Russia.

In 2013, Asia accounted for largest share of exports/imports of PCR. Asia was the largest importer of
PCR in 2013 with nearly 83,000 tons imported. Asia was also one of the largest exporters of PCR,
exporting about 100,000 tons in 2013, with Japan accounting for 95% of exports. The Asian region is
more or less a balanced market and will convert to a minor exporter in the forecast years. Japan is
expected to satisfy the demand of China and the rest of Asia.

North America is a net importer and Western Europe is a net exporter. The North American is a net
importer after the closure of its plants. The Western Europe is a net exporter as demand has fallen
within the region. The Middle East, Africa and South America currently have no capacity and hence
are net importers of the product. Due to sporadic production, Eastern Europe has historically been a
net importer.
Foreign suppliers struggle to compete on the Chinese market due to import duties. China is likely to
continue to impose anti-dumping duties on PCR from the European Union, North America and Japan.
China had previously imposed antidumping duties of 2-151% on PCR imported from Japan, the United
States and the European Union for 5 years from May 2005. A fresh probe was undertaken in May 2010
and the duties were imposed for another five years in May 2011.
Any future PCR rubber capacity additions will most likely be directly related to the availability of
both low-cost butadiene and cheap electricity. As butadiene demand in recent years has led to large
price differential between butadiene and butanes (competing output from refineries), efforts are
under way to develop alternative processes for manufacturing butadiene.

Snapshot of Financial Standing of Nairit
Nairit has been idle since 2010 and became a major liability for the Government . The company has
not produced any output since 2010. Although 90% of the company was sold to Rhinoville Property
Limited, the owner left in 2010, saddling the company with a combined debt of AMD90 billion ($188
million) including AMD51 billion ($108 million) to the CIS Inter-state Bank. The debt has been steadily
inCReasing since 2010 due to almost AMD16 billion ($33 million) borrowed from Yerevan TPP to
finance the salaries of the staff, numbering some 2,200 initially, and some basic maintenance
expenses. The number of staff has been brought down recently to around 600, which include mostly
technical personnel. The company also has AMD31 billions ($65 million) of payables with the largest
payables being salaries and energy (steam) from the Yerevan TPP.

Nairit’s assets are not sufficient to meet its liabilities. Nairit has some assets, but the market value is
not known. The balance sheet value of the property, plant and equipment is estimated at AMD57
billion ($119 million), which is significantly lower than the AMD90 billion in debts ($188 million).
However, there has been no re-evaluation of the value of assets and their total market value might be
even lower.

Assessment of Financial Viability of Commercial Operation of Nairit
Production of PCR is not financially viable at Nairit. Although the main product of the plant is PCR,
the production process results in some by-products, the largest being caustic soda, which have value
and can be sold to augment the plant’s revenues (5% of total revenue). The assessment suggests that

production of PCR at Nairit was estimated to be financially not viable for both butadiene3- and
acetylene4-based processes, the two main processes that Nairit can use to produce PCR.

The return on investments is negative for all production scenarios and technologies. The results
suggest that operations are not financially viable irrespective of the annual outputs and associated
economies of scale. Nairit will not generate the required cash flows even assuming that investors
expect only a 10% return on capital, which is below the levels expected for such projects due to: (a)
the country risks and negative macroeconomic outlook; and (b) the higher required rate of return on
capital invested in this project. Such low returns mean that capital investments into this project would
be recovered after 30-35 years, which would be unattractive to investors.
Nairit is among the highest cost producers in the industry due to the high cost of chloroprene
monomer production. The operating profit from unit of PCR sales are low (even negative) under all
production scenarios due to the high cost of chloroprene monomer production, which is the largest
cost item in the PCR production cost structure. Chloroprene monomer is produced either from
butadiene or acetylene.
Butadiene costs are high due to large transport costs, contributing to 20% of the plant gate price .
Butadiene is not manufactured locally and needs to be sourced from abroad. The largest net exporters
with the historically lowest price are the European manufacturers (Germany and the Netherlands).
The European manufacturers are forecast to have the lowest prices for butadiene in the future as well.
If Nairit decides to source butadiene from Europe, the transport costs would be quite high, given the
geographical location and complicated logistics. It is estimated that the cost of butadiene at the Nairit
plant gate would be $1,330/metric ton, with transport cost accounting for 20%. The only technically
feasible way of transporting butadiene from Europe is by: (a) trucks through Russia and down all the
way to Georgia and then Armenia; or (b) rail to Romanian ports first, ferry to Poti next, and finally rail
to Armenia. Maritime transport is not feasible given that the terminals at Georgian ports do not have

the required facilities for handling/temporary storage of butadiene (which loses its useful chemical
properties if it is not constantly in motion).
    -   Imports from Russia, where Nairit historically bought butadiene from, are not feasible. This is
        due to the following reasons: (a) Russia has only two manufactures supplying mostly the local
        market with very limited exports. The outlook for inCReased future capacity of butadiene
        manufacturing in Russia is bleak due to the current economic environment, which is expected
        to delay the projects in the pipeline; (b) shipments from Russia will need to come through
        either rail or ground transport, neither of which is feasible for the foreseeable future given
        the current situation.
    -   Imports from the Esfahan facility in the Islamic Republic of Iran are not certain. Nairit made
        several attempts to reach an agreement with the Iranians. However, it is our understanding
        that the Iranians did not want to enter into a long-term sale agreement given that all of their
        exports have already been committed under long-term contracts.
    -   Imports from the Middle East are not available given that all of the output is committed under
        long-term contracts.
Acetylene-based process is expensive due to its energy-intensity and high cost of energy in Armenia.
The current acetylene-based process at Nairit consumes twice as much gas and 50% more electricity
than butadiene-based process. However, even if Nairit invests in modern acetylene-based processes—
such as BASF and ISP, which would reduce energy consumption—the energy costs will still account for
a large share of the total production costs. Nairit is estimated to have the highest energy cost per ton
of PCR compared to all its competitors.

Nairit is estimated to have one of the highest cost of production among PCR plants. Assuming a
butadiene-based process and annual output of 25,000 tons, Nairit’s cost of production will be the
second highest globally after the Chinese producers. Such high costs of production are due to high
cost of feedstock driven by substantial transportation costs to get it to Armenia and the high cost of
energy (both steam and electricity). Currently Nairit cannot receive steam from the nearby Yerevan
TPP and will have to install a new steam boiler. With investments required and current gas prices of
$277/thousand cubic meters, the cost of steam is going to be quite high. The current electricity cost
of AMD30/kWh8 (which is expected to increase further) is 20-30% higher than for the most of the
competitors.

The cash costs of production based on other processes (acetylene) and technologies (new BASF
technology for acetylene or Plasma Arc technology of ISP) have even higher cash costs and much
poorer financial viability due to high costs of chloroprene monomer production (input into production
of PCR), which means Nairit will not be able to compete with foreign manufacturers.
Most of the existing large producers are located in the largest demand centres. Transportation costs
of the PCR to main markets (e.g. Europe, South America and/or Asia) are prohibitively high. Nairit
could sell up to 10% of the output to Turkey, Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, but it should also
target other large demand centres with above-average growth if Nairit wants to sell all of its
production. However, Nairit will not be able to compete on the Western European or the Asian
markets (let alone in South America with the highest transportation costs).
Specifically, the JV of Japanese/U.S. producers and the German company have the lowest costs of
production and are located in the region in close proximity to the market. Nairit will not be able to
compete in the European market either, given that the largest European producer (Lanxess) has one
of the lowest cash costs and is also located in the demand center, which leads to negligible
transportation costs.

Although China is the most expensive producer, Nairit is not likely to be able to compete on Chinese
market because: (a) it will need to compete with low-cost Japanese producers located very close to
the demand center; and (b) it will need to compete with the Chinese producers which, although having
high production costs, benefits from government protection. Thus, the small share of marginal
demand that Nairit may look to fill is very much dependent on the pricing behaviour of struggling
Chinese producers and the Government policy on market protection (there are already custom duties
in place against low-cost Japanese producers).
Most of the existing large producers have already recovered the capital costs and can aggressively
compete on price. The plants owned by the largest producers have been operating for more than 10-
12 years and have already recovered their capital costs, providing greater flexibility for price reduction
to these producers and putting Nairit at a price disadvantage. For example, even the Chinese Shanxi
Synthetic Group, to which Nairit-2 sold its technology and where the Government of Armenia owns a
stake, is increasingly struggling to compete with the low-cost Japanese PCR producers even on its
domestic market. Nairit will not be able to reduce prices to compete, given the need to recover the
large capital investment that will be required. Nairit will require those investments to upgrade its
facilities. The upgrade costs are different for butadiene- and acetylene-based process, given varying
degrees of dilapidation of equipment used for these processes at Nairit. The capital investment cost
is estimated in the range of $210-346 million, depending on the process and the related capacity of
the plant. The high capital costs are also driven by the need to improve safety and ensure compliance
with environmental standards.

Sensitivity Analysis
Under all of the considered scenarios, the project yields negative project returns. The 25 kta butadiene
based scenario results in the least negative results, followed by 12 kta acetylene based scenario, as
the project generates less absolute negative monies than a larger 24 kta acetylene based scenario. For
the acetylene based cases, the option of using ISP plasma arc process for acetylene generation, yields
the least negative results at current prices for natural gas and electricity. For all cases, the IRR/NPV
figures are based on 20 years of cash flow modelling and the payback estimate is a simple,
undiscounted measure of the payback period.

Polychloroprene Rubber Market Review




                     17
Polychloroprene Rubber Market Overview
Introduction
Polychloroprene Rubber (referred as CR in the report henceforth) was the first commercially produced
synthetic rubber, which was accidentally synthesized by DuPont in 1930. CR is often known by its now
pseudo-generic name ‘neoprene’ – DuPont’s trademark for CR or even ‘polychloroprene’. CR is
produced in both dry rubber (rigid) as well as latex forms. The dry form of CR is used for the
manufacture of industrial and automotive rubber goods like hoses and belts (more often than not as
a CR-linked rubber), while the latex form is used in water based adhesives, dipped goods like gloves
and others. CR is usually available in the form of chips and can be vulcanized by using various
accelerator systems over a wide range of temperatures.
While the market information is generally based on the overall CR demand (i.e. both latex and solid
dry rubber, we have tried to focus on the dry rubber (rigid CR) market segments as was the
manufacturing focus for Nairit in the years prior to shutdown, where possible.
The material properties advantages of CR include:
       Excellent rubber elastic behaviour
       Resistance to weathering, both in dry and humid climates
       Excellent combustion behaviour
       Good resistance to oils
       Aging and heat resistance
       Good tensile strength, tear and wear resistance
       High dynamic fatigue resistance
       Resistance to water and a large number of chemicals over a long period
       Good adhesion to suitably pre-treated reinforcing substrates consisting of textiles, metals or
        glass fibres
       Resistance to fungi and soil bacteria
       Low gas permeability
       Electrical properties sufficient for a large number of applications
CR has thus carved a niche market where at least some of these properties are critical and where other
lower cost elastomers and rubbers cannot fulfil the requirements. More recently polyolefinic
crosslinkable elastomers such as EPDM have been eating away at the low end of the CR markets where
not necessarily all the above properties are required in one application. Other materials such as
Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPEs) and Polyurethane Elastomers have also been successful in taking
away established applications from CR. This trend continues and can be considered still someway
from completion.
The areas where it remains advantaged against the polyolefins competition is in its higher continuous
usage temperature, weatherability and chemical resistance, fatigue resistance, and low gas
permeability.

Manufacturing Process
CR is produced by the polymerisation of chloroprene monomer. There are two methods of
manufacture for chloroprene:
       Acetylene route
       Butadiene route
The Acetylene Route
The older route for the manufacture of chloroprene included the acetylene being dimerized to give
vinyl acetylene, which was combined with hydrogen chloride to form 4-chloro-1,2-butadiene (an
allene derivative), which in the presence of cuprous chloride, forms 2-chlorobuta-1,3-diene
(chloroprene).
The chemical reaction is as follows
HC≡C-CH=CH2 + HCl → H2C=C=CH-CH2Cl
H2C=C=CH-CH2Cl → H2C=CCl-CH=CH2
This process is extremely energy intensive with high investments costs, apart from the environmental
and safety implications of producing and handling acetylene.
The Butadiene Route
In the butadiene route, chloroprene is produced in three steps from 1,3-butadiene – chlorination,
isomerisation and dehydrochlorination of 3,4-dichloro-1-butene.
Chlorine is added to 1,3-butadiene to produce a mixture of 3,4-dichloro-1-butene and 2,3-dichloro-2-
butene. The 2,3-chloro isomer is then isomerized to 3,4 isomer, which in turn is treated with a base to
undergo dehydrochlorination to form 2-chlorobuta-1,3-diene (chloroprene). The chief impurity in
chloroprene prepared in this way is 1-chlorobuta-1,3-diene, which is usually separated by distillation.

Polychloroprene is manufactured by polymerizing the chloroprene monomer. It is possible to
polymerize chloroprene by anionic, cationic and Ziegler-Natta catalysts. However, because of
the product properties and economic considerations, free radical polymerisation is used
which can be carried out in batch as well as continuous process. Using radical initiators,
chloroprene in form of an aqueous emulsion is converted into homopolymers or, in the
presence of co-monomers into copolymers. The polymerization is stopped at the desired
conversion by the addition of a short stopping agent. The latex is freeze-coagulated on large,
refrigerated revolving drums, from which it is drawn as a thin sheet. After washing and drying,

reaction schemes.

The properties of CR depend on various factors including the polymerisation temperatures, monomer
conversion levels and polymerisation aids as well as finishing conditions. Depending on these factors,
physical, chemical and rheological properties of the CR produced can be determined.
Globally, it is estimated that about 40 percent of CR produced is based on the acetylene processes.
These plants are based in Asia, mainly in China and Japan. One of the largest plant of Denki Kagaku
Kogyo K.K. (Denka) is based on the acetylene process. The remainder 60 percent plants are based on
the butadiene process.
Acetylene (carbide) chemistry is a strong driver in China due to the immense coal reserves in the
country. Acetylene chemistry for instance dominates VCM (Vinyl Chloride Monomer – pre-cursor for
PVC production) production in China, and is almost non-existent elsewhere in the world.

Main Types of Rigid CR
General Purpose Grades (Normal Linear Grades)
General-purpose grades are mostly produced with n-dodecyl mercaptan as the chain transfer agent
and occasionally with xanthogen disulfides. If xanthogen disulfides are used, the elastomers are more
readily processible and have improved mechanical properties.
Precrosslinked Grades
Precrosslinked grades consist of a blend of soluble polychloroprene and CRoss-linked polychloroprene.
They show less swelling after extrusion (die swell) are suitable for the extrusion of profiled parts.
Sulphur Modified Grades
Sulphur-modified grades are copolymers of chloroprene and elemental sulphur. The viscosity is
adjusted – in contrast to general-purpose grades - mostly after polymerization by “peptization? of the
polysulfide bonds by e.g. thiuramdisulfides as peptization agents. Sulphur modification improves the
breakdown of the rubber during mastication (lowering of viscosity) and is used in particular for parts
exposed to dynamic stress, such as driving belts, timing belts or conveyor belts because of their
excellent mechanical properties. But the polymers are less stable during storage and less resistant to
aging.
Slow Crystallizing Grades
Slow crystallizing grades are polymerized with 2, 3-dichloro-1, 3-butadiene as a co-monomer. The co-
monomer reduces the degree of crystallization by introducing irregularities into the polymer chain.
High polymerization temperatures also make structural irregularities, if this co-monomer is not
available. Crystallization resistant grades are used to produce rubber articles, which have to retain
their rubbery properties at very low temperatures.

Applications and Uses of Rigid CR
CR is used mainly in the automotive, building, construction and cable and wire industry and has a large
usage as adhesives in the mentioned industries as well as other industries.
In automotive industry, CR goes into the manufacture of hoses to withstand high pressure, oil and fuel
hoses, as well as moulded parts like bellows, axle boots, membranes, spring elements, dampeners,
and windshield wipers.
In the general industrial use, CR is as a raw material for manufacture of hoses to withstand high
pressure, hoses for use in the petroleum industry, floating hoses, power transmission belts, conveyor
belts and other smaller uses like cover for rollers in printing industry, textile and paper industry, as
well as rubberized fabrics for containers, tarpaulins and boats.
One of the most well-known uses of CR is in the manufacture of foam rubber sheet for wet suits used
during diving operations in the sea.
In the building and construction industry, CR is mainly used in form of sealing strips for windows,
doors, facades as well as expansion joints for civil engineering applications. Apart from this, CR finds
extensive usage in flexible cables for underground and mining operations, transport and conveying
systems, domestic appliances, suspension units for elevators as well as machine tools. Figure C-3 gives
an overview of the global application split for CR in 2014.

The largest end use application for CR has been in rubber (elastomeric applications, cross-linked
rubber as well as non-cross-linked) goods, which accounted for about 60% of the market in 2014. This
has been divided into the demand by the automotive industry, which was about 25% of the total
demand, as well as demand by the cable sheaths and other electrical applications which was estimated
to be about 20% of the demand. Another 20% of the demand was accounted by the general rubber
goods like hoses, pipes, belts and other minor applications. Another major use for CR has been the
adhesives segment, which accounted for about 29% of the total demand for CR, with water based
adhesives gaining prominence over the solvent based ones. The remaining 6% is used for other
applications like artificial leather, gloves and others. This final segment is under quite some threat
from newer materials such as polyurethane elastomers.

Market Overview
Global Market Overview
In 2014, the total demand for CR was estimated to be about 345 kta, stagnant over the previous year
demand. The demand growth trend has witnessed similar movements to the trends in GDP growth
rates, declining by 2.0% and 1.8% in 2008 and 2009 respectively owing to the economic downturn.
The demand grew strongly in 2010, by 10%, overcoming the decline of the preceding years. In 2011,
demand growth was at 4.6%. However in 2012, the demand contracted by 7.3% as the Eurozone CRisis
loomed and the Chinese economy witnessed sluggish growth. The demand in 2013 increased modestly
by 1.5%. Overall the demand for CR has increased from 280 kta in 2000 to the current levels showing
a CAGR of about 1.5%. This relatively lower growth rates is a result of decline in usage of chloroprene
in certain applications where substitution has taken place mainly by rubbers like EPDM. In matured
markets like North America and Western Europe, the market has remained more or less stagnant in
the past 14 years. The demand for CR has grown at about 0.24 times the GDP in the past 14 years,
owing to the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 affecting the overall market demand. Prior to the
economic downturn, the demand grew by about 2.4% between 2000 and 2007; which in absolute
numbers indicate the growth of the demand from 280 kta in 2000 to 330 kta in 2007.




                                                  22
In the period 2011-2014, the review update period, the demand for CR has been thus almost stagnant.
While the economic factors have some impact, CR has been under pressure from other elastomers
such as TPEs (Thermoplastic Elastomers), EPDM and polyurethane elastomers that have eaten into
the possible growth for CR, thus keeping CR growth well below GDP.
Between 2014 and 2019, the demand for CR is likely to grow by a CAGR of 1.0% as the product
continues to face challenges owing to substitution by other rubber products. In the long term forecast,
between 2014 and 2040, the CAGR is likely to be about 1.2%, growing at about 0.38 times the
estimated GDP growth rates.

Demand by Region

Asia, which was already the biggest market for CR in 2000, consolidated further its position by 2014,
but not as much as seen in other rubber and elastomers, and thermoplastics. This has been due to
more modest demand for CR in Asia compared to other rubber and elastomeric products, and the
maintenance of relatively stable growth rates in the other regions. CR has had a longer time to
establish in the developed economies and remains susceptible to substitution, whereas in the
emerging economic power houses, it competes head to head with TPEs etc in new and emerging
applications and thus there is limited room for substitution. CR is also a highly priced product and can
be almost seen as a niche elastomer, and the price sensitive regions in Asia thus are more resistant to
CR unless applications absolutely demand the unique mix of CR’s properties. The demand in Asia
comes in mainly from China as well as India. While China has its own production base, India is totally
dependent on imports. The demand in Asia grew from 122 kta in 2000 to about 163 kta in 2014,
witnessing a CAGR of 2.2% the span of 14 years. This growth in demand is driven by adhesives as well
as the automotive applications. However, it must be noted that in the past few years, demand for CR
has been affected mainly due to substitution as well as the market being affected by the economic
downturn. North American demand has witnessed little growth in the past 14 years, with demand
growing from 63 kta in 2000 to 66 kta in 2014. The demand has been stable, and owing to this, its
share in the global demand decreased from 23% in 2000 to 19% in 2014 as Asian demand grew.
The Western European demand increased from 63 kta in 2000 to about 80 kta in 2014, witnessing a
CAGR of 1.6% in the past 14 years. Its share in the global demand has remained at 22-23% over the
years. The demand growth has been mainly supported by high growth levels in Germany. The usage
in adhesives, as well as industrial rubber products drove the demand for CR to increase in the past 14
years.
Eastern European demand has been low historically, following the dissolution of USSR. The demand
in 2000 was estimated to be about 9 kta while increasing to 10 kta in 2014, with a CAGR of 0.4%.
Demand peaked at 14 kta in the 2007 before the onset of the economic downturn. The region’s share
in the global demand has been stable at 3%.
The South American increased from 16 kta in 2000 to about 18 kta in 2014. The South American
demand has remained between 12 kta to 18 kta in the past 14 years. The region witnessed a decline
in this share in the global demand from 6% in 2000 to about 5% in 2014.
The Middle East/Africa has been the only region (not counting Japan) which has witnessed a
contraction in CAGR by 0.3% between 2000 and 2014. The demand peaked at 11 kta in 2007 and 2010.
It must be noted that all demand requirements for CR in the Middle East/African region has been met
via imports. The Middle Eastern region share in the global demand declined from 3% to 2%. Figure C-
6 gives the regional CR growth profiles between 2000 and 2040.

Demand Outlook
The demand elasticity (Demand/GDP Ratio) has been historically at about 0.24 between 2000 and
2014 (taking into account the downturn years of 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2012). The demand drop has
been significant in Asia, North America, South America and Middle East/African region. 2010 has been
the only year which has witnessed a strong demand/GPD ratio of 1.1. Overall the product has had a
low demand elasticity as a result of the economic downturn and substitution by other rubbers in
industries like automotive and manufacturing. These industries collapsed as the overall
macroeconomic situation was affected, in turn resulting in lower demand for CR. In the short term
forecast till 2019, the demand elasticity is anticipated at about 0.35, while in the long term forecast
till 2040, it is expected that the demand will grow at about 0.38 times the GDP growth rates.

Between 2000 and 2014, the global demand for CR was about 1.5% taking the economic downturn
years into account. During this time the average demand grew at about 0.24 times the GDP.
Historically CR has always grown below GDP levels, mainly because its end use industries are not
directly linked to the macroeconomic parameters except for automotive. In the forecast, the major

                                                                    26
demand for the product is likely to come in from Asia where the demand is likely to grow owing to the
higher demand from manufacturing segments. Regions like North America and Western Europe which
are already saturated are likely to contribute to a lower extent to the global demand.

In the long term forecast till 2040, CR demand is likely to grow at about 1.2%, with demand volumes
increasing from 345 kta in 2014 to about 465 kta in 2040, with average demand additions of 5 kta per
annum. North America and Western Europe are likely to grow at very low levels at about 0.3 to 0.5%
in the long term forecast till 2040, as demand matures and end use industries like automotive and
adhesive manufacture move to cheaper labour zones like Asia. Asia, as well as Middle East/Africa is
expected to grow at 1.7% in the long term forecast till 2040, with China leading the growth in the
region. In case of Middle East, Government incentives are likely to encourage companies to set shop
for downstream derivatives like automotive which will increase the demand for CR in the region.
As the substitution cycle reached and end, possibly by 2020-ish, one can expect a stable growth rate
in application areas where CR has unique mix of performance and price balance.

Global Supply
In 2014, the global capacity for CR was estimated to be 400 kta. Between 2000 and 2014, capacity
contracted by about 17 kta with the shut-down of major facilities in North America and Western
Europe, while some new capacity additions occurred in Asia; either due to expansion of existing
Japanese plants or new plants in China.
In 2014, Asia accounted for about 60% of the total installed capacity while Western Europe comprised
21% of the total installed capacities. North America constituted about 19%.

Historically since the start of the decade, Asia has been the dominant region for capacities. In 2000,
Asia, mostly led by Japan was about 35% of the total installed capacity, with North America and
Western Europe at 33% and 29% respectively. However, by 2014, these percentages have changed
and now Asia (mainly Japan and China) constitutes about 60% of the market. The share of North
America has gone down to 19% due to shutting down of capacities, while Western Europe has gone
down to 21% owing to similar reasons.


                                                        28
In Asia, capacities are present mainly in Japan and China. Historically, Japan has been the dominant
country for chloroprene production, with three companies catering to large exports. In 2006, Denki
Kagaku raised its capacity from 48 kta to 66 kta, further strengthening Japan’s position in the CR
market, while in 2008; Tosoh Corporation inCReased its capacity by 2 kta from 32 kta to 34 kta. The
subsequent years, saw more capacity additions in Japan, with Denki Kagaku inCReasing capacity to 70
kta in 2008 and a further to total of 100 kta in 2010 (new line). Since Japan is a net exporter of the
product, all capacity additions are mainly aimed at catering to the export markets. Chinese capacities
inCReased from 48kta in 2000 to about 85 kta in 2014, with the new Chinese/Armenian joint venture
plant, Shanxi Synthetic Rubber Group starting up its 30 kta plant in mid-2010 at half capacity, but
gradually inCReasing towards its nameplate in the subsequent years.
In North America, there has been only one producer DuPont Dow Elastomers – a joint venture of
DuPont and Dow, who shut down its capacity in Kentucky and resulted in consolidation of capacity at
its plant in Louisiana. Now the region has a total capacity of approximately 75 kta. This joint venture
of DuPont-Dow recently sold the plant to Denka Joint Venture (Denka 70%, Mitsui 30%) with the deal
scheduled for completion in 2H2015 as stated in industry news.
In Western Europe, the original Bayer plant was bought over by Lanxess in 2005, and now the plant in
Germany has approximately 83 kta of capacity which includes both solid rubber and latex. The only
other plant of CR in Western Europe was in France, a 43 kta plant owned by Enichem. However due
to poor economic conditions and other issues, the older Enichem plant was closed down in 2005, and
now Laxness is the sole producer of the product in Western Europe. Lanxess have recently completed
their proposed expansion works on the solids finishing line, inCReasing the overall solids rubber output
rate to 63 kta. These works however did not affect the overall facility production rate. Trade statistics
in Eurostat suggest that Lanxess may have a higher capacity in Germany of nearly 105 kta, but this
could not be confirmed from any other additional sources.
In Eastern Europe, Nairit has been the sole producer of the product, with the plant located in Armenia.
In the earlier years, the plant was converted into a butadiene based plant from an acetylene based
plant, however due to lack of raw material; about 12 kta of the capacity from acetylene route has been
retained up to 2010, when all production ceased due to accrued debts. The butadiene based plant
stopped production in 1994 due to lack of raw materials and has not been in use since then. Attempts
are underway to revamp and restart the plant.
In India, Pidilite Industries Ltd has previously undertaken efforts to relocate the old Enichem plant
from France to a site at Dahej, Gujarat, India. However, it appears that efforts to set up production in
India have not been successful to date and the project is currently on-hold, with Pidilite looking for a
strategic partner willing to bring their technical know-how.
Thus, if the Nairit capacity addition in Eastern Europe should come online, , the dynamics of the
capacity percentages will change globally, with the Asian share declining to 58%, while the Eastern
European share will inCRease to 7% of the global capacity. North America will further decline to 17%
while Western Europe will come down to 18% of the global installed capacities.
In the long term forecast, Middle East Africa as well as South America is also likely to start some
production CR to cater to local demand.

between 2014 and 2021.

While there is no direct relation between the capacity additions and the demand, it must be noted
that the CR market is currently over supplied.

Chloroprene Rubber Trade Balance
In 2014, the net trade position was approximately 35,000 tons of CR – with Eastern Europe, South
America, Middle East and Africa as a group having this net import position, and Asia, North America
and Western Europe having the corresponding net export position. This quantity is equivalent to
nearly 10% of the total production in 2014. Since the production is clustered only in certain countries,
there significant trade of the production throughout the globe between the major regional
geographies. Japan continues to dominate the global market as net exporter, while the Rest of Asia
(excluding China and Japan) is on balance the largest importer10.
In 2014, nearly 35,000 tons of CR got traded in between regions, which is equivalent to nearly 10% of
the total production in 2014. Since the production is clustered only in certain countries, there is ample
trade of the production throughout the globe. Japan continues to dominate the global market as net
exporter, while Rest of Asia is a dominant net importer.
The trade for non-latex CR was almost three times of latex CR. In 2013, almost 170 kta of non-latex CR
got imported as compared to 56 kta of latex CR, as per UN statistics. On a regional basis, Asia was the
largest importer of non-latex CR with nearly 83 kta imported in 2013. Asia was also one of the largest
exporters of non-latex CR, exporting about 105 kta in 2013, with Japan accounting over 96 kta out of
the 105 kta. In case of latex CR, China has been the largest importer of the product in 2013, while
Germany has been the largest exporter of the product.
The Asian region is more or less a balanced market and will convert to a minor exporter in the forecast
years; Japan expected to satisfy the demand of China and Rest of Asia. The North American market
has been a net exporter of the product till 2007, but turned into a small importer after the closure of
capacities. Similarly the Western European region has been a net exporter as demand lowered within
the region. Middle East/Africa and South America have no capacities currently and hence are net
importer of the product. In case of Eastern Europe, due to sporadic production, the region has been a
net importer of the product historically.
In the future, Asia and North America are expected to be more or less balanced markets, while
Western Europe is expected to convert to a minor net importer, albeit in small volumes, as no new
capacity is expected in the region. South America as well as Middle East/ Africa are likely to remain
net importers of the product, those the volumes are expected to decline once few new capacities
come up in the region. Eastern Europe will convert to net exporter if the Nairit plant comes on-stream.
However, if the Nairit plant does not come online, the region is likely to remain a net importer of the
product, though volumes will be low.
As per the latest reports, China has decided to continue to impose anti-dumping duty on imports of
CR from European Union, North America and Japan. China had previously imposed antidumping duties

10
  Please note that due to inconsistencies in the trade information databases, the statistics do not always balance
out the net exports versus the net imports as a zero sum game at a global level

                                                                  30
of 2-151% on chloroprene rubber imported from Japan, the US and the European Union for 5 years
from May 2005. A fresh probe in May 2010 was undertaken and in May 2011 the duties have been
imposed for another five years.
In August 2010, US announced that it is removing a 36 year anti-dumping duty on imports of CR from
Japan. In August 2013, Showa Denka expanded its operations in the US, setting up a storage and
distribution facility for CR latex and solids in the country.
Any future CR rubber capacity additions will most likely be directly related to both the availability of
low cost butadiene, as well as cheap electric power. As butadiene demand in recent years has led to
large price differential between butadiene and butanes, efforts are under way to develop alternative
and on-purpose processes for butadiene, with the dehydrogenation of butane-1 (BDH process) being
at the forefront. The capacity will be added in countries with “wet? gas (including shale gas) and LPG.
Thus the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and North America can be expected to add capacity while South
America and Asia will continue to dominate the imports picture in the long term.

Table C-9 gives a listing of various industry structure metrics for the CR industry

The total global production capacity of CR was 400 kta in 2014.
The concentration ratio is the proportion of the total industry production capacity owned by the five
largest firms. It is therefore a straightforward measurement of the degree of consolidation. A
concentration ratio of 83% is indicative of a high concentration market with reasonably high degree
of competition.
The Herfindahl Index (HI) is a measure of the degree of consolidation and the amount of competition
in an industry. It is equal to the sum of the squares of the market shares of each firm. The HI can
range from 0 to 1 moving from a large number amount of small firms to a single monopolistic
producer. HI values between 0.100 and 0.180 are generally considered to indicate a ‘moderately
concentrated’ market and above 0.180 to be a ‘concentrated’ market. The benefit of the HI over the
concentration ratio is that it gives more weight to larger firms.

The Herfindahl Index (HI) index for the CR industry is 0.219 indicating that the degree of concentration
in the market is high. This is not an indication of a commodity product and there are changes of control
over the price. There have been cases of cartel formation by some companies including Bayer (now
the plant is a part of Lanxess), Showa Denko, DuPont/Dow, ENI and Tosoh. Between 1993 and 2002,
these companies shared the market and fixed prices for chloroprene rubber globally as per
Department of Justice, Canadian Competition Bureau and European Commission reports.

As shown in Table C-6, two producers have above 20% market share in the industry. Denki Kagaku in
Japan has the largest market share in the industry, followed by Lanxess in Western Europe. Other
producers control 10% or less.
Note on Dormagen (LANXESS) and LaPlace (Denka/Mitsui) plants
As part of Lanxess spin-off from Bayer, Lanxess inherited CR business in 2005, and the CR production
facility then had a capacity of 83 kta. Soon after that it was announced that the capacity had been
upgraded to 80kta. However in 2008, news reports indicated that the plant only had a capacity of 57
kta and that Lanxess was planning to upgrade the capacity to 65 kta. At the same time Lanxess
announced that it was seeking and environmental permit for up to 105 kta. All the import/export data
bases indicate that the production capacity in Germany has to be in the region of at least 100 kta to
be able to run at full capacity and a little above that to be able to match the trade numbers. These
trade numbers are consistent across all databases and normally extremely reliable. However, we have
not been able to confirm the capacity of Lanxess and hence it has been considered at 83 kta in our
model.
DuPont and Dow Chemical formed the Dow-DuPont Elastomers JV in the early 1990s capitalizing on
the metallocene olefins elastomers boom. This JV was broken up in 2005, and the CR plants reverted
back to DuPont. At that time DuPont had a total capacity of 100 kta with two plants – Louisville, KY
and La Place, LA with capacities of 55 and 45 kta respectively. Crucially, the monomer production
facility is located at La Place, LA. In 2005, DuPont tried to obtain approvals to move the LaPlace plant
to Louisville but encountered major environmentalists pressure and was not allowed to do so. It thus

                                                            33
shut down the Louisville plant in 2006.There has been limited mention made that some of the
polymerisation and final finishing lines were moved from Louisville to La Place. All indications are that
the resulting capacity at the La Place plant was expanded to 75kta, and this is the capacity that
matches the trade information. Recent industry reports indicate that DuPont has signed an agreement
to sell its Neoprene business to Denka JV (Denka 70%, Mitsui 30%) and the deal is scheduled to be
completed in H2 2015.
Figure C-12 and Figure C-13 below give the comparison between the capacities of the key producers
in 2000 and 2014.

The global share for CR has seen changes in the past 14 years. New producers have entered the
market, and some producers have shut shop due to poor market conditions. Bayer now bought over
by Lanxess continues to dominate the global capacity in both the years, maintaining its share at 21%
and now is the second largest producer of CR globally. In case of DuPont/Dow, its market share has
dropped from 34% in 2000 to 19% in 2014, as it closed one of its plants in the USA and the other plant
went to DuPont as the JV dissolved. Following the sale of LaPlace plant, DuPont will exit the business
completely. Conversely, Denki Kagaku has increased its share from 12% in 2000 to about 25% in 2014,
making it the largest producer of CR, mainly due to capacity expansion in Japan. Once, the sale of
LaPlace is finalised, Denki Kagaku will further increase its market leader position.

Supply/Demand Balance
Global Scenario
The global demand for CR was estimated to be about 344 kta in 2014, growing at a CAGR of 1.5% from
a total demand of 280 kta in 2000. In the past 14 years, the demand witnessed an average growth of
5 kta per annum; however saw the demand contract in the recession years of 2008, 2009 and
2012.Between 2014 and 2019, the demand is likely to grow at a CAGR of 1.0% as demand stagnates
in developed economies and grows at slightly levels in Asia. In the long term forecast, the demand is
likely to grow at about 0.38 times the GDP levels, at a CAGR of 1.2% between 2014 and 2040.
The utilisation rates for CR have been fluctuating between 78% and 97% in the past 14 years; averaging
to about 81%. The utilisation rates averaged 72% between 2000 and 2005, but the rates have since
moved up reaching up to nearly 82% in 2006, as demand grew and capacities shut down. The
utilisation rates peaked at 97% in 2008. However, due to the economic downturn, the rates declined
again, to 85% in 2009. After that they have shown some recovery and global utilisation rates were 92%
in 2010 and 91% in 2011. In 2012, as demand contracted by 7.3%, the utilisation rates lowered to 82%
and have remained so in 2014. In the long term future till 2040, the utilisation rates are likely to be in
the higher-80s.

North America
North American demand for CR was estimated to be about 66 kta, showing a small growth of 0.5%
over the previous year. The market has grown by a CAGR of 0.3% in the past 14 years, from 63 kta in
2000, to the current level. Demand for the product is likely to come in from segments like automotive
parts and construction. Though the market has been affected in the near past, this demand is likely to
come up in the short term and midterm forecast marginally. Between 2014 and 2019, the demand is
likely to grow at about 0.4% to as the product faces competition from substitute materials. In the long
term forecast till 2040, the demand is expected to increase by a CAGR of 0.3%, as the market matures
even further.
There has been only one producer of CR in the region, a joint venture of Dow and DuPont. Earlier there
were two locations within the US producing CR, however the joint venture of Dow/DuPont, shut down
its capacity in Kentucky and moved some of its capacity to its plant at Louisiana. The plant has now
been bought over by Denka/Mitsui JV with final agreements expected to be signed in H2 2015. There
are no capacity additions announced in the near future till 2019, and there may be some speculative
capacity additions expected towards the end of the forecast period till 2040.
The utilisation rates for CR in North America have been fluctuating to 97% to as low as 69% depending
on the local demand and export requirements. In the past few years, the utilisation rates have
averaged towards mid to higher 80s. In 2009, the utilisation rate was about 88%, while in 2010; it
lowered to 86%. Similarly in 2011, the rates went down even further to about 80% despite no capacity
additions mainly due to decline of local demand as well as export demand as well as issues related to
non-availability of raw material. In 2014, the operating rates returned to 95% and in the long term
forecast are expected to remain in the mid-90s till 2040.
The region has been a net exporter of CR historically but in 2011, converted into net importer. In 2014,
the region went back to being a net exporter of the product. Germany is the key import country for
trade with the US. In the long term forecast, the region is likely to be more or less balanced in its
requirements of CR, with very few marginal exports expected in the long term forecast.
Figure C-15 indicates that North America has been a net exporter of CR since 2000 to 2010 and turned
into an importer in 2011, and continued this status for the subsequent two years.

The exports from North America have declined through the years, mainly because of capacity shut
down. In 2000, the exports were about 39 kta, which declined to about 10 kta in 2005, before
increasing in 2006, and then again declining in 2007. In 2011, the region converted to a net importer,
as utilisation rates went down. The region will be more or less balanced in its requirements of CR,
converting to net exporter again when the speculative capacities come on-stream towards the end of
the forecast period.

South America
The total demand for CR in South America in 2014 was estimated to be 18 kta. The demand improved
by 2.5% over the previous year demand, which was about 17 kta. Historically the demand for CR in
South America has fluctuated between 12 kta to 17 kta, with demand peaking in 2014. The region has
been affected by the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 with demand contracting in the two years.
The region posted a CAGR of 0.5% between 2000 and 2014; however, it should be noted that the
demand is a fluctuating one dependent on imports. In the short term forecast between 2014 and 2019,
the demand for CR is estimated to rise at about 2.1% mainly due to demand from the automotive and
construction segments. Even in the long term forecasts till 2040, demand is likely to be positive and
increase at a CAGR of 1.7% between 2014 and 2040.

                                                               37
There are no capacities for CR in the region currently and no announcements are anticipated in the
near future till 2019. Even in the long term forecast, capacities are likely to come up only post 2028,
as the region continues to rely on imports owing to its small demand base. Future utilisation rates are
likely to be in the lower to mid-80s.
The following chart Figure C-17 gives an overview of the net exports of South America from 2000 to
2014 which shows that the region has always been a major importer of the product.

In line with the demand fluctuations the region’s import demands have fluctuated, peaking at 17 kta
in 2007 before dropping in 2008. This trend is likely to continue and the region is expected to CR in
the long term forecast mainly because of lack of any new capacities in the region.

Western Europe
In 2014, the Western European demand was estimated to be about 80 kta, higher than the previous
year by about 1.0%. The demand has grown from 63 kta in 2000 to the current levels witnessing a
CAGR of 1.6% in a span of 14 years. The economic downturn did not have a very profound effect on
the growth rates of Western Europe and the demand has been consistently increasing. However, the
demand contracted in 2012 and 2013 by 1.6% and 1.3% respectively. In the short term forecast, the
demand is likely to grow at a slightly lower level, mainly as end user industries move out of the region
to low cost locations. Between 2014 and 2019, the demand for CR in the region is anticipated to
increase at a CAGR of 0.8% while in the long term forecast from 2014 to 2040; the regional demand is
estimated to grow at a CAGR of 0.5%, as the market matures.
Between 2000 and 2005, there have been only two producers of CR in the region. Bayer sold off its CR
business to Lanxess in 2005, and ENI closed its 45 kta capacity in France. However, Lanxess has also
added capacities over the past few years, and now the overall capacity of CR in the region is estimated
to be about 83 kta including both solid and latex CR. Trade statistics indicate that Lanxess may have a
higher capacity up to nearly 100 kta, but this could not be confirmed, In the near forecast, no capacity
additions have been announced. .The region will be a small importer of the product and no speculative
capacity is likely to come up by 2040 as per our estimates.


                                                    39
The region has had one of the highest utilisation rates globally, with rates averaging about 99% in the
past 14 years between 2000 and 2014. Our model depicts utilisation rates above 100% in certain years
based on demand and trade statistics giving an indication that Lanxess capacity may be under
reported. The rates are likely to be around the mid-90s in the long term forecast till 2040.
Western Europe, specifically Germany, has strengthened its position as a net exporter of CR globally.
However, as the domestic demand increased by 1.6% in the past 14 years, net exports have fluctuated
between 17 kta to 30 kta. These exports are likely to decline as demand increases modestly in the
region and more importantly, no new capacities additions are expected. In the long term forecast, the
region is likely to be a marginal importer, importing 9 to 10 kta volumes.

Central and Eastern Europe (C&E Europe)
In 2014, the C&E European market demand was estimated to be 10 kta, growing at a CAGR of 0.4%
between 2000 and 2014. Before the economic downturn the region grew at over 7.2% between 2000
and 2007, however, the demand declined in 2008, by -12.8% and again in 2009, by over -40% to 7 kta.
In 2010, the market recovered but again declined in 2011 and 2012. The market improved in 2013 and
2014 to reach the current levels of demand. Post 2011, all demand in the market has been met via
imports as the sole producer in the region, Nairit, has not been able to produce any CR. In the short
term forecast between 2014 and 2019, we estimate that, the region’s demand is likely to grow at a
CAGR of 3.7% supported by the strong demand from the automotive and adhesives market, while in
the long term forecast till 2040, the regional demand is estimated to grow by a CAGR of 2.9% till 2040.
Nairit was the only plant in the entire C&E European region for CR. The plant had a capacity of 12 kta
from the acetylene route up to 2010 and this has been the case since 1991. The plant has produced
CR sporadically depending on the availability of the raw material, mechanical reliability of the plant
and the demand in the region. At present, the plant is shut down and additional investment is required
before production may be resumed. Thus, all of the region’s demand is catered via imports. Nairit is
looking to expand the plant, where both acetylene and butadiene routes are being considered. In the
case of the former option, the plant capacity would be increased in stages, first to 12 kta and then 24
kta. The butadiene option focusses on a 25 kta capacity addition. Either way, this project is some way

off from being realised and at best can be described as speculative capacity. . Apart from this no other
capacity is expected to come up in the region in the mid-term forecast.
C&E Europe has historically been a net importer of CR since the dissolution of USSR, and is only likely
to convert to a net exporter, albeit in small volumes, if the expansion of the Nairit plant were to take
place.
The following chart Figure C-21 gives an overview of the net imports of C&E Europe from 2000 to 2014
which shows that the region has always been a major importer of the product.

The region has maintained its position as a net importer, with imports increasing from 7 kta in 2000
to over 10 kta in 2014. In the forecasted years, the region is likely to convert into net exporter once
the 30 kta plant comes on-stream in 2019. However, if the plant will not come on-stream by the
expected date of 2019, then the region is likely to remain a net importer of the product in small
volumes of 6-7 kta.

Asia
Asia has been the key region for both production and demand for CR. The Asian demand was
estimated to be 163 kta in 2014, with China driving the demand growth. The Asian demand has grown
by a CAGR of 2.2% in the past 14 years, from levels of 122 kta in 2000. The region witnessed a decline
in demand during the economic downturn years, with demand falling by -1.9% in 2008. In 2009, the
demand recovered by a small value of 1.7%, and more strongly at 12.5% and 10.1% respectively in
2010 and 2011. The year 2012 witnessed a contraction in demand by 12% mainly due to the sluggish
economy of India and China. The demand increased again in 2013, while declined marginally by 1.3%
in 2014. In the short term forecast between 2014 and 2019, the demand is likely to grow by a CAGR
of 1.8% with higher demand expected from automotive and industrial segments. This growth rate is
likely to be maintained even in the long term forecast till 2040, as demand grows steadily initially from
China and then from South East Asia. Japan will continue to grow at lower growth rates, owing to its
mature market conditions.
Japan has been the key region for exports in Asia since the start of the decade. Asian capacities
increased from 146 kta in 2000 to 242 kta in 2014, adding about 96 kta of capacities within 14 years.
Japanese producers further expanded their existing plants, while producers in China set up new
capacities to decrease its reliance on Japanese CR, with the latest being the Shanxi Synthetic Rubber
company / Nairit JV plant, adding additional notional 30 kta of capacity in 2010. We understand that


                                                     43
the plant output was limited to 15 kta due to calcium carbide shortages up to 2014, when another
older 12 kta CR facility was shut, resulting in 12 kta of capacity being removed. Although there were
some announcements as to further additional CR projects, these seem unlikely to ever be progressed
further, given the low Chinese utilisation rates (55%). Overall, the Chinese plants have struggled to
operate consistently due to mechanical reliability, quality control (unable to produce on-spec product)
and EPDM substitution issues, as well as excess Japanese volumes (despite the anti-dumping
measures).
In addition to the above, Pidilite Industries Ltd, was planning to set up a CR plant in India (based on
the equipment relocated from the old EniChem French facility), but has run into serious execution
issues. There has been no recent progress on the project and Pidilite Industries are currently looking
for some external assistance to enable further progress. Sources believe that the plant is not likely to
come up in the near future.
Asian utilisation rates averaged 81% in the past 14 years, declining from 84% in 2000 to 77% in 2003,
as new capacities got added, and rising again to 92% in 2007 as demand peaked. However, due to the
effect of the economic downturn as well as new capacity additions, the rates have been between 76%
to 85%%. The utilisation rates are likely to be in the mid-80s in the long term forecast till 2040.
Asia has been fluctuating between being a net importer and net exporter of CR. This is mainly because
Japan has been a strong exporter globally while China and Rest of Asia relies on imports for its
domestic demand. Post 2006, with new capacities coming on-stream in China, the Asian region has
been a net exporter of the product. The market is likely to remain a net exporter of the product in the
forecast period till 2040.

Middle East and Africa
The demand for CR in Middle East/Africa was estimated to be about 7 kta in 2014. The region has
historically been a low demand region with all demand catered via imports due to lack of a capacity in
the region. The demand has fluctuated between 7 kta to 11 kta in the historical period. The CAGR of
the region in the time period between 2000 and 2014 was about --0.3%, becoming the only region to
witness a negative growth rate in demand during this time period. However, as local Middle East
Governments encourage downstream derivative products to be set up, the region is expected to
witness growth rates of about 2.0% in the short term forecast till 2019, and after that it is expected to
grow at a CAGR of 1.7% between 2014 and 2040.
Currently there are no CR capacities in the region and none have been announced for the short term
forecast. However due to incentives offered by the Government to encourage downstream
petrochemical products, the chances of a new plant being set up in the region is very high and the
region is likely to have new capacities post 2025. Future utilisation rates are expected to be in the
lower 80s.
The region has been completely reliant on imports to meet its demand and until new capacities come
up this situation is likely to continue. Turkey is one of the largest importers of the product in the region
importing non-latex CR mainly from Germany and Japan. Turkey imported nearly 4.1 kta of CR in 2013.


The following chart Figure C-25 gives an overview of the net imports of Middle East/Africa from 2000
to 2014 which shows that the region has always been a major importer of the product.

The region has maintained its position as a net importer, with imports increasing from 7 kta in 2000
to over 11kta in 2011 before declining to 7 kta in 2014. In the forecasted years, the region is likely to
be more or less balanced in its CR requirements, importing very small volumes.

It is anticipated that as the Middle East moves into manufacturing more sophisticated industries such
as oil well components, perhaps even automobiles that the CR demand will rise in the medium and
longer term. As the governments encourage more specialised elastomers production with the GCC
countries, one can expect a medium sized investment being made in CR rubber in the region.
Apart from the Republic of South Africa, and the Mediterranean coastal countries, demand in Africa
remains small.

Chloroprene Rubber Target Markets
To identify the target markets for the project, we need to evaluate the major CR markets in the regions
located near the project as well as large markets which are significant importers of the product. The
key regions mainly evaluated include countries of Asia mainly China and India, Western Europe and
Eastern Europe
All of these prima-facie short listed markets were reviewed for their long term attractiveness with
respect to;
       Total imports in 2013
       Long term trade status as net importer or net exporter
       Key market factors affecting the prospects, such as – market size, domestic competition, long
        term demand growth and logistics considerations.


Table C-17 reviews the attractiveness for each target market for CR. Whilst China’s import position
and geographic location means that it remains the focus for CR exports, India has very little non-
commodity petrochemicals, plastics and elastomers capacity and has a thriving and growing
automobile and construction services industry, thus it would be next in line despite the logistics
challenges. Thailand is becoming a low cost manufacturing centre for heavy construction industries
and is thus also exhibiting growth in demand for CR.
Other relevant markets are Eastern Europe, Turkey, Brazil and USA. While Eastern Europe and Turkey
won’t be able to absorb significant portion of the product, they location relative to Armenia makes
them attractive from a logistics point of view. Brazil is a major importer of polychloroprene within
South American markets, where other competitors also have significant logistical overheads,
somewhat balancing out the logistical costs from Armenia, whereas USA has been historically a price
premium market, so any product sold there should give a nice boost to the margin.

Assessment of the Technical Feasibility of Production




                       51
Introduction
In accordance with our technical assignment, Jacobs Consultancy visited the Nairit plant during the
last week of February 2015. The purpose of the site visit was to assess the present condition of the
assets of CJSC “Nairit Plant? and collect all the necessary information with regards to the examined
assets.
The present report contains our assessment of the technical viability of the potential restart of
chloroprene rubber production on Nairit site. Thus, it contains the following topics:
      Location & History
      Existing Facilities Overview
      Condition of the existing facilities for production of chloroprene via Acetylene Route
       (Existing Process Units – Acetylene Route)
      Condition of the existing facilities for production of chloroprene via Butadiene Route
       (Existing Process Units – Butadiene Route)
      Utilities and Offsites Overview
      Additional Options Considered
      Required Capital Cost Investments
      Required Staffing Levels
The above was considered with a view to restarting production under one of the three currently
considered production scenarios:
      12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
      24 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
      25 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via butadiene route




                                                52
Overall Summary
Generally, the condition of the assets is such that the plant cannot be easily brought back into
operation without significant capital cost investment, regardless of which scenario is chosen:
      12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
      24 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
      25 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via butadiene route
The main obstacles to operation and overall capital costs investments required for each scenario are
summarised below.

Polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route – 12 kta
      The main technical obstacles are as follows:
      In order to ensure safe and efficient operation, effectively a completely new monomer
       production unit is required:
       o   New brine pipeline connecting Abovyan salt wells and the main site
       o   Largely rebuilt Chlor-Alkali unit (Areas 1-1, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-20)
       o   New Air Separation Unit (Area 1-6)
       o   Capital repairs on the oxygen line between Air Separation and main production sites.
       o   New Oxygen Boost Compressors (Area 1-7 a, b)
       o   New Methane Partial Oxidation Unit (Area 1-7 a, b)
       o   New Cracked Gas Compressors (Area 1-7 a, b)
       o   New Acetylene Extraction Unit (NMP Solvent) (Area 1-7 c)
       o   New Acetylene Gas Holder
       o   New Acetylene Dimerization Reaction section (Area 1-12 a)
       o   New Acetylene Compressors (Area 1-12 a)
       o   New Toluene Absorbers (Area 1-12 a)
       o   New MVA hydrochlorination section (Area 1-12 b)
       o   Relocated chloroprene distillation section (Area 1-12 b)
       o   New auxiliary storage tanks
       o   Utility distribution network to be retested and repaired where necessary.
       o   New control system, instrumentation, cabling and operator control rooms.
      The past performance of the Methane Partial Oxidation Unit was substantially below that of
       original design and what a modern unit should be achieving. However, access to BASF
       technology and specialists is an open question at present.
      For both of the considered scenarios of polychloroprene rubber production via acetylene, we
       have also considered an additional new Syngas Utilisation Unit, so as to make chloroprene
       production from acetylene more cost effective. However, any such option represents a
       significant added capital cost that is unlikely to be justified given the relatively small quantities
       of syngas available.


                                                   53
       There is a potential option to further expand acetylene production and diversify into other
        chemical businesses such 1,4-Butanediol. However, this requires further assessment, with the
        main risks being:
        o   Relatively high cost of natural gas
        o   Access to technology
        o   Logistics costs
       Operation with both highly corrosive and explosive fluids requires additional careful thought
        as to the existing unit spacing, personnel exposure and training.
       The indicative investment costs for this option are approximately US$ 192 million.
It is estimated that some 436 staff will be required to enable Nairit operations under this scenario.

Polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route – 24 kta
       The main technical obstacles are mainly the same as for the 12 kta scenario. The exceptions
        are as follows:
       In order to ensure safe and efficient operation, effectively a completely new monomer
        production unit line is required, which is of larger capacity, and thus requires further
        additional investment.
       In all cases, in order to make chloroprene production from acetylene cost effective, a new
        syngas utilisation unit is required. However, this is a significant added capital cost that is barely
        justified given the relatively small quantities of syngas available.
       The indicative investment costs for this option are approximately US$ 316 million.
It is estimated that some 488 staff will be required to enable Nairit operations under this scenario.

Polychloroprene rubber, via butadiene route – 25 kta
       The production from butadiene is both significantly safer and requires less capital investment.
        The main challenges are:
       Refit of the existing production unit for monomer from butadiene. The unit equipment is
        largely there, and owing to the exotic materials of construction is thought to be generally fit
        for production.
       The rail terminal for import of butadiene will need to be upgraded.
       Utility distribution network to be retested and repaired where necessary.
       New control system, instrumentation, cabling and operator control rooms will be required, as
        well as a new mechanical spares storage house, to be relocated a safe distance from the
        monomer unit.
       Any reconstruction work on the unit will need to rely on Nairit’s own knowledge of the
        process, as the past process licensor (BP Chem / Distillers) has not licensed a plant using this
        technology since the 1970s. Thus, the technical know-how outside of Nairit rests with current
        operators of such plants (Lanxess, DENKA, SDK and Tosoh) only.
       The indicative investment costs for this option are approximately US$ 236 million.
It is estimated that some 380 staff will be required to enable Nairit operations under this scenario.

Location & History
The CJSC “Nairit Plant? complex occupies a large plot area to the south of Yerevan city centre, within
the industrial park area. Originally, the site was located away from residential areas but, with the
passage of time, it has now been absorbed and is currently within the city limits. Thus, the health,
safety and environmental performance of the site has a direct impact on the health and welfare of
Yerevan’s residents.
Production on the site commenced in 1940, based on the calcium carbide route to acetylene (now
largely abandoned everywhere except China), which was then hydrochlorinated to chloroprene
monomer, from which the main synthetic Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) product was obtained. Over
the years the production was expanded first to 14 kta of PCR in 1942 and then up to 45 kta of PCR in
1961. Due to the expansion of the city towards the site and the environmental impact of acetylene
production from calcium carbide, the site switched to the natural gas route to acetylene and, in 1965,
the acetylene production from natural gas was launched. This, together with a revamp of the
chloroprene production unit, allowed further expansion of acetylene-based PCR production to 75 kta.
In parallel, a new Acetic Acid (AA) unit, based on the British Distillers process using light naphtha as a
feedstock, under a BP Chemicals licence, was started up in the 1970s, but only achieved design
capacity in early 1980s.
Likewise, due to the poor safety record of the chloroprene production from acetylene, a parallel 75
kta chloroprene-from-butadiene production process was set up under licence from BP Chemicals. The
plant was started up in 1983, and reached design capacity in 1987. In addition to this, a new PCR line
based on DuPont technology was installed in 1986, so as to allow production of up to 50 kta of PCR.
These changes allowed a shutdown of chloroprene production from acetylene, improving the inherent
process safety, as well as decommissioning of the old PCR lines which came to the end of their effective
working lives in 1988.
The demise of the USSR and the resultant logistics issues for the site resulted in the supply of both
light naphtha and butadiene from the newly formed Russian Federation being either cut or greatly
reduced, due to a break out in hostilities elsewhere in the Caucus mountains region and revised
feedstock pricing.
To overcome the shortage, and prevent site closure, chloroprene production from acetylene was
restarted, albeit at a reduced maximum PCR production rate of circa 10 kta, by making use of spare
equipment retained from previously much larger decommissioned acetylene based chloroprene
production unit. The site has struggled to be profitable since then, due to small plant throughputs and
thus an unprofitable operating rate. In the last decade, the technology used at Nairit site to produce
chloroprene from acetylene was licensed to China, and one of the three PCR drying, extrusion and
packaging lines was disassembled and relocated in China as part of that deal. This reduced the
maximum PCR rubber output to 25 kta, which is its present maximum capacity.
Since then, the unit has operated intermittently, due to global economy uncertainty and a major
explosion which resulted in 4 fatalities in May 2009. In March 2010, it was decided to idle all
production of PCR on site due to mounting debts with regard to natural gas and other utilities
providers.
As a result, all PCR production on site has been idled for the last 5 years.

Existing Facilities Overview
Nairit facilities are located on 4 separate sites, as follows:
       Main site, where the main ISBL process units are located. The site comprises of four main ISBL
        units, as well as the necessary utilities and offsite facilities to enable continuous production.
       ASU site, some 3 km away from the main site – location of the existing Air Separation Units
        (Area 1-6), which supply oxygen and nitrogen, as well as instrumentation air to the main site.
        The existing units are now defunct, and new Air Separation Units will be required if the site
        requires high purity oxygen for acetylene production. Conversely, where butadiene based
        production is required
       Kapuyt Lich water intake site, some 22 km away from the main site – location of the raw water
        intake. The interconnecting water pipeline is considered to be relatively satisfactory condition,
        as the site has continued to make use of water.
       Abovyan salt wells (Area 1-4a), providing the salt brine for the main site, originally connected
        to the main site via a 28 km pipeline. The old pipeline is now defunct, and a new 42 km pipeline
        will need to be installed, in order to bring brine supply to the main site.
The main process site is unique in the sense that it still contains chloroprene monomer production
units both from acetylene (derived from natural gas), as well as butadiene. Thus, Nairit have access to
two separate process routes for chloroprene rubber production.
A further discussion of the present condition of the process assets located on the above sites is
presented below. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition, the discussion is largely split into two parts:
       Production of chloroprene via acetylene, covering both scenarios for 12 and 24 kta of
        polychloroprene production respectively, via this intermediate.
       Production of chloroprene via butadiene, covering the third scenario – 25 kta of
        polychloroprene production from imported butadiene.

Existing Process Units – Acetylene Route
Summary of Main Process Units (ISBL)
The In Side Battery Limit (ISB) units are listed below:
       Chlor-Alkali (C-A) Unit:
       Area 1-1:         Solvay process area for CO2 production
       This area includes lime kilns for CO2 production that is required to produce sodium
        bicarbonate, Na2CO3. This in turn is required to precipitate out the impurities contained within
        raw brine prior to its electrolysis. Depending on the production scenario undertaken, it may
        be more cost effective to simply import sodium carbonate rather than operate these rather
        old kilns.
       Area 1-4 a, b:    Brine Production and Treatment
       This area includes the brine extraction well-sand planned brine solution treatment.
       Area 1-3 a, c:    Caustic Soda (NaOH) Production
       This area includes the brine treatment unit, as well as caustic soda production facilities
       Area 1-3 b:       Brine Electrolysis


                                                     56
   This area is the heart of the Chlor-Alkali unit; it comprises the diaphragm electrolysis cells
    which use purified brine to produce both hydrogen and chlorine, as required by the site,
    leaving behind residual cell liquor, which is re-circulated back to Area 1-3 a, c for caustic soda
    production
   Area 1-5:       Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) production
   This area contains HCl furnaces as well as falling film absorber packages
   Area 1-20:      Liquid Chlorine and Sodium Hypochlorite Production
   This area contains the chlorine liquefaction and sodium hypochlorite unit.
   Acetylene Production Unit (Natural Gas based):
   Area 1-6:      Air Separation Unit, for the production of oxygen, nitrogen, and
    instrumentation air
   Area 1-7a: Partial Oxidation Unit, for the production of cracking gas, containing a large
    acetylene fraction. This area also includes a black water treatment plant and a solids
    incineration unit.
   Area 1-7b: Acetylene Extraction Unit, which uses NMP solution as an extraction medium for
    acetylene separation from the rest of the cracking gas.
   Chloroprene (CR) Monomer Unit:
   Area 1-12a: Production of Mono-Vinyl-Acetylene (MVA) from acetylene. This unit includes
    acetylene compression and MVA synthesis and absorption into toluene.
   Area 1-12b: Production of Chloroprene from MVA. This unit includes MVA desorption from
    toluene solvent, MVA hydro-chlorination synthesis section and Chloroprene distillation
    (involving stabilization with NO)
   Stabilized chloroprene from Area 1-12b is then sent to Area 1-18 (described below) for
    neutralization before being sent to the PCR rubber unit.
   Area 1-19: Liquid and chlorinated hydrocarbon waste incineration unit. This area is used to
    incinerate any liquid and chlorinated hydrocarbon waste generated within chloroprene
    monomer unit based.
   Area 1-18: Although the equipment of this area relates mostly to the monomer production
    from butadiene, it also includes a nitric oxide preparation unit (from nitric acid), which is then
    fed to Area-12b (chloroprene distillation), to stabilize chloroprene monomer. Furthermore,
    the final neutralisation of the chloroprene monomer from acetylene is also carried out here.
   Poly-Chloroprene Rubber (PCR) Unit:
   Area 1-21: Recovery of recycled chloroprene. In this area, crude chloroprene monomer
    incoming from the chloroprene monomer unit (Area 1-18) is mixed with chloroprene recycle
    stream          from           chloroprene         polymerization         and   degassing
    (Area 1-22), is distilled and sent to polymerization reactors within Area 1-22.
   Area 1-22: Chloroprene polymerization and degassing. This area consists of a batch
    polymerization reaction section and subsequent degassing of the crude PCR latex product.

Condition of the Main Process Units – ISBL
Chlor-Alkali Unit
Process Overview
The key function of the chlor-alkali unit is produce HCl, necessary for the hydrochlorination of the
mono-vinyl acetylene (MVA), which is the final synthesis step of the chloroprene monomer production
from acetylene. The unit by-products are caustic soda, NaOH (part used for internal needs, part
exported), hydrogen (utilised for internal fuel needs) and sodium hypochlorite NaOCl (bleach, also
exported).
Each area is reviewed in more detail below.
Areas 1-4 a, b: Brine Production and Treatment
This area includes the brine extraction wells, and initial brine solution treatment.
The raw brine, produced from underground leaching wells (Area 1-4 a) located outside Yerevan city.
The existing brine pipeline is now defunct. The new proposed route, due to land ownership issues,
currently is supplied for treatment via a 42 km-long pipeline to a raw brine treatment Area (1-4 b).
The brine field was commissioned in 1971 with a design capacity of 45,000 m³ of brine per year,
operating with 5 wells.
As of present, the brine field consists of 5 wells, which are linked to CJSC “Nairit Plant? via a single
pipeline. The amount of wells in operation can be varied depending on brine consumption rate.
Given that construction works in the Area 1-4 b are currently in progress, brine treatment takes place
in Area 1-3 a instead.
Area 1-3 a: Brine Treatment
This area receives brine from the incoming feed pipe to the site, as well as the recycled brine from the
caustic production. The brine is purified using a Solvay type process, so that Chlorinated Lime is also
produced. As such, Lime furnace area 1-1 is considered part of this process area 1-3a.
Area 1-3b: Brine Electrolysis
After the treatment, purified brine solution, with NaCl concentration of 300-310 g/l is fed to
electrolysis cell rooms, located in Chlor-Alkali production Area 1-3b, where diaphragm electrolysis
process takes place. Direct current is applied to the electrolysis cells. The main reaction taking place
at the anode is the reduction of chloride ions into chlorine gas which can be summarized by the
following reaction:
                                            2Сl¯ - 2e¯ → Cl2
The main electrolytic process at the cathode is the dissociation of water molecules and the formation
of hydrogen, which can be summarised by following reactions:


                                       H2O + 2e¯→ 2OH¯ + 2H+
                                            2H+ +2e¯→ H2
In the remaining solution, Na+ and Cl¯ ions form sodium hydroxide:


                                          Na+ + ОH¯→ NaOH



                                                   58
The chlorine gas is then fed through titanium heat exchangers, where it is cooled with circulating water
and fed to drying towers. Wet chlorine gas undergoes drying with 98% sulphuric acid to reduce its
moisture content to at least 150 ppm.
The current unit was first commissioned in 1986.
Area 1-3 c: Caustic Soda Production
Spent cell liquor from the electrolysis cells contains NaOH at a concentration of 110-140 g/l which is
pumped into an Evaporation Area (Area 1-3ac), where, at least 44 % caustic soda (NaOH) is formed
through a 3-stage evaporation, part of which is used for the operation’s own needs and the remaining
part is sold.
Quicklime is produced in a Lime Separation Section by limestone calcining in lime kilns and is used for
production of calcium chloride solution and waste water neutralization. Lime surplus is sold to outside
consumers. The resultant flue gas by-products are used for the treatment of brine supplied to
electrolysis and for production of caustic soda needed for acetylene production from natural gas.
Year of commissioning 1936;
Design capacity         50 000 t/year in terms of lime;
Actual capacity         15 800 t/year;           (nominal due to idling)
The last large scale revamp of this section took place in 1983.
Part of this equipment needs complete replacement. For the remaining part, some parts and
assemblies should be replaced.
Area 1-20: Liquid Chlorine Production
Dried chlorine gas is compressed and is either used for chlorine liquefaction in the Chlorine
Liquefaction Area (1-20) if the plant is operating to produce butadiene rubber, or used for the
production of hydrogen chloride and 31% hydrochloric acid, if the plant is producing acetylene rubber.
This latter production mode also uses electrolytic hydrogen with minimum concentration of 98%.
The Chlorine Liquefaction and Chlorine Gas Production section was commissioned in 1980 with a
design capacity of 60 000 tonnes per year of liquid chlorine. Chlorine liquefaction is a combined one
stage process, which yields liquid chlorine at a pressure of 2.5 kg/cm2 (2.42 atm) when cooled with
brine at -30°С. Hydrogen chloride production is based on the combustion of hydrogen in chlorine gas
in specially designed furnaces.
Hydrogen chloride is used as a feed in Area 1-12ab, for MonoVinylAcetylene (MVA) hydrochlorination,
which in turn is used for chloroprene production.
Hydrogen Chloride and Synthetic Hydrochloric Acid Section has the following nominal capacity:
       34 000 ton/year of hydrogen chloride
       23 000 ton/year of synthetic hydrochloric acid
Liquefaction off-gases containing 45-80% of chlorine are either delivered to produce hydrochloric acid
or supplied to the off-gases neutralization unit to produce commercial sodium hypochlorite (Area 1-
20) according to the following reaction:
                                 2NaOH + Cl2 NaCl + NaOCl + H2O

General Condition of the Chlor-Alkali Unit
The general condition of the Chlor-Alkali process unit is such that it cannot be at present operated.
The building infrastructure is dilapidated and is in need of major repair. Over the last 20 years, it has
been operated at a reduced capacity and with the minimum of maintenance required to keep this
process unit operational.
There is a wider question is that the present chlor-alkali electrolyser technology is based on asbestos
diaphragm electrolysis, thereby resulting in asbestos waste. The performance indicators at Nairit also
show that the unit is rather inefficient in terms of electric power consumption when compared to both
membrane and modern diaphragm electrolysis units. Given the present outdated control systems, it
is also very labour intensive.
Since the plant has not been operated, the unit has benefited from some works. Critically, Nairit have
gone some way towards repairing the existing electrolysers , as well unloaded the redundant piping
from the overhead piperacks, restored enclosed chlorine storage tankage, as well as replaced some
columns in the chlorine drying section (by means of relocation of spare equipment from acetylene
extraction unit) and enforced general housekeeping.
In principle, the unit may be restored for operation, if chloroprene monomer production via acetylene
is to be entertained. The process unit does require further additional investment to remedy its current
condition, with the magnitude of investment highly dependent on the proposed capacity of the unit.
The type of works required is summarised below.
12 kta of Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) production via acetylene:
       Restore brine wells at Abovyan and associated tankage and pumps
       Install new 42 km brine pipeline between Abovyan wells and the main site
       Install new brine storage on site
       Restore lime kiln (for Na2CO3 production, necessary to purify the brine).
       Replace the cathode grids of the electrolysers,
       Complete the refractory works on the replaced columns in the chlorine drying unit
       Install additional columns in the chlorine drying unit
       Install / replace existing chlorine compressors
       Install a number of new pumps (generally)
       Install new rotors for the existing centrifuge(s) within NaOH evaporation area.
       Install new H2SO4 solution storage (for chlorine drying)
       Install new HCl production unit equipment
       Further reinforce a number of supporting structures, especially that of the hypochlorite
        column, as well as install chemically resistant floors.
       There is a large number of equipment that has not been tested for operation since 2010-
        2012 period and thus poses a degree of uncertainty as to its suitability of operation.
       Purchase of adequate spares to enable reliable unit operation.
       Install a number of interconnecting pipe connections
       Install new instrumentation, associated cabling and new Direct Control System (DCS), together
        with new operators’ room.

                                                   63
       Largely replace and reinstall insulation where necessary, due to poor condition of the present.
       Restore drainage
24 kta of Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) production via acetylene:
       In addition to the works listed above, a subsequent expansion to 24 kta of production would
        largely require the same type of works. The obvious difference is the magnitude of works and
        the number of equipment that may be replaced / repaired, so as to reach this capacity. For
        example, it is thought that the existing electrolysers may be brought back into production
        relatively cost effectively for a 12 kta scenario, given the rather large number of units that are
        redundant, allowing to interchange internals where necessary during the repair works.
        Conversely, for the 24 kta of PCR production scenario, additional and more substantial costs
        will be required to ensure that the electrolysers overall capacity is adequate.
       However, for other types of works, the cost is roughly the same. For example, the brine
        pipeline involves largely the same costs regardless whether it supplies the site for 12 kta or 24
        kta of PCR production, since the difference is down to a notional increase in the pipeline
        diameter, but all of the installation costs are still the same.

Utilities Supply
The following list of issues was noted with regards to the Chlor-Alkali unit:
       Area 1-4 a, b: Brine Production & Treatment requires new water well.
       Area 1-3 b: Electrolysis Cells will be replaced with membrane units, so it is assumed that
        adequate utilities supply and return lines will be part of that scope.
       Area 1-3 a, c: Caustic Soda Production will be replaced (as above), so it is assumed that
        adequate utilities supply and return lines will be part of that scope.
       Area 1-3 d: Sulphuric Acid Transfer Area will be replaced, so it is assumed that adequate
        utilities supply and return lines will be part of that scope.
       Area 1-20: Liquid Chlorine Production will be replaced, so it is assumed that adequate utilities
        supply and return lines will be part of that scope.

Unit Operability & Condition of the Process Instrumentation and Control
Systems
The overall process unit control is manual, operated by field operators on a pneumatic control system,
whereby measurements are made by local instrumentation. While this is an acceptable mode of
operation, it is an outdated one, having largely been replaced with automatic distributed control
system (DCS). There are a large number of field operating staff in the Chlor-Alkali unit is also a safety
concern.


We consider that a new DCS system is required to bring the unit to modern standards of operation.
The introduction of the DCS system will allow the site/business/plant management to clearly identify
performance improvement measures to further maximise project returns, maintain a clear log of
environmental performance, as well as reduce the manning to a more manageable level.


                                                   65
During our site visit, Nairit have confirmed that in the event of a restart of production, their intention
is to switch to a new DCS and have shown that their respective designs for such system are in a fairly
advanced stage.

Acetylene Production from Natural Gas
The acetylene produced within this unit, is used as the main raw material for the production of the
chloroprene monomer. The unit also co-produces synthesis gas, which at present is utilised for fuel
needs. Nairit are considering the possibility to route this synthesis gas for additional chemical or liquid
fuel production, so as to increase by-product credit and therefore lower the costs of production of the
chloroprene monomer. However, in order for this to be achieved, a new dedicated production unit
must be erected.
Each area is reviewed in more detail below.

Process Overview
Area 1-6: Air Separation Unit, ASU
Initially, according to the design, an air intake for the ASU was located 10 km away. However, due to
dilapidation of the facilities and equipment, the air intake was moved closer and is now located 3 km
away. The ASU process area is divided into two sub-units:
       General ASU
        This sub-unit originally included 3 Soviet “BR-1?? type ASUs, producing 95 vol.% oxygen and
        97 vol.% nitrogen. These units were initially commissioned in 1964.
        A single Soviet “BR-1?? type ASU had a design capacity of 10 000 – 11 000 Nm³/hr of 95 vol%
        oxygen. Only one unit remains in a barely operable condition, achieving
        8 000–8 500 Nm³/hr of 93-95 vol.% oxygen.
       Additional High Purity Nitrogen Section
        This sub-unit originally included 3 Soviet “AK-1.5? type ASUs, producing 99.999 vol.% nitrogen.
        These units were initially commissioned in 1978.
        A single Soviet “AK-1.5? type ASU had a design capacity 1 750 Nm³/hr of 99.999 vol.% nitrogen.
        Two units remain in an adequate operating condition.
Area 1-7 a,b: Methane Partial Oxidation (POX) Unit
The acetylene production process via partial thermal oxidation was based on the German “BASF?
Sachsse-Bartholomé water quench process, but the bulk of the equipment was manufactured within
USSR, with the exception of compressors which were supplied by German “GHH?.
Year of commissioning:            1965
Original Design capacity:                 75 000 tonnes/annum
Current capacity:                         10 000 tonnes/annum


Natural Gas from the Yerevan city grid and oxygen from Area 1-6 are pre-heated to circa 600ºC in their
dedicated pre-heaters and fed to the POx reactors’ proprietary burners, where, natural gas is partially
oxidised to acetylene and syngas components, using the direct heat of reaction provided by the in-
situ combustion of natural gas. The reactions can be approximately summarised as follows:


                            2CH4 + 2O2CO2 + CO + H2O + 3H2 + Q(Heat)

                                                    66
                                CH4 + O2 CO + H2O + H2 – Q(Heat)
                                    2CH4 C2H2 + 3H2– Q(Heat)


The resultant cracked gases from the POX reactor, containing up to 8% acetylene, are then quenched
and passed through an electrostatic filter, a water scrubber and a wet cyclone to remove as much soot
as possible, before being fed to a pre-scrubber, where they are mixed with recycle CO2 and subjected
to an oil wash to remove any residual soot, naphthalene or polymers arising from acetylene cracking
and polymerisation.
The resultant grey water from the quench vessels, electrostatic filters, the scrubbers and the wet
cyclones is collected together and sent to a soot removal and incineration unit for further disposal.
The original design for this process area (Area 1-7 a, b) included six separate acetylene partial oxidation
lines, each of which is made up of the following process units:
       One Natural Gas Pre-Heater
       One Oxygen Pre-Heater
       One POX Reactor+Quench Vessel
       One Water Scrubber
       One Electrostatic Precipitator
These six lines are then fed to three oil wash pre-scrubbers (one per each two POx lines). During the
last years of operation, they have only operated 2 POx lines, feeding one pre-scrubber. The remainder
of the process equipment has been slowly decommissioned and taken apart for spare parts.
The cracked gas from the top of the pre-scrubber is sent to a cracked gas collector and fed to a
dedicated a five stage raw gas compressor, where it is compressed up to 8-9 atmospheres. Originally,
there were three compressors units in parallel, but in the last 20 years they have only operated one
unit at a time, keeping another one on stand-by and gradually using up the third one for spare parts.
Due to the constant cracking of acetylene, the compressors’ suction lines often foul up and have to be
cleaned at an approximate monthly interval. This is a dangerous activity, as some residual acetylene
is present and comes in contact with air. The soot vent line is not connected to a dedicated flare and
at present is vented to the atmosphere. The compressors are manually controlled.
Soot Removal and Incineration Unit
The incoming grey water is fed to six parallel settling tanks at a sufficient velocity to enable the soot
to float to the top of the process water, where it is then scooped up by a mechanical arm. The wet
soot is then fed to the cyclone furnaces, where it is incinerated to produce steam. Plant operators
commented that this is an unreliable part of operation, as the soot pulp feeding nozzles often block
with soot.




Area 1-7 c: NMP Absorption Cycle
Compressed raw gas from the compressor hall is then passed to Area 1-7b, where it is fed to the
bottom of the NMP absorber columns, which selectively absorb acetylene. Originally there were five
NMP absorption sub-units, but at present only one remains in an operating condition, effectively
limiting the whole unit to 10 kta of acetylene.



                                                    67
The loaded NMP solution leaves the bottom of the absorber column. The remaining gas is removed
from the top as a syngas by-product stream and used as fuel gas elsewhere on site. The loaded solution
is fed to the bottom of the stripper column, where both acetylene and residual CO2 are selectively
extracted. CO2 is recycled back to the pre-scrubber, so as to purge it into the syngas stream, whereas
acetylene is sent to the gas-holders for check buffer storage, before being sent to the Chloroprene
Production Unit.

General Condition of the Acetylene Production Unit
The general condition of the Acetylene Production Unit is very poor. We consider that the present
condition of the unit does not allow for safe and environmentally safe operation. The process
equipment generally appeared to be very old, with significant exterior corrosion and welding scars
where ‘patching up work’ was done. The process controls are antiquated and do not appear
appropriate for such a delicate process. There are no gas detectors and the flare headers seem to be
corroded. Currently only one ASU, two POX reactors, two compressors and one NMP absorbent cycle
were in a condition that may be considered as adequate for operation, albeit with signs of heavy wear.
Restart of production at this unit will require a major capital investment.
A further point must be made about the efficiency of the present equipment. Thus, the existing ASU
unit is about 50% less efficient than its modern analogue in terms of power consumption. Nairit
themselves have indicated that a new ASU unit is proposed for both acetylene scenarios.
Likewise, the natural gas consumption of the Partial Oxidation (POx) unit per tonne of acetylene is
around 8,500 Nm³/hr of natural gas. This is around 30% higher than design and 40% than best achieved
by BASF at their own facility at Ludwigshafen, Germany. Thus, in the event of acetylene route scenario
being chosen, it is highly recommended that BASF are approached and engaged throughout to
improve the performance of the POx unit.
A more detailed overview of the type of works required is summarised below.
12 kta of Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) production via acetylene:
       New Air Separation Unit (ASU) is required (inclusive of buffer storage and product gases
        compression).
       The interconnecting pipework between the ASU site and the main site will need to undergo
        large integrity assessment and undergo localised repairs.
       New oxygen compression will be required at the main site.
       New acetylene production unit
        o   While there may be an argument that some of the equipment is salvageable for future
            operation, such operation will most certainly fall short of what is considered as good
            practice or compliant with international standards for acetylene production. Given the
            explosive nature of acetylene, we consider it is too dangerous an approach, especially
            considering the location of Nairit within city limits.
       New cracked gas compressors
       New acetylene extraction unit
       New acetylene gas holder
       Purchase of adequate spares to enable reliable unit operation.
       Install a number of interconnecting pipe connections, in particular due to safety issues;
        o   New oxygen lines
        o   New cracked gas collector lines
       Install new instrumentation, associated cabling and new Direct Control System (DCS), together
        with new operators’ room.
       Largely replace and reinstall insulation where necessary, due to poor condition of the present.
       Restore drainage


                                                  70
24 kta of Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) production via acetylene:
       In addition to the works listed above, a subsequent expansion to 24 kta of production would
        largely require the same works. The obvious difference is the scale of the unit will double,
        which will require some additional equipment. However, most of the capacity increase should
        be met through equipment sizes increase rather than additional equipment being bought and
        purchased in parallel.

The general condition of pipe racks and their supporting pylons varies from adequate to poor and thus
some will have to be replaced. As a general comment, there is a lot of redundant equipment and scrap
materials scattered across the Acetylene Production Unit plot space. This must be cleaned up and
stored in a designated area. It should not be located near a live operating unit.

Utilities Supply
The following list of issues was noted with regards to the Acetylene Production Unit:
       Area 1-6:        New dedicated CW cycle will be required adjacent to the ASU
       Area 1-6:        A new gaseous oxygen (GOX) holder for interim storage is required
       Area 1-7a:       New CW cycle will be required
       Area 1-7a:       A new cracked gases holder for interim storage is required
       Area 1-7a,b:     The chemical sewer will have to be rechecked for integrity
These issues are ancillary, as we do not recommend the restart of this unit due to its lack of economic
competitiveness, associated safety and environmental issues, as well as the expected lack of reliability
due to general wear and tear.

Unit Operability & Condition of the Process Instrumentation and
Control Systems
The overall process unit control is manual, operated by field operators on a pneumatic control system,
whereby measurements are made by local instrumentation. While this is an acceptable mode of
operation, it is an outdated one, having largely been replaced with digital DCS control systems. A large
number of field operating staff, due to manual control system that is at present implemented in the
Acetylene Production Unit, is also a safety concern.
We consider that a new DCS system is required to bring the unit up to modern standards of operation.
The introduction of the DCS system will allow management to clearly identify performance
improvement measures to further maximise project returns, maintain a clear log of environmental
performance as well as reduce the manning to a more manageable level.
During our site visit, Nairit have confirmed that in the event of a restart of production, their intention
is to switch to a new DCS and have shown that their respective designs for such system are in a fairly
advanced stage.
Venting
A particular concern was the past venting practice in this unit, in particular the purging and release of
soot which is environmentally undesirable poor and requires urgent general attention. For example,
there was evidence of certain practices with regards to clearing of the accumulated soot in the cracked
gas pipework, whereby some of the cracked gas together with the soot was vented together to
atmosphere resulting in large amounts of particulates being released to the atmosphere within
Yerevan city limits.
This is an unacceptably poor environmental practice and requires a management initiative to radically
change the operating culture on site, in order to prevent safety incidents which will inevitably cause
expensive down time due to loss of production.

Chloroprene Production Unit
Process Overview – Chloroprene Production from Acetylene
This is one of the oldest units on-site, although it has been completely refurbished throughout its
operation on this site. It was first commissioned in 1940 with a capacity to supply enough chloroprene
monomer for 7 kta of PCR rubber based on acetylene produced via the Calcium Carbide process at the
time, which existed at an adjacent location. The unit was progressively expanded to reach a capacity
of 75 kta in 1970s, but was shut down in 1985 due to the introduction of the butadiene route for
chloroprene monomer production.
The fall of the USSR, and the consequent disruption in butadiene supply to site, has led to the restart
of the unit at a demonstration capacity in 1994, so as to enable PCR rubber production on site. The
unit largely followed 1970s design, with a few control loop improvements. The equipment and process
control systems contained in this demonstration unit were partly salvaged from the previously
operating chloroprene unit, which was shut down in 1985.
Effective Start-up Date: 1994
Design Capacity:                10 kta of Chloroprene Monomer
Actual Capacity:        9 kta of Chloroprene Monomer
Chloroprene Production from Acetylene is divided into three following process areas:
       Area 1-12a:     Chloroprene Production Unit (Acetylene) – MVA synthesis
       Area 1-12b:     Chloroprene Production Unit (Acetylene) – MVA hydrochlorination
       Area 1-19:      Liquid and Chlorinated Waste Incineration


Area 1-12a: Chloroprene Production Unit (Acetylene) – MVA Synthesis
Area 1-12a contains the following Sections:
       Acetylene Feed Compression
       Acetylene Dimerization Synthesis (Fluidized bed) to Mono-Vinyl-Acetylene (MVA)
       Drying and MVA absorption by Toluene
       Catalyst (CuCl/NH4Cl solution) preparation and regeneration
Acetylene Compression & Dimerization Synthesis
Acetylene from Buffer Storage Gas Holders is fed to the compression section of the Area 1-12a, where
it is compressed in Liquid-Ring Compressors to approximately 1.9 bar a, mixed with safety superheated
steam (which preheats to 70°C) and fed to the bottom of the Dimerization Reactor, where it is allowed
to bubble through a weak HCl acid / catalyst (CuCl/NH4Cl) solution at about 80-85°C, and thus convert
to Mono-Vinyl-Acetylene (MVA) via the following reaction:
                                              2C2H2→ C4H4
                                          C2H2 + C4H4→ C6H6
Other by-products of the reaction include Vinyl Chloride, Acetaldehyde, as well as higher waste
polymers, which are consequence of the acetylene’s and MVA’s high propensity to polymerise.
Dimerization solid waste is a resin, made of higher polymers and up to 17% of copper. This solid waste
is periodically taken out to the city’s landfill.



                                                  73
Drying and MVA absorption by Toluene
Saturated effluent gas exiting the top of the MVA synthesis reactor is first passed through an overhead
KO pot, where some of the condensate is removed and passed through a series of sCRubbers where
it is first washed with water and then brine solution to further chill the gases to -7°C to -10°C, which
both dries the effluent gas and scrubs out waste polymers.
SCRubbed effluent gas is then passed through a series of toluene absorbers where MVA and other
light by-products of MVA synthesis are counter-currently contacted with toluene solvent. The
remaining acetylene gas, as well as inerts, is then split, with the bulk recycled to the Acetylene
production unit’s NMP absorber cycle for acetylene recovery, whereas a small purge stream is taken
off, further scrubbed with toluene solvent and sent to an atmospheric vent. Loaded toluene solution
leaves the bottom of the first absorber and is pumped to Area 1-12b for further synthesis to
chloroprene.
Catalyst Preparation Area
This area consists of a single open roof vessel, which is used to mix HCl, ammonia and manually added
bars of copper to prepare adequate strength solution for MVA synthesis.
Area     1-12b:       Chloroprene                Production          Unit        (Acetylene)          –
MVA hydrochlorination
Area 1-12b contains the following Sections:
       Mono-Vinyl-Acetylene (MVA) Extraction and Desorption (from Toluene),
       MVA Hydrochlorination Synthesis (to Chloroprene)
       Chloroprene Distillation
Mono-Vinyl-Acetylene (MVA) Extraction and Desorption
Loaded toluene solution is partially pre-heated and fed to a phase separator, where it is contacted
counter-currently with off gases from the chloroprene distillation section, in order to strip out most
of the dissolved acetylene. The gases are then recycled back to the feed point of the first toluene
absorber within Area 1-12a. Loaded toluene solvent is then fed to a toluene desorber column, where
remaining acetylene, MVA and other MVA synthesis by-products are steam reboiled out of the solvent
at about 130ºC (thus catching some of the toluene) and removed overhead via a condensing cooler
within the desorber column. The remaining toluene, recovered at the bottom of the column, is split,
with a side-stream sent through a batch distillation process to remove fouling waste polymers that
form due to MVA’s high reactivity. Regenerated solvent is then chilled and returned to the process.
Gas exiting the desorber column is then fed to the first MVA distillation column, which is used to
recover vapour losses of toluene from the desorber column, as well as remove MVA and acetaldehyde
from DVA and other heavier hydrocarbons. Gaseous MVA and acetaldehyde are condensed in several
stages (by indirect cooling with water and refrigerant brine solution) and then washed with water in a
dedicated scrubbing column. The resulting acetaldehyde solution from the bottom of the scrubbing
column is then recycled back to the toluene absorption cycle, whereas the washed gas is almost
acetaldehyde free, so it is then fed to a second MVA distillation column, to remove the last traces of
acetaldehyde and DVA, via a calcium chloride dryer. The bottoms from this column are recycled back
to Area 1-12a and used to scrub the MVA reactor effluent gas. MVA product (99.99 wt.%) is taken off
at the top, condensed in a series of water and refrigerant brine solution condensers, collected in a
dedicated holder vessel, from where it is pumped to MVA Hydrochlorination Synthesis section. All of
the MVA distillation columns are operated at slightly above atmospheric pressure due to safety
considerations associated with handling a highly concentrated MVA stream.



                                                  74
MVA Hydrochlorination Synthesis (to Chloroprene)
Liquid MVA from the holding vessel is diluted in process water and is vaporised under saturated
conditions by superheated steam addition. The resultant vapour is fed to the bottom of the
hydrochlorination synthesis reactor at a temperature of 40-50ºC, where it is bubbled through a weak
HCl acid / catalyst (CuCl/NH4Cl) solution. The make-up HCl reagent is added as a 15 % weak HCl acid
solution to one of the three reactor risers. Notably, both ammonia and copper make-ups are also
added continuously to maintain the correct concentration of the catalyst and the acid, so that the
following reactions take place:
    1) Hydrochlorination:
                         CH2=CH–C≡CH              + HCl →       CH2Cl–CH=C=CH3
                         (MVA)                          (chloro-4-buta-1,2-diene)
    2) Isomerisation:
                         CH2Cl–CH=C=CH3                   →       CH2=CCl–CH=CH2
                         (chloro-4-butadiene-1, 2)                (2-chlorobuta-1,3-diene)
                                                                  (β-chloroprene)

    3) Undesired side reaction due to excessive HCl:
                     CH2=CCl–CH=CH2         + HCl →               CH3–CCl=CH–CH2Cl
                     (β-chloroprene)                              (2,4-di-chloro-2-butene)


Other by-products of the reaction include Methyl Vinyl Ketone (MVK) and higher dimers and waste
polymers, which are a consequence of chloroprene reactivity and residence time in the reactor. The
gas effluent from the top of the reactor contains chloroprene, di-chloro-butenes, MVK, steam and HCl
and is fed to the bottom of the wet MVA recovery column, where most of the unreacted MVA is
recovered as a wet condensate stream in the overhead chiller/condenser system and returned back
to the hydrochlorination reactor.
The remaining non-condensable gases are then fed to a MVA recovery column #1, where they are
scrubbed against MVA recovery column #2 bottoms, to further recover MVA and chloroprene. The
remaining inert gas stream is then washed with caustic and vented to atmosphere. The bottoms
product, loaded with MVA is sent to the crude chloroprene collector.
Bottom product from the wet MVA recovery column #1 is collected in a settling vessel to separate out
the aqueous phase. The resultant organic phase is then further indirectly chilled using brine refrigerant
solution, passed through a calcium chloride dryer and is then sent to the crude chloroprene collector,
where it is mixed with the bottoms product from the chloroprene recovery column.
Chloroprene Distillation
Crude chloroprene is pumped from its collector drum to a light ends chloroprene column, where MVA
is recovered as a condensate in an overhead CW condenser / brine refrigerant chiller system. The
remaining off-gases are then passed through MVA recovery column #2, where they are washed to
recover MVA vapours prior to venting to atmosphere. The bottoms of the light ends chloroprene
column are collected in a dedicated degassed crude chloroprene collector vessel, from where they are
pumped to the final product distillation column, where chloroprene it is separated from di-chloro-
butenes, collected in the overhead CW condenser / brine refrigerant chiller system as a condensate
and further passed through a final calcium chloride dryer before being sent to polymerisation. The
dichlorides are collected as a bottom by-product and at present are incinerated. The remaining off-
gases are ejected to the fuel gas system.

Area 1-19: Liquid Waste Incineration
Liquid and chlorinated waste from chloroprene production is thermally destroyed in this unit by co-
firing it with natural gas, in order to capture some of its energy value as steam and dispose of the
hazardous wastes. The flue gas is cooled and scrubbed with caustic to capture any traces of HCl.
Saturated steam is produced at the pressure of 13 atm. (g) as a by-product.
Year of commissioning: 1981.
Design capacity:                                  1.4 t/hr of liquid wastes
Actual capacity:                       1.1 t/hr

General Condition of the Chloroprene Production Unit – Acetylene
The general condition of the equipment contained within this process area inadequate for production
restart, due to wrong choice of materials of construction, generally old equipment coming to the end
of its useful operating life, localised heavy corrosion associated with a process of this nature, as well
as insufficient maintenance over the years. In particular, both dimerization synthesis and MVA
hydrochlorination reaction sections do not appear safe and will need to be replaced. There is a large
number of equipment that is made from materials not suitable for handling acids or brines or
ammonium chloride catalyst that are present in the system. If this production unit is to be restarted
the equipment that is not already protected via acid resistant tiling will require replacing to ensure
adequate materials of construction are used such as certain types of FRP (Fibre Reinforced Plastic)11.
         Thus, all equipment and process lines around both dimerization section and hydrochlorination
section that are made from carbon steel; should either be replaced by equipment made from a more
suitable acid resistant material. Thus, we consider that the present condition of the overall unit does
not allow for safe and environmentally friendly operation. Given that this section deals mostly with
explosive, toxic and corrosive substances, there is a fundamental question of safety of operation.
The process controls are antiquated and do not appear appropriate for such a delicate process. There
are no gas detectors in the area and we did not see that operators are provided with adequate PPE.
The operator house is located in the direct vicinity of the process, and will need to be moved. Nairit
have indicated that in the event of a restart, the operators’ house will be relocated.
In 2009, there was a serious explosion in the section of the plant where MVA is desorbed from toluene,
which led to 4 fatalities and blast wave damage around the site and to adjacent buildings. Of particular
concern is that this unit seems to be located so close to the public road, posing significant danger to
civilians outside the plant. Thus, the whole section will need to be relocated further away from public
roadways, and other unit areas, to ensure safe operation of the site overall.
Restart of production at this unit will require a major capital investment, as most of the unit needs
to be replaced, part of it relocated to a different plot location and fully refurbished for modern
operation.
A more detailed overview of the type of works required is summarised below.
12 kta of Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) production via acetylene:
          New dimerization catalyst preparation unit
          At least one new dimerization reactor is required, and the existing reactors must undergo
           checks for adequacy of internal acid resistant tiles, as well as the inner corrosion of the outer
           steel shells, before they can be declared safe to operate.
           o    Even though the existing reactors are lined with acid resistant tiles, there is evidence of
                corrosion on the outer shells, which suggests that the lining is not adequate and results
                in corrosive fluids permeating through.
           o    If long term operation is to be considered, FRP is a safer and more cost effective choice of
                material of construction than internal lining with acid resistant tiles.
          Reinforce dimerization section supporting structure
          New hydrochlorination reactors will be required.
          Most of the process columns will also need to be replaced. The existing units suffer from either
           corrosion, gumming up or both.

     E.g. Epoxy Vinyl Ester Resins (EVER) can be used in applications where up to 200°C service is required

                                                         78
    o   Major column equipment has not be tested or inspected in detail since at least the plant
        has shutdown (5 years).
    o   Operation of carbon steel equipment with fluids containing acids, brines, ammonium
        chloride catalyst as well as moisture, is bound to result in excessive corrosion and
        therefore jeopardize the safety of the overall plant.
    o   Brine scrubber column is made from carbon steel, which will result in excessive corrosion
        during operation of the unit. Same issues as outlined above.
    o   Even toluene absorber is at danger of having unacceptable levels of internal corrosion due
        to brine carry over that has very likely occurred over years of operation.
    o   Similarly, chloroprene monomer distillation column is made from carbon steel, whereas
        it receives a feed line from the hydrochlorination reactor that is likely to contain traces of
        HCl.
    o   There is also a question of polymer gums and resins that were formed as part of previous
        operation and whether these can be removed without damaging equipment.
    o   In all cases, it is recommended that any metal column internals are also inspected and
        replaced with more efficient FRP analogues where possible.
    o   Conversely, internal refitting of the existing units (to install new corrosion resistant lining)
        will also pose a very significant cost, where the level of safety afforded is much lower,
        since the lining may be cracked or damaged during installation or subsequent
        maintenance, denying its protective function.
   Most process heat exchanger equipment will require replacing / undergo reconstruction so as
    to ensure protection of the surfaces exposed to acids, brines and catalyst traces that almost
    certainly are present in the system, for reasons outlined in the previous comment.
   New compression equipment throughout
   New heavy residue storage tanks.
   New toluene solvent storage tank.
   Chloroprene monomer distillation unit will need to be relocated away from current position
    due to its proximity to public road, which poses a danger to the public.
   A new waste incineration unit is required.
   Works related to the final chloroprene monomer neutralisation, as well as those required
    for    the       NO     inhibitor      production     unit     (both      located       within
    Area 1-18), are covered as part of the butadiene section discussion (please refer to p. 2-101)
   Purchase of adequate spares to enable reliable unit operation.
   Replace interconnecting carbon steel pipe connections with FRP.
   Install new instrumentation, associated cabling and new Direct Control System (DCS), together
    with new operators’ room.
   Largely replace and reinstall insulation where necessary, due to poor condition of the present.
   Restore drainage
   Install suitable acid resistant flooring to manage any process spillages in an environmental
    responsible way

24 kta of Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) production via acetylene:
         In addition to the works listed above, a subsequent expansion to 24 kta of production would
          largely require the same works, as well as:
         Install additional 3 dimerization reactors, together with accompanying supporting structure.
         New hydrochlorination reactors will need to be resized to accommodate for new flows. This
          will also require the redesign of the existing section that houses both hydrochlorination and
          final chloroprene monomer distillation.

Source: Jacobs Consulting Ltd.
The general condition of pipe racks and their supporting pylons ranges from adequate to poor, and
thus will have to be reviewed should this unit be placed in operation again.
Liquid and Chlorinated Waste Incinerator
At present, the site has four separate incinerator units, based on a soviet GosNIIChlorProject12 design.
The condition of these units is extremely poor owing to years of operation in a highly corrosive
environment without adequate funds being made available for their maintenance.
The Jacobs Consultancy team has not been convinced that the existing incinerators, even after
proposed refurbishment, will be able to reliably destroy chlorinated organics and meet the latest
environmental discharge regulations. Emissions of dioxins are a particular concern, owing to short
residence times. EU BAT specify at least 2 seconds of residence time are required to ensure dioxins
destruction, whereas the present unit even lacks measurements to confirm these.

It is therefore proposed that 2 x 50 new incinerator units are procured. These packages can be
procured from well-known international vendors such as John Zink, Zeeco or Caloric, specialising in
supply of halogenated waste thermal oxidizer systems.
Utilities Supply
The following list of issues was noted with regards to the Chloroprene Production from Acetylene Unit:
       Area 1-12a, b: The chemical sewer will have to be rechecked for integrity
       Area 1-19:         New Chlorinated and Liquids Waste Incinerator is required
       New CW supply is presumed

Unit Operability & Condition of the Process Instrumentation and Control
systems – Acetylene based Chloroprene Production
The overall process unit control is manual, operated by field operators on a pneumatic control system,
whereby measurements are made by local instrumentation. We consider this is an unacceptable mode
of operation for such a dangerous process and an outdated one. We cannot recommend this process
to be operated without installation of a new digital DCS control system, which will minimise the
amount of personnel and their time spent in the vicinity of the process unit. A large number of field
operating staff allocated to this unit is an added safety concern, due to the increase in likely human
cost of a potential operation incident.
Venting
A particular concern was the venting practice in this unit, in particular the purging and release of soot
which is very poor and requires urgent general attention. For example, there was evidence of certain
practices with regards to clearing of the accumulated soot in the cracked gas pipework, whereby some
of the cracked gas together with the soot was vented together to atmosphere resulting in large
amounts of particulates being released to the atmosphere within Yerevan city limits.
This is unacceptably poor environmental practices and requires a management initiative to radically
change the operating culture on site, in order to prevent safety incidents which will invariably cause
expensive down time due to loss of production.

PolyChloroprene Production Unit
Process Overview – PolyChloroprene Production
Nairit’s Polychloroprene production unit has been licensed from DuPont and was installed by a
Japanese contractor in 1986.


        Start-up Date:            1986.
        Design Capacity:          50 kta
        Actual Capacity:          25 kta
        Planned Revamp:           +10 kta


Area 1-21: 2,3-DCB co-monomer Production and Recovery of Recycled CR
Area 1-21 is intended for production of 2,3-dichlorobutadiene-1,3 co-monomer, which is used within
the polymerisation area 1-22 together with chloroprene, as well as additional treatment of the



                                                   81
chloroprene product (which is derived from acetylene if the plant is operating the acetylene route) or
for recovery of recycled chloroprene from Area 1-22.
2,3-dichlorobutadiene-1,3 (2, 3 DCB) Production:
This process unit uses some of 1, 3-DCB available from the Chloroprene Production Unit (butadiene
route) to produce necessary quantities of 2, 3-DCB co-monomer on a batch basis. 2, 3-DCB co-
monomer is used for the production of certain grades of chloroprene rubber, as it helps to restrict the
crystallisation tendency of the PCR chain. The unit itself was licensed from DuPont and comprises of
the following stages:
       1,3-dichlorobutene-2 Chlorination
       1,2,3-trichlorobutene-3 Distillation
       1,2,3-trichlorobutene-3 Dehydrochlorination
       2,3-dichlorobutadiene-1,3 Distillation
The unit capacity is 5.8kta (based on 7,200 operating hr/annum).
The unit has been mothballed since 1992, but it did not appear to be in an overly poor state. This unit
is not essential to PCR production, but its absence does restrict the range of PCR products that Nairit’s
plant will be able to produce. The unit is missing all of its instrumentation.
Distillation of acetylene based and recycled Chloroprene
Nairit carried out the design of this section in-house, using equipment and utilities available on site at
the time, in order to accelerate the commissioning of the Chloroprene Production Unit (based on
Acetylene) in 1994, due to perceived CAPEX savings and lack of available plot space within the
Chloroprene Production Unit (Area 1-12). The purpose of the unit is to distil out the inert α-
chloroprene and thus improve the specification of the processed chloroprene. The unit capacity is 30
kta of recycle chloroprene (based on 7200 operating hr/annum).
Unfortunately, this sub-unit has not been adequately maintained and is in need of capital repair. Since
it has been taken offline, Nairit operators have used the back end distillation equipment of the
butadiene based Chloroprene Production Unit (Area 1-18) instead. Thus, chloroprene derived from
either butadiene or acetylene must undergo final distillation within Area 1-18 of the Chloroprene
Production unit. At present, this distillation unit is not critical for operation at 35 kta of PCR capacity,
due to the possibility of using the existing equipment within Area 1-18. However, its restoration in the
future, will allow increasing the throughput capacity of Area 1-18 process equipment. The unit
requires installation of new reboilers and pumps
We recommend that no further action to bring this unit online is taken at present, as we do not
recommend that acetylene based production of chloroprene is resumed and the existing chloroprene
production unit based on butadiene (Area 1-18) has enough capacity in its final distillation section to
process the additional chloroprene recycle from the chloroprene polymerisation unit (Area 1-22). It
might be of interest to continue to mothball this unit, with a view for future capacity expansion,
whereby the existing distillation section within Area 1-18 becomes the bottleneck. However, this is
not a present concern.

Area 1-22: Chloroprene Polymerisation
Polymerisation Reactors
Chloroprene from intermediate storage is first collected in a monomer holding drum. The
polymerisation itself is done as a batch process (there are six such reactors in parallel), so a measured
quantity of monomer is pumped from this drum into a monomer holding vessel above each reactor.
At the same time, measured quantities of demineralized water, initiators, promoters, regulators,
emulsifiers, modifying/stabilizing agents and caustic soda is also pumped to their respective holding
vessels above the reactor. Each bin has its own set of weights so that the quantity of each reagent is
correctly measured.
The monomer and demineralized water are then introduced and to the mixture is agitated by means
of an internal stirrer. The exothermic polymerisation reaction is then started by introduction of the
initiator and emulsifier at 35ºC:


        CH2=CCl–CH=CH2                            →          [–CH2–CCl–CH–CH2–] n
        (β-chloroprene)                                      (Polychloroprene)
The extent of polymerisation required varies on the type of rubber that is being made in any particular
batch (see Table D-10 below). The extent of conversion is measured by taking regular samples and
analysing them for density, and this is controlled by varying the flow of a brine refrigerant through the
reactor’s cooling jacket. The polymerisation reaction can be put on hold by maintaining a constant
temperature inside the reactor, while the samples are analysed in the adjacent building’s lab. The end
product of polymerisation is a latex, which is a stable colloidal mixture of polychloroprene and
unreacted chloroprene in an aqueous state.

The product aqueous latex is then discharged into a crude latex holding drum underneath the reactor,
from where it is pumped to the degassing section.




                                                   83
Degassing
Crude latex in its aqueous state is first preheated by direct steam (105ºC) injection to vaporise any
unreacted chloroprene, which is then separated in a two stage cyclone separator system (0.2 bar g
and vacuum), condensed against brine refrigerant and collected in a dedicated unreacted chloroprene
solution tank, from where it is then pumped back to the Chloroprene Production Unit for recovery,
final purification and reuse. Non-condensable gases from the brine chillers are vacuum ejected to
atmosphere.
The resultant 38-40% latex solution is recovered from the bottom of the second cyclone separator and
stored in a check tank under nitrogen blanket for 24 hours to observe latex quality. Latex is not
neutralised at this stage, but a small quantity of mercaptan regulator is added to maintain its stability.
Pilot Unit (Labs)
As part of Area 1-22, there is also a pilot plant facility, which is an exact replica of the polymerisation
unit and as such it is used to test run the entire chain(batch polymerisation, degassing and rubber
extraction). This unit is in a good condition and in the future it will allow Nairit to experiment with
different reagents for polymerisation in order to optimise cost/performance.
Latex Production
Originally, there was also a latex production line, but this has not been maintained and is now
decommissioned.
Area 1-23: Rubber Extraction
Neutralised latex solution from Area 1-22 is pumped onto a rotating cooling drum, which is internally
chilled using brine refrigerant. As the drum rotates, it coagulates the latex contained in the solution
by solidifying it and thus forming a think latex film, allowing the remaining water to be collected
underneath it. Small quantity of acetic acid is added to this tank to neutralise the condensate.
The latex film band is then peeled off the rotating drum and directed through a washing conveyer
where it is washed with water to remove any remaining impurities and fed to a dryer unit which
contains stacks of rotating rolls, allowing the latex film band to be blow dried with hot process air. The
dry latex film band is then cooled on a specially chilled roll and conveyed to a chopping machine,
where talc is added and the rubber is chopped into 2x1 inch irregular rubber ‘chunks’, which can then
be packaged into 25 kg bags and sent to storage as saleable product.

General Condition of the Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) Unit
The condition of the equipment contained within the PCR unit varies. While some of the process units
(such as Area 1-21) have been mothballed and require significant testing, as well as the acquisition of
new process equipment, the critical process equipment appears to be generally in an adequate
condition.
While there was evidence of surface corrosion throughout the unit’s process equipment, those vessels
that we inspected (reactors, cyclones) appeared to be generally corrosion free.
Our major concerns with regards to the present condition of this process unit are as follows:
       Area 1-21’s 2,3 DCB co-monomer production unit has been mothballed since 1992 restricting
        the ability of Nairit to produce a full spectrum of PCR grades. The inability of the plant to
        commercially produce latex grades of PCR will limit the access to certain markets.
       There are insufficient HSE measures taken, so far, with regards to the safe operation of this
        process unit:
        o   The current process includes utilisation of existing atmospheric vents, which will lead to
            some unnecessary halo-hydrocarbon emissions into atmosphere, nor does it contain
            adequate sensors to measure these emissions. Nairit have indicated that the revamp
            design includes routing of such vents to a suitable hydrocarbon collector for safe disposal
            at flare, but this is yet to materialise and will require additional investment.
        o   There are no gas detectors in the area and we did not see that operators are provided
            with adequate PPE.
        o   The ventilation system was in poor condition and must be repaired/renewed.
However, none of these concerns is an overriding one. Commissioning risks can be offset with
adequate careful planning and provision of contingency budgets and schedules. We have assumed
that a new dedicated DCS system will be installed to operate this unit, as suggested by Nairit’s
management and their cost estimate forwarded to us.
A more detailed overview of the type of works required is summarised below.
12 kta of Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) production via acetylene:
       Within section 1-21, we identified a number of main process equipment items that should be
        replaced before the plant re-enters operation. This list is limited to all pumps and reboiler #
        26-132-*1E only. Although 2,3-DCB co-monomer production unit is a very nice add-on, since
        it would allow Nairit to produce a full spectrum of PCR grades and thus expand its market
        reach, it is not essential for start-up and may be brought online once the plant is running.
       In addition to these costs, it will also be necessary to introduce a number of changes to the
        overhead vent within unit 1-21. At present, this vent is expected to discharge small quantities
        of Nitric (I) Oxide, NO, inhibitor and β-chloroprene directly to atmosphere, after dilution with
        nitrogen to bring the concentrations down to safe levels for field operators to be near the
        vent. This is not an acceptable technical solution from the point of view of good international
        practice or for example EU regulations, especially since NO rapidly oxidises to NO2, a major
        pollutant responsible for brown smog from car exhausts. As such, an alternative process
        revamp will be required.
       One solution would be to install a selective catalytic mini-reactor to decompose NO into
        elemental nitrogen and oxygen, using technology readily available for nitric acid plants.
        However, this would still leave the problem of β-chloroprene to be addressed.

       Given the small volume of this stream, the most cost-effective solution would be to pump this
        stream towards the chlorinated liquids waste incinerator, via a collector gas line proposed to
        aggregate process vents from unit 1-18. This would limit the works to simply install a transfer
        line to take NO and β-chloroprene back to unit 1-18, where it will be mixed with process vent
        streams and the aggregate sent to incinerator for disposal. The expected quantity of NO from
        unit 1-21 during normal operations is ~0.5 kg/hr, which is expected to add about ~5-15 ppm
        of NOx to the incinerator emissions (depending on quantity of co-fed liquid waste). This
        solution should be reviewed during engineering design.
       Within section 1-22, based on visual inspection of the process plant equipment and their
        internals, most of the main process equipment items contained within this process unit were
        found to be in a generally adequate condition and of good integrity. However, we note the
        following equipment items need attention:
            o   The main volatile extraction system should be completely replaced to comply with
                European safe exposure limits for the process operators.
            o   It is recommended that all pumps are replaced (for reliability purposes).
            o   The stirrer shaft bearings on the main reaction vessels appear to be in poor condition
                and require further inspection and possible replacement. This is a key process
                management issue where a failure would result in loss of product.
            o   A number of heat exchangers in the overhead system must be replaced.
        The piping in the area appears to be in an adequate condition but there were areas of external
        surface corrosion due to carbon steel surfaces. The true integrity of the piping will not be
        known until the process is re-started but there should be an allowance in the budget to replace
        a significant amount of this piping to ensure process integrity.
        Nairit’s chloroprene polymerisation area has 6 independently operated batch reactors
        installed in parallel. Currently, only 2 are in an operational condition, but the others appear to
        be in an adequate condition, with signs of only minor external surface corrosion but lacking
        instrumentation. We do not expect that Nairit will have to replace these reactors, but a
        detailed investigation must be carried out to determine the cost of the works involved.
       Within section 1-23, based on visual inspection of the process plant equipment and their
        internals, the final product packaging line appears largely adequate for the initial production
        volumes but will require an intensive period of maintenance to bring the line back to full
        commercial production. A new more modern final product packaging line will be required at
        some stage in the future.
24 kta of Polychloroprene Rubber (PCR) production via acetylene:
A major concern is that despite having most of the equipment in place, the existing plant has not been
operated at the proposed 24 kta capacity since 1994 and therefore there is the possibility that last
minute replacements might be required as issues arise during the commissioning process of the
existing lines, various process equipment and associated unit’s pipework may be found unfit for
purpose and will have to be replaced at short notice.
However, in principle all of the major equipment required to achieve production rates of up to 24 kta
is already installed.

Area 1-22: Process Control Building & Labs (including pilot unit)
The building is in good condition, but we anticipate substantial work will be done to fit a new DCS
system for improved process control.
Area 1-23: Rubber Extraction Building
While the building appears to be in a sound structural condition, the following improvements must be
implemented before restarting production:




                                                     89
       Need to contain off the latex freezing drum, latex washing and final cooling rod areas to
        minimise unreacted chloroprene emissions
       Repair parts of the flooring areas with acid resistant tiles
       Repair roof and provide new windows
       Install new gas detectors and chloroprene monitoring devices to measure emissions within
        the operator area.
       New DCS control system
Utilities Supply
The following list of issues was noted with regards to the PCR Unit:
       General:         Lack of firewater supply to the process (generally)
       General:         The chemical sewer will have to be rechecked for integrity
       General:         Need to provide for liquid and gas waste streams from this unit to be routed
                         to the proposed new incinerator for thermal destruction of its hydrocarbon
                         content, prior to release to atmosphere.

Unit Operability & Condition of the process instrumentation and control
systems
At present, the overall process unit control is largely manual, operated by field operators on a
pneumatic control system, whereby measurements are made by local instrumentation. However, the
revamp work cost estimate provided to us by Nairit management includes a suitable cost estimate for
a new DCS to be installed prior to unit restart. We consider this to be the correct approach.
Venting
A particular concern is the current presence of atmospheric vents within the design of this unit, which
will lead to some chloroprene and related compounds being released to the atmosphere within
Yerevan city limits.
This is not current best practice and does not comply with the best available technologies
requirements in the West. We recommend that the design of the plant is reviewed to route these
vents to a suitable source of thermal destruction.

Existing Process Units – Butadiene Route
Summary of Main Process Units (ISBL)
The site comprises of three main Inside Battery Limits (ISBL) units, as well as the necessary utilities
and offsite facilities to enable continuous production. The ISBL units are listed below:
       Chlor-Alkali (C-A) Unit:
       This is the same unit, as per Acetylene route.
       Area 1-1:        Solvay process area for sodium carbonate production
       Area 1-4 a, b:   Brine Production and Treatment
       Area 1-3 a, c:   Caustic Soda (NaOH) Production
       Area 1-3 b:      Brine Electrolysis



                                                   90
       Area 1-5:       Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) production. This unit is not required for butadiene
        route.
       Area 1-20:      Liquid Chlorine and Sodium Hypochlorite Production
       Chloroprene (CR) Monomer Unit:
       Area 1-18: Chloroprene production from butadiene. This area includes butadiene storage,
        chlorination, Di-Chloro-Butene (DCB) treatment, isomerization and dehydrochlorination
        sections, as well as chloroprene neutralization. Chloroprene neutralization unit combines both
        acetylene and butadiene derived chloroprene for neutralization purposes, prior to it being
        sent across to the PCR rubber unit for further polymerization.
       This area also includes a nitric oxide preparation unit (from nitric acid), which is then fed to
        Area-12b (chloroprene distillation), as well as used internally to stabilized chloroprene
        monomer.
       Liquids and chlorinated hydrocarbon waste generated within this area of the chloroprene
        monomer unit are sent to Area 1-19 for disposal via incineration.
       Poly-Chloroprene Rubber (PCR) Unit:
       This is the same unit, as per Butadiene route.
       Area 1-21: Recovery of recycled chloroprene
       Area 1-22: CR polymerization and degassing.
       Area 1-23: Rubber finishing lines.


Condition of the Main Process Units – ISBL
Chlor-Alkali Unit
The condition of the existing chlor-alkali unit has been discussed in some detail above (please refer to
p.2-58)
In the event of chloroprene monomer production from butadiene, the key required chlor-alkali
product is chlorine gas rather than HCl. Critically, due to both high purity requirements for chlorine
gas that may be used within chloroprene production from butadiene, as well as the increased chlorine
throughputs required; the existing diaphragm electrolysis units are not well suited. Thus, we consider
that a new modular unit has to be installed instead.

Licensing for New Process Unit
Three processes are used commercially for the production of chlorine and caustic soda:
      The mercury cell process
      The diaphragm process
      The membrane process
All of the above processes consume large amounts of electrical power. The power demand per ton of
chlorine ranges from around 3 200 – 3 600 kW-hr for the mercury process to
2 800 – 3 100 kW-hr for the diaphragm process, to around 2 800 – 3 000 kW-h for a modern
membrane process.
Not least because of the higher power consumptions, the mercury cell and diaphragm processes are
now considered wholly obsolete for new construction, though existing plants with these processes
continue to operate. Both these types of obsolete plant are also now under severe environmental
pressure; mercury cells due to their mercury emissions and diaphragm cells since the diaphragm is
composed of asbestos and hence poses a hazard in fabrication, replacement and disposal.
For the last 20 years all new construction has been based on the membrane process. In the membrane
process the anode and cathode are separated by an ion exchange membrane. This membrane only
allows Na+ ions and a certain quantity of water to diffuse into the cathode chamber. The fresh brine
(NaCl) enters the anode compartment where chlorine gas (Cl2) is generated at the anodes. The brine
leaving the anode chamber is thus depleted, and caustic soda (NaOH) is removed from the cathode
chamber. Hydrogen gas is also evolved at the cathode.
Thus, the new chlorine production unit will be a membrane process. The technology can be licensed
from the following leading providers of membrane technology.
      Asahi Kasei
      Chlorine Engineers
      Ineos
      Uhde

Chloroprene Production Unit
Process Overview – Chloroprene Production from Butadiene
Nairit’s chloroprene production unit operated on butadiene feedstock is based on the BP/Distillers
original process, developed in the UK in 1971.
Start-up Date:                   1980
Design Capacity:                 75 kta (briefly reached in 1987)
Actual Capacity:                 Has not been run since 1995
Area 1-18 Chloroprene Production from Butadiene
The process is based on 3 key reaction stages:
       Butadiene Chlorination to di-chlorinated isomers
       Isomerisation of 1,4-di-chloro-2-butene to 3,4-di-chloro-1-butene
       Dehydrochlorination of 3,4- di-chloro-1-butene to chloroprene
All of the stationary equipment was manufactured in the USSR, whereas the rotating equipment and
pneumatic control system were supplied by firms from UK and Japan.
Chlorination
There are three chlorination reactors, each with an equivalent capacity of 25 kta of chloroprene
monomer. Butadiene from storage is first passed through a series of brine refrigerant chillers and
dryers, to achieve a water content of less than 10 ppm, before it is fed to the overhead condenser
system of the degassing column downstream of the chlorination reactors. The overhead product from
the degassing column contains mainly unreacted butadiene, HCl and other light end inerts. The mix of
this recovered butadiene stream and fresh feed is then compressed and preheated with steam, before
being fed to the chlorination reactors, of which Nairit have 2+1, due to a much large throughput of
the unit when originally operated. These contain an inlet mixer through which chlorine gas from the
chlor-alkali unit is mixed into the butadiene stream, always maintaining a large excess of butadiene to
limit the formation of super-chlorinated products (e.g. tetra-chloro-butane) and act as a heat carrier,
absorbing the heat from the exothermic reactions. The reactor is an empty shell, containing no
catalyst, where the following reactions take place at about 270°C and 1 atm:
       CH2=CH–CH=CH2               + Cl2    →       CH2Cl–CH=CH–CH2Cl
                  (butadiene)                       (1,4-dichloro-2-butene or 1,4-DCB)
    
       CH2=CH–CH=CH2               + Cl2 →          CH2Cl–CHCl–CH=CH2                      (butadiene)
                                    (3,4-dichloro-1-butene or 3,4-DCB)
    
       2CH2=CH–CH=CH2              + Cl2    →       2CHCl=CH–CH=CH2
                         (butadiene)                        (α-chloroprene or 1-chlorobutadiene)
                   
        2CH2=CH–CH=CH2              + Cl2    →       2CH2=CCl–CH=CH2
                  (butadiene)                       (β-chloroprene or 2-chlorobutadiene)

Other by-products of the reaction are tri-chloro-butanes, tetra-chloro-butanes and polymeric tars. The
reactor effluent is then quenched against cooled reactor effluent down to 100ºC, passed through a
water cooler to reduce the temperature down to 40ºC and fed to a check tank, from where both liquid
(primarily DCBs) and gaseous (mainly unreacted butadiene) phases are then separately fed to a
degassing column directly downstream. Nairit have two twin degasser trains. In the degassing column,
unreacted butadiene, HCl and inerts are separated from the reactor effluent, recovered in the
overhead condenser system, to be mixed with fresh butadiene feed and recycled back to the
chlorination reactor inlet.
In order to prevent a build-up of inerts, a purge stream is taken from the stream routed to the
chlorination reactors, cooled to -25ºC and routed to a butadiene recovery column, where the
butadiene in the purge is recovered in the counter-current wash with chilled circulating butadiene
(recirculated from the column’s bottom), and then a portion of the chilled degasser column bottom
product. Some caustic is added to capture any HCl present. The inerts exiting the column in the
overheads are then further scrubbed with water and vented to atmosphere. Butadiene captured in
the wash, is chilled and then split. A part of the stream is pumped back to the top of the column to
capture more butadiene in the incoming purge stream, while the rest is pumped back to the degassing
column.
The bottoms product from the degassing column is then water cooled and fed to a heavy ends column,
where higher chloro-butanes and polymeric tars are removed at the bottom of the column, whereas
di-chloro-butanes and chloro-butadienes (1,4-DCB; 3,4-DCB; α- and β-chloroprenes) are recovered in
the overhead condenser system, from where they are pumped to Isomerisation.
Isomerisation
Nairit have two twin isomerisation trains, each with an equivalent plant capacity of 50 kta of
chloroprene monomer. Di-chloro-butanes and chloro-butadienes from the heavy ends column in the
chlorination section are first introduced to 3,4-DCB extraction column, where 3,4-DCB and light ends
are separated from 1,4-DCB and recovered in the overhead condenser system. The bottom product is
1,4-DCB, which is partially reboiled, partially fed to an isomerisation reactor (using cuprous chloride
catalyst solution – 200 ppm CuCl), which is an empty shell. A small quantity of phenothiazine inhibitor
is added to prevent polymerisation, so that the following isomerisation reaction is favoured at about
115ºC and partial vacuum:
       CH2Cl–CH=CH–CH2Cl                →       CH2Cl–CHCl–CH=CH2
       (1,4-dichloro-2-butene or 1,4-DCB)       (3,4-dichloro-1-butene or 3,4-DCB)
The liquid effluent is then circulated through four dedicated thermo-syphons (set in parallel) to
vaporise the more volatile 3,4-DCB isomer, so that when the two phase flow is returned to the reactor,
3,4-DCB isomer product is taken as a gas product overhead and returned to 3,4-DCB extraction
column.
3,4-DCB and light ends recovered in the overhead condenser system are water cooled and condensed.
The remaining non-condensed gas is then further chilled against brine refrigerant and ejected to flare.
The liquid 3,4-DCB and light ends are then fed to a light ends column, where the light ends are
separated as an overhead product in both liquid and gas phases. The gas phase is then ejected to flare,
whereas the liquid phase is pumped to the liquid and chlorinated waste incinerator area 1-19 for
thermal destruction. 3,4-DCB is recovered as a bottoms product, from where it is dosed with
polimerisation inhibitor and pumped to intermediate storage before being fed to
dehydrochlorination.

Dehydrochlorination
3,4-DCB from intermediate storage is first used to wash outgoing off-gas from the chloroprene
distillation to recover any traces of chlorohydrocarbons and then fed to the dehydrochlorination CSTR
type reactor, to which fresh caustic, steam and polymerisation inhibitor are also added. The
chloroprene recycle stream’s liquid phase from downstream PCR rubber production unit is also routed
to this column so as to maximise the recovery of useful halide hydrocarbons from the PCR rubber
production unit. In the resultant alkali environment, 3,4-DCB is reacted at about 90ºC and 5 bara:
       CH2Cl–CHCl–CH=CH2       + NaOH           →       CH2=CCl–CH=CH2 + NaCl + H2O
       (3,4-DCB)                                                 (β-chloroprene)
       CH2Cl–CHCl–CH=CH2       + NaOH           →       CHCl=CH–CH=CH2 + NaCl + H2O
       (3,4-DCB)                                                 (α-chloroprene)


Most of the reaction occurs in the liquid phase, which is continuously taken off at the bottom of the
CSTR together with the formed brine and passed through a series of settlers to separate organic and
aqueous phases. The organic phase is then returned for further chloroprene distillation, whereas the
aqueous phase is then passed through a stripper column and sent to the OSBL wastewater facilities.
The overhead organics gas is fed to the bottom of the chloroprene stripper column.
The effluent gas phase from the CSTR is fed to the middle of the same chloroprene stripper column,
where the resulting distillation separates chloroprenes from the entrained aqueous phase. Crude β-
chloroprene is collected overhead and sent to a final chloroprene product distillation column to
remove the undesired α-chloroprene from β-chloroprene that is suitable for PCR rubber production.
The chloroprene recycle stream’s gas phase from the downstream PCR rubber production unit is also
routed to this column so as to prevent a build-up of α-chloroprene impurity in the PCR rubber
production unit.
β-chloroprene (99.5 wt.%) product is recovered overhead, condensed and sent to intermediate
storage before being used as feedstock for batch polymerisation within PCR production plant. The off-
gases are washed with incoming 3,4-DCB from intermediate storage to recover any trace 3,4-DCB and
are then sent to flare. The bottom product is α-chloroprene, which is recycled back to
dehydrochlorination reactor via the chloroprene stripper column.

General Condition of the Chloroprene Production Unit – Butadiene
The general condition of the equipment contained within Chloroprene Production from Butadiene
section of the unit appears to be generally in an adequate condition and of good integrity. However,
the plant has not been in operation since 1994 and therefore it is uncertain what actions or equipment
replacements might be needed as a result of the commissioning process.
Generally, the unit’s process equipment appeared to be corrosion free and well maintained, due to
what appears to be carefully mothballing of the unit and continuous repairs that have been done on
the unit’s process equipment over the recent years, as Nairit’s management have been trying to
restore this route for some time now. Without doubt, it is the best kept process unit onsite.
Our major concern with regards to the present condition of this process is two-fold:
       It has not been operated since 1994, so despite visual appearance and Nairit’s own testing of
        the equipment, there is a significant chance that a fraction of the process equipment and
        associated unit’s pipework will be found unfit for purpose and will have to be replaced at the
        last minute.
       There are insufficient HSE measures taken so far with regards to operation of this process unit:
            o   The current process design includes utilisation of existing atmospheric vents, which
                will lead to some unnecessary halo-hydrocarbon emissions into atmosphere, nor does
                it contain adequate sensors to measure these emissions.
            o   There are no warning signs with regards to level drops within the supporting building
                structure for the unit
            o   There are no gas detectors in the area and we did not see that operators are provided
                with adequate PPE.
            o   The acid resistant brick at the foundations of the support structure is in a bad
                condition and must be restored/replaced where necessary
            o   The fire-hose towers around the unit are severely corroded and must be replaced
            o   The gangways around the high rise columns appear to be of inadequate quality
                standard, appearing both brittle and slippery.
However, neither of these concerns is an overriding one. Commissioning risks can be offset with
adequate careful planning and provision of contingency budgets and schedules. HSE measures are not
a major investment, but will require a significant change in site culture. We have assumed that a new
dedicated DCS system will be installed to operate this unit, as suggested by Nairit’s management and
their cost estimate forwarded to us.
The upside of the current situation is that this unit was originally designed to produce 75 kta of
chloroprene monomer, therefore suggesting that there is a fair chance that future revamp
opportunities can be achieved at a minimised cost.

Area 1-18 Support Structure
At present the condition of the support structure is considered inadequate due to lack of HSE
measures observed while visiting this unit. The major concerns are as follows:
      The gangways around high rise columns appear to be of inadequate quality standard,
       appearing to be both brittle and slippery.
      There are no warning signs with regards to in-between level drops within the supporting
       building structure for the unit.
      The fire-hose towers around the unit are severely corroded and must be replaced.
Furthermore, there was evidence that some of the structure’s foundations were becoming dilapidated
and therefore must be repaired.
Utilities Supply
The following list of issues was noted with regards to the Chloroprene Production from Butadiene
Unit:
      Area 1-18:        Lack of firewater supply to the process
      Area 1-18:        The chemical sewer will have to be rechecked for integrity
      Area 1-19:        New Chlorinated and Liquids Waste Incinerator is required
      New CW supply is presumed

Unit Operability & Condition of the Process Instrumentation and Control
systems – Butadiene based Chloroprene Production
At present, the overall process unit control is manual, operated by field operators on a pneumatic
control system, whereby measurements are made by local instrumentation. However, the revamp
work cost estimate provided to us by Nairit management includes a suitable cost estimate for a new
DCS to be installed prior to unit restart. We consider this to be the correct approach.




                                                 102
Venting
A particular concern is the current presence of atmospheric vents within the design of this this unit,
which will lead to some chloroprene and related compounds being released to the atmosphere within
Yerevan city limits.
This is not the current world class practice and does not comply with best available technology
requirements in the West. We recommend that the design of the plant is reviewed to route these
vents to a suitable source of thermal destruction.

Polychloroprene Production Unit

Utility and Offsites (OSBL)
Utilities
For utilities, we expect the following process units will be required:
       Process & Instrument Air systems
       Demineralisation Water (DMW) plant
       Deaerator (DEA)
       New Auxiliary Steam Boiler Plant
       Liquid & Chlorinated Waste Incinerator
       Cooling Water Systems
       Nitrogen Supply
       Refrigeration Systems
The utilities required for each scenario will broadly be the same, albeit at different capacities, so the
condition of the existing units is reviewed jointly, with a special note if any of the scenarios does not
require it.
A brief overview of each of these process units is presented below.




                                                   103
Process & Instrumentation Air systems
The existing unit, located at the site location of the existing Air Separation Unit (ASU) will be made
redundant since a new ASU will be installed, as well as a new DCS and instrumentation. Thus, a whole
new system will be required for any of the considered scenarios.
It is our recommendation that it is installed at the main site rather than at the site of the ASU, so as to
avoid the need for interconnecting piping, associated pressure loss, as well as increased maintenance.

Demineralisation Water (DMW) plant
The current DMW plant / building is in an adequate condition, provided some civil works are
undertaken to ensure there no sudden “unmarked? drops in the floor and the plant is fitted with better
lighting.
However, it is insufficient to accommodate a new auxiliary steam boiler facility that will be required
to provide steam to the main process units. Also, the location of the unit, adjacent to butadiene
storage tanks is between 1 and 2 km away from the main process units, where the connecting
pipework has an excessive number of flanges.
Our recommendation is that a new DMW plant is purchased and installed near the auxiliary steam
boiler (largest DMW consumer), even perhaps in the same process building
Conversely, if no steam boiler installation is undertaken, and steam may be imported from a third
party, then a refit of the existing DMW plant is perhaps more cost effective.

Deaerators (DEA) plant
The current four DEA units are located adjacent to the existing DMW plant. Their condition also
appears to be adequate, provided some civil works are undertaken to ensure that floor panels and
stairs are made safe.
The main issues with its re-use are the same as those of the DMW plant:
       Its present capacity is not sufficient to meet the throughput requirements should a new boiler
        plant be required;
       The location of the unit, adjacent to butadiene storage tanks is between 1 and 2 km away
        from the main process units, where the connecting pipework has an excessive number of
        flanges.
Again, our recommendations are similarly split on whether a new auxiliary steam boiler facility is
installed.
If a new auxiliary steam boiler is installed, then it seems common sense to invest in some new DEA
units that can be housed within the same process building as the new auxiliary steam boilers and new
DMW plant.
Conversely, if no steam boiler installation is undertaken, then a refit of the existing DEA plant is
perhaps more cost effective.

New Auxiliary Steam Boiler Plant
In the past, the plant operation was highly dependent on the ability to import steam from a third party
in order to provide several key duties around the site such as re-boiling, process heating, etc. In the
past, the steam was imported from a CHP power plant located a few kilometres away. Since the site
has been shut for a few years now, the feasibility of this is now under question and would require
extensive refitting for the steam import pipeline, which we do not see as a cost effective solution.



                                                   104
One of the main concerns is that relying on steam import for the operation of the unit will result in
the plant’s ability to operated being highly dependent on the operations of the nearby power plant.
The aforementioned power plant configuration relies on combined cycle built around a natural gas
fired turbine, Alstom GT13E2. A typical outage rate for such natural gas fired turbines is typically
around 10% a year. Thus, if Nairit were to import steam from this facility, they will be left with no
steam at least 10% of the year, causing interruptions in Nairit’s production rates.
For this reason alone, we strongly recommend that Nairit’s reconstruction project includes a new
auxiliary steam boiler. In order to provide additional reliability, we would suggest that 2 x 50%
configuration is preferred to a single large boiler, as this would allow the site to remain operational
even if one of the boilers is undergoing maintenance.

Cooling Water Systems
At present, the site has a number of cooling water tower cells in various state of disrepair. The Nairit
site team has proposed to reutilize the concrete basins at two locations:
       First location is to be adjacent to the existing refrigeration unit 2-3 and unit 1-18, providing
        the bulk of its CW load to these two units.
       Second location is to be adjacent to the proposed location of the new refrigeration unit and
        the polychloroprene plant units 1-21, 1-22 and 1-23.
Both of the proposed locations previously housed CW towers.
The CW distribution is both over-ground and underground. Nairit claim that the underground
corridors are regularly checked and are expected to require little investment to bring them up to
operating standard. The condition of over-ground distribution systems also seems adequate with only
minor localised spend expected for any particular pipe replacement segments.
Thus, we agree with Nairit’s proposed plan for reconstruction of CW systems and propose to budget
accordingly.

Nitrogen Supply
The current nitrogen supply is provided from the Area 1-6 and is located at a separate site, connected
to the main site via an existing 3 km long underground pipeline. The unit consists of three separate
mini-ASUs (cryogenic Air Separation Units), producing high purity N2 with less than 10 ppm of oxygen.
It also contains 8 hours of gaseous nitrogen storage and its own cooling water system.
The unit is currently operational. It is expected that only 2 ASUs are required to meet both normal and
maximum demand, effectively allowing for a spare ASU. This allows for highly reliable operation.
Conversely, the ASUs are fairly old and look quite worn. This results in inefficient power consumption
(40-60% higher than a modern ASU); mainly due to the use of old reciprocal compressors and the
distance that nitrogen has to be piped to before it can be used on site.

Acetylene route scenarios – 12 and 24 kta
The new nitrogen supply will be provided as part of the by-product nitrogen utilisation from the new
Air Separation Unit (ASU).

Butadiene route scenarios – 12 and 24 kta
For this scenario, procurement of new ASU is expected to be prohibitively expensive, where only
nitrogen is required. In principle, the existing ASUs, worn as they are, are operational and there is no
reason to foresee reliability trouble, provided that a spare ASU unit is kept live. Thus, we recommend
that ASU reconstruction budget is limited to procurement of an extra ASU compressor and a full set
of spares, so as to enhance the reliability of the existing unit and improve its efficiency.

                                                  105
Refrigeration Systems
The current refrigeration facility is capable of 3 Mcal of cooling, which is sufficient for all scenarios.
The condition of that unit is largely adequate, although the condition and efficiency of the ammonia
compressors must be investigated further.

Offsites
For offsites, these are:
       Fresh Water Intake and Transfer (from Kapuyt Licht)
       Brine Wells & Transfer (from Abovyan)
       Effluent Treatment Plant
       Butadiene Storage Tank Farm
       Rail Terminal
       Warehousing
       Fire Fighting Systems
       Auxiliary workshops (mechanical maintenance shop, electric equipment and instrumentation
        repair shops)
       Security Systems
       Laboratories
       Common Site Infrastructure
The offsites required for each scenario will broadly be the same, albeit at different capacities, so the
condition of the existing units is reviewed jointly, with a special note if any of the scenarios does not
require it.
An overview of each of these process units is presented below.

Fresh Water Intake and Transfer (from Kapuyt Lich)
The existing water supply to the Nairit plant come from groundwater piped from a borehole 22km
away in Kapuyt Lich. Nairit would like to increase the water supply by commencing abstraction from
four additional existing wells which will require permits. Although the groundwater wells are owned
by Nairit, it does not have sole ownership of the water supply pipeline. At the moment only one of the
groundwater wells has a permit for abstraction (well No.5). It is believed that up to 400 parties may
have partial ownership of the pipeline and rights to use the water. Some of the pipeline passes
through private land and built up residential areas where access is difficult.
The availability of a secure and adequate water supply for the future Nairit operations is a CRitical
consideration to ensure the viability of the site.
Nairit are currently in discussions with the municipality to obtain sole ownership of this pipeline.
However, until this sole ownership exists there could be risks with water supply to the site, in the
event that more influential or demanding users come on board. Nairit provide water to some
commercial greenhouses that are located on the water pipeline. No other official water users
currently exist, due to lack of industry in the area.
Nairit have not undertaken or commissioned any assessment to determine the quantities of
groundwater available within the aquifer. However, Nairit believe there is sufficient available for the
operational requirements of the plant and any other third party users. In the event of there not being
sufficient groundwater resource, Nairit plan to utilise water from the lake. It should be noted that

                                                   106
water from the lake contains a significant covering of algae and sediments. The poor quality of the
lake water is one of the reasons for Nairit’s plans to utilise groundwater instead, which is understood
to be of a better quality making it more suitable for cooling water in the plant’s operational processes.
Once abstracted, the water will be pumped along the water pipeline to an intermediate storage area.
At the intermediate storage area there are four tanks of 5 000 m³ capacity each and a switching
station. The 20 000m³ storage capacity provides fourteen hours of plant operation. In the case of
emergency repair to the storage area or abstraction points, Nairit can utilise municipal water from the
adjacent intermediate storage area.
In all cases, Jacobs Consultancy recommend that the implications of the shared water supply pipeline
for the future operation of the plant are evaluated further and necessary actions are taken to ensure
that Nairit will have the right to control supply of water to the plant. The sustainability of obtaining a
long term water supply from the aquifer will also need to be confirmed, especially in light of the
proposal to significantly increase the abstraction rate.
No assessment of the quantities of groundwater available for abstraction has been undertaken. As
the plant demands are for a significant quantity, groundwater levels in the wells should be monitored,
both for the protection of water supply to the plant and for third parties i.e. nearby residential areas
and agricultural users. The sustainability of obtaining a long term water supply from the aquifer will
also need to be confirmed, especially in light of the proposal to significantly increase the abstraction
rate.
Abstraction should be monitored at the general outlet connecting all the boreholes and a study and
installation of piezometers (to measure ground water pressure changes) undertaken to assess water
usage and drawdown. This study should identify whether or not there is adequate groundwater
available to meet the plant’s demands for an appropriate timescale without impacts on water
resources for third party users.
Although the existing permits do not set an abstraction limit, one should be set that ensure sustainable
use of the groundwater supplies. To do this it is recommended that meters are installed at each of
the boreholes to measure abstraction and water levels. This will establish the demand requirements
from the plant and enable determination of an average abstraction rate for the existing operations.

Brine Wells and Transfer (from Abovyan)
Unit 1-4 a: Brine Production and Transfer
The brine supply for the production of chlorine at the Nairit plant comes from a solution cavity mining
facility located approximately 27 km from the site. The present condition of the brine holding tanks
and pumps is unsatisfactory, although the wells appear functional. For additional comments regarding
the present status of the brine wells, please refer to Section E. Likewise, it appears that the existing
brine pipeline has lost its integrity due to disuse over recent years. The existing pipeline is not fit for
repair due to land availability and dispute issues.
Thus, a new brine pipeline will be installed between the well and the production facility. The new
trajectory will be along the main roads and has been estimated at 27 km, although it is not clear
whether Nairit has the permission of the Government to lay the pipe for the proposed route.
The current Nairit design proposes that the pipeline is built out of carbon steel. Jacobs Consultancy
recommends that the new pipeline (if over-ground) is built out of FRP pipe, since this will increase the
useful life of the pipeline and minimise both operating expenses as well as spillages of brine.


Also, we note that the elevation difference at approximately 600 m is significant, forcing the design of
the pipe to be able to withstand transfer of brine at significant pressures prior to receipt on site.


                                                   107
Unit 1-4 b: Brine Storage
Brine supplied to site via the pipeline is received in 3 x 3,000 m3 open roofed tanks. This represents 12
days storage capacity. The condition of these tanks is deemed adequate.
Brine from these tanks is pumped across to the chlor-alkali unit.

Effluent Treatment Plant
The current Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) is located at two separate locations:
       The main ETP facility is located approximately one kilometre away from the main site
       2 x equalisation and 2 x settling tanks are located onsite, marked as units 206, 207 and 208,
        near the railroad tracks.
The original main ETP was designed to process effluents from a number of enterprises nearby — Nairit
included — and has been inherited by Nairit, as all other enterprises closed down in the 1990s. It is
clear that no investment has gone into these facilities, and as such the condition of the ETP facilities
is not fit for purpose.
The additional equalisation and settling tanks located on site were operated to remove the bulk of
latex entrained in the chemical sewer waters from units 1-21, 1-22 and 1-23 before discharge to main
ETP units. Again, it is clear that no investment has gone into these facilities, and as such the condition
of the ETP facilities is not fit for purpose.
The Nairit site team has previously indicated that it is allowed to discharge its chemical sewer waters
into the main municipal sewer, since:
       Flows from the site are a fraction of the sewer flows;
       The downstream municipal waste treatment plant can process their effluent.
Nevertheless, Jacobs Consultancy team does not consider this a viable strategy for future plant
operation, as it is both questionable on environmental grounds, as well as leaving the site
operations vulnerable to both the operation of the municipal waste treatment plant or a change in
Government permitting policies.
Thus, it is proposed that the majority of the main waste water treatment is replaced with a new plant
located on the main site (see Figure D- 7 for block diagram). Upon inspection of the plot plan, it
appears there are large areas available around the existing location of the onsite equalisation and
settling tanks. Given the existing connection from that location to the main discharge point, we
recommend that the new ETP is built at that location, making use, where possible, of the restored
equalisation and settling tanks that are already there.
An additional unit operation — TOC removal — will be added to the new ETP. It is acknowledged that
there may be problems with latex blockages if carbon filtration is used, but for now the TOC removal
plant has been estimated based on this basis. It will be necessary to further investigate technologies
for TOC removal (e.g. bio-treatment) at the next engineering stage. However, the inclusion of this
unit into the present cost estimate is not warranted at the present stage.

Butadiene Storage Tank Farm
This unit is applicable to butadiene scenario only.
The existing butadiene storage tank farm is located adjacent to the existing DMW / DEA plants,
approximately one kilometre away from the main ISBL units. Despite a major public road between the
main site and the location of the tank farm, the tank farm is suitably far away from this road not to
pose any danger. It is effectively shielded via blast walls from the existing rail unloading terminal, and
other nearby units belonging to Nairit.
The tank farm itself consists of 7 x butadiene and 1 x nitrogen storage tanks. The tank farm capacity is
sufficient for 21 days of process operation of the chloroprene monomer plant at 35 kta rates. In
addition to these, the tank farm has:
            Its own chiller unit, to refrigerate the nitrogen blanket overheads, so as to prevent/minimise
             butadiene losses to atmosphere via butadiene spheres breathing line.
            Its own water pumps used to pump water to the top of the butadiene spheres, so as to provide
             an external cooling jacket.
            A protective bund, to avoid release during accidental spillage.
The tank farm is in an adequate condition, with all 8 spheres tested as of 2012, and declared
operational. The Nairit site team has proposed to reroute the existing breathing line vent to the
scrubber #1113 within chloroprene production unit 1-18, so as to eliminate the atmospheric vent. We
find such a proposal acceptable.
With regards to further revamp of the unit, we consider that for operation at 25 kta, the overall
butadiene storage is required.
It should be noted that for compliance with EU regulations, any new butadiene tanks would have to
be located in a double bund, with external refrigeration, resulting in substantial capital investments.
The existing storage is compliant with these regulations, as such stipulation does not extend to
previously installed butadiene tanks.

                                                                              109
       Another observation is that the current water cooling system for butadiene tanks is water
        wasteful, but is perhaps the most cost-effective way, since the installation of new butadiene
        cooling water jackets will be onerous in investment costs.

Rail Terminal
This unit is applicable to butadiene scenario only.
At present, it is assumed that butadiene supply is most likely to be delivered to site via rail. However,
the existing rail terminal has not been used since 1990s and the terminal shows signs of corresponding
decay. As such, both rail tracks and unloading butadiene platform will have to be extensively
refurbished before the operations can resume. Likewise, we recommend that the unloading system is
fully refit and fitted with suitable pressure equalization systems.
Conversely, the site does possess a diesel engine which is in good working order, so minimal
maintenance will be required for that unit. Finally, the metering station, while rudimentary, is also
considered adequate.

Warehousing
The condition of the PCR product storage is deemed acceptable and we expect that only minor
investment for gas and temperature sensors will be required.

Fire Fighting Systems
The condition of both the fire water pond and underground water corridors is deemed adequate, with
minor investment required for corridor clean up prior to start-up. Conversely, a complete refit of all
fire water jockey pumps is required, as their current state is unacceptable.
Furthermore, the fire fighters’ quarters are presently located outside the site, across the main road.
We consider such arrangement sub-optimal from the point of view of response times. We recommend
that they are relocated onto the site, with a special building provided for them near the plant security
gates.

Mechanical Workshop
Nairit possesses an extensive mechanical workshop space with a large amount of personnel, which
has enabled it to continue to slowly rebuild some of its process units, while scrapping some of the
redundant equipment, by only using its in-house capabilities. We consider this workshop to be more
than adequate for day-to-day plant needs, with the exception that perhaps more modern machinery
will allow improved worker productivity.

Electrical (High and Low Voltage) Workshops
Nairit possesses an extensive low voltage electrical workshop space with a large amount of personnel,
which allows it to maintain and refurbish old electrical drives, which would otherwise have been
decommissioned decades ago. We consider this workshop to be more than adequate for day-to-day
plant needs, with the exception that perhaps more modern machinery will allow improved worker
productivity.

Instrumentation Workshop
Nairit possesses a large instrumentation workshop building with a large amount of personnel, which
has enabled it to continue operations despite lack of funds and new control equipment. We consider
this workshop to be more than adequate for day-to-day plant needs in terms of the area available.
However, as the new DCS is introduced to the plant operations, all of the instrumentation technicians
will have to be retrained in the maintenance skills needed for the new system.



                                                  110
Security Systems
At present, the security system of the plant is limited to occasional observational posts spread around
the periphery of the plant and the main security building next to the administration building. We find
such arrangements acceptable, but recommend that additional closed circuit television cameras
(CCTV) are installed around the periphery of the site for added security.

Laboratories
These are generally located in close proximity to the process units that they serve, due to lack of
automated logging equipment for measuring emissions and effluents. We found most of the labs to
be in a very tidy and neat condition, but bereft of modern equipment, which negatively affects the
productivity of the lab technicians. Our other concern is that these labs are located very close to their
assigned process units, well within the blast zone.
We recommend a relocation of the labs to one central location and a switch to automatic
instrumentation where possible, to minimise the workload on the lab. We recommend that labs
equipment is completely renewed.

General Comments on Roads and Common Site Infrastructure
The general condition of the roads on the Nairit site varies from adequate to unsatisfactory. Most of
the main roads and access roads to process units on the main site are paved, albeit with potholes
which must be remedied. There is a general question with regards to the large amount of vegetation
growing near process units and roads, which reduces operators’ ability to see from one unit to another
and thus spot potential hazards on the adjacent units.
The road connections to some of the utilities, such as the waste water treatment plant, are not paved,
and are in an unsatisfactory condition, as they will not be traversable in adverse weather conditions.
This should be remedied.
As a general comment, there is no clear signposting on the roads, relying on the personnel to naturally
know their way around the site. There are no clear signs as to where the evacuation areas are. These
are serious safety deficiencies and the site needs to undergo a significant generational shift in terms
of its safety culture, should the production be restarted.

Additional Options Considered
In addition to the existing facilities, regardless of the expansion scenario undertaken, additional new
facilities are considered in order to lower production costs of the chloroprene monomer. These are
briefly summarised below.

Production of chloroprene via Acetylene Route
Alternative Acetylene Production Technology
The existing Nairit site production technology is based on partial oxidation of methane to co-produce
acetylene and synthesis gas. This method results in fairly high consumptions of natural gas, especially
when considering Nairit past performance – circa 8 650 Nm³ of natural gas per tonne of acetylene
produced.
There is an alternative process, as employed by International Specialty Products, ISP, at their Marl
production site in Germany – plasma arc, also colloquially known as the ‘sun of Hüls’, owing the name
to the plasma current generated inside the unit. The Marl units are operated on LPG feedstock, but
can be operated on natural gas, which is actually a simpler feedstock. The main attraction of such
process is the lower natural gas consumption – circa 2 450 Nm³ of natural gas per tonne of acetylene
produced. Conversely, the unit requires much larger electric power consumption, to generate the

                                                  111
plasma arc current inside. Thus, given that we consider the existing acetylene production unit, as
well as the associated Air Separation Unit will need to be replaced for either of the considered
acetylene production scenarios, this technology allows for an arbitrage on the electric power /
natural gas price ratio.
The critical issues, as with the proposed new POx unit, is the access to technology, and ISP willingness
to license this process to Nairit. In principle, ISP are not in the chloroprene business, so there isn’t an
obvious reason for them to withhold the licensing from Nairit, provided Nairit agree not to enter any
business where ISP is a player, such as 1,4-butanediol.
The high level performance comparison of the process options per tonne of acetylene produced is
summarised over page.

Note 1: Inclusive of Air Separation Power Consumption, where a new POx unit also assumes a new ASU.

The plasma arc process also benefits from:
           No Air Separation Unit is required
           Plasma arc does not require additional sulphuric acid or any other significant chemical
            consumption.
           Much smaller acetylene extraction unit, as the volume of co-products is approximately 3 times
            less, which results in much smaller capital investment, utility and chemical consumptions
            required for that part of the plant.
           Final hydrogen product may be more easily utilised for further synthesis (e.g. ammonia
            production)




                                                         112
          Conversely, the plasma arc section itself will require a relatively higher capital investment than
           the partial oxidation of methane (POx). Overall, the capital costs will still be a little bit lower,
           due to smaller NMP section and lack of Air Separation Unit.

Syngas Utilisation Unit
Although, the options reviewed below are outside the current assessment scope, it is thought that
utilisation of syngas at chemicals rather than fuel value would result in substantial reductions in the
cost of production of acetylene and therefore the acetylene derived polychloroprene rubber (PCR).
In the past, this syngas was sent to the nearby power plant for use as fuel. This option is no longer
feasible, as that power plant has been renovated and the new facility does not allow for syngas import.
In all cases, utilisation of syngas at fuel value is sub-optimal and results in relatively high production
costs for acetylene when compared to chemical utilisation options. Conversely, such options would
require additional capital investment that may be hard to justify.
The past performance of the existing acetylene production unit resulted in some 9,680 Nm³ of syngas
co-produced per tonne of acetylene product. This is equivalent to ~8,400 Nm³ of syngas co-produced
per tonne of polychloroprene rubber (PCR). Thus, depending on the scenario chosen, there may be
either 101 or 202 million Nm³/annum of CO + H2 syngas available for by-product chemistry.
However, depending on the application, this by-product syngas requires further conditioning before
it can be reacted to produce value-added chemicals. In all cases, it must be further compressed to the
pressures required by the reaction conditions of the desired syngas synthesis step (methanol, STG13
or ammonia) and passed through a series of oxygen scavenger and olefin hydrogenation reactors to
remove traces of oxygen, ethylene and acetylene present before it can be fed to the synthesis unit
itself.
The specific requirements for each of the above options are further discussed below.

Methanol
If the syngas is to be used for methanol synthesis, then an additional syngas compressor is required
to compress the available syngas to pressures closer to 80 kg/cm². In between the compression stages,
the syngas should be passed through a trim CO2 removal unit, so as to bring the stoichiometry R14 ratio
of the feed syngas above 2.05.
The resulting gas is then fed to a classical methanol loop and the obtained crude methanol is then
distilled to a chemical grade specification.
The product yields, based on volumes of syngas available from the existing acetylene production unit,
are as follows:
          12 kta of PCR production results in ~44 kta of methanol
          24 kta of PCR production results in ~88 kta of methanol
These are relatively small volumes, which are unlikely to make investment in such an option attractive
due to poor economy of scale of the resulting syngas utilisation unit, as dictated by the need to install:
          A new syngas compressor + methanol synthesis loop circulator
          A new hydrogenation unit to remove trace O2, acetylene and ethylene
          A new trim CO2 removal unit
          A new methanol synthesis loop

     Syngas To Gasoline process – e.g. TIGAS from Haldor-Topsøe
14
     Stoichiometry Ratio required for feed gas to Methanol loop = (H 2 – CO2)/(CO+CO2)

                                                       113
       A new methanol distillation unit
       A new methanol storage and export infrastructure
The resulting scope will result in both a relatively large investment required, as well as relatively large
fixed costs required to maintain such unit in operation.

Syngas derived Gasoline, STG process
The desCRiption below is based on the relatively more proven Haldor-Topsøe process, although all of
the syngas to gasoline type processes have a relative weakness in that the catalyst-aided conversion
from syngas to a mixture of methanol and DME (first synthesis step) is relatively unproven at a large
scale.
The advantages of such a route are that, unlike methanol synthesis, the process may be operated at a
lower pressure of around 50 kg/cm² without such a drastic drop in reactor efficiency and the resulting
gasoline product may be realised locally. Thus, a syngas utilisation step based on a STG plant would
require an additional second reaction stage where the mixture of methanol and DME produced in the
initial reaction loop is then further dehydrated to gasoline using a proven MTG catalyst. The resulting
hydrocarbon mix is then fractionated to obtain a pool of gasoline and LPG products.
The resulting product yields, based on volumes of syngas available from the existing acetylene
production unit, are as follows:
       12 kta of PCR production results in ~19 kta of gasoline and 2.5 kta of LPG
       24 kta of PCR production results in ~38 kta of gasoline and 5 kta of LPG
Similar to methanol, the main barrier to investment is the relative lack of economy of scale, since the
following new units must be installed:
       A new syngas compressor + methanol/DME synthesis loop circulator
       A new hydrogenation unit to remove trace O2, acetylene and ethylene
       A new trim CO2 removal unit
       A new methanol/DME synthesis loop
       A new gasoline synthesis reaction section and associated catalyst regeneration system
       A new gasoline and LPG fractionation unit
       A new fuels storage and export infrastructure
The resulting scope will result in both a relatively large investment required, as well as relatively large
fixed costs required to maintain such unit in operation.

Ammonia
A potential advantage of the acetylene production unit at Nairit site is that as part of the oxygen
production (Air Separation Unit) for the natural gas pyrolysis, there are relatively large quantities of
high purity nitrogen by-product available, far in excess of the nitrogen required for purging of the
process pipework during start-up and shut-down periods or for providing blanketing to the storage
tanks.
Thus, if the ammonia production is to be entertained, the by-product syngas would need to be first
compressed to a pressure of around 40 kg/cm². It is then passed through O2, acetylene and ethylene
hydrogenation section and fed to a CO shift to maximise the hydrogen yield. The resulting shifted gas
is then passed through a CO2 removal unit to remove the CO2 present in the gas, mixed with high
purity nitrogen from the Air Separation Unit and fed to a trim methanation unit that converts the
remaining traces of CO2 and CO to methane, as these are ammonia catalyst poisons. The gas is then

                                                   114
compressed further to a pressure of 150-180 kg/cm² and fed to an ammonia synthesis loop. The
resulting ammonia is then refrigerated and sent for storage (refrigerated at -33°C).
The following ammonia production rates may be anticipated based on volumes of syngas available
from the existing acetylene production unit:
       12 kta of PCR production results in ~46.5 kta of ammonia product
       24 kta of PCR production results in ~93 kta of ammonia product
Similar to the other options, the main challenges to investment are the relative lack of economy of
scale, since the following new units must be installed:
       A new syngas compressor + ammonia synthesis loop circulator
       A new hydrogenation unit to remove trace O2, acetylene and ethylene
       A new CO2 removal unit
       A new trim methanation unit
       A new ammonia synthesis loop
       A new ammonia storage and export infrastructure, as well as associated refrigeration
        capacities.
The resulting scope will result in both a relatively large investment required, as well as relatively large
fixed costs required to maintain such unit in operation.

Alternative Scenario– 1,4 butanediol (BDO)
Although the present option is outside the current assessment scope, should chloroprene production
from acetylene be undertaken as the preferred production method, it is worth considering other
potential options that may alleviate the lack of economy of scale associated with acetylene production
at Nairit plant. Namely, there may be a case for a potential acetylene scale up and utilisation of excess
acetylene via additional process units that consume acetylene such as 1,4 – butanediol (and its
specialty derivatives). The former is still predominantly produced from acetylene both in the USA
(BASF and INVISTA) and Western Europe (BASF, ISP), as well as playing an important part in the Asian
Pacific capacity mix (mainly Chinese producers).
The feasibility of such an option is out of scope of the present report. The major barrier to such an
option is that the technology holders for acetylene conversion to BDO are the producers themselves
(BASF, ISP and INVISTA). Therefore, there is an open question as to whether they would agree to
license their knowhow to a direct competitor. However, should such a barrier be solvable (e.g. Chinese
license or long term offtake by one of the western producers), then the idea has some advantages
such that it drastically improves the economy of scale of key production units such as acetylene
production unit and its associated air separation unit. It allows for back-integration with resulting
syngas, since acetylene conversion to BDO requires formaldehyde, which in turn is produced from
methanol. Thus, some 62% of syngas co-produced with acetylene that is utilised for BDO may be back-
integrated via synthesis to methanol first and then oxidation to formaldehyde.
In all cases, such investment requires further consideration so as to resolve the product logistics,
technology access rights and raise the investment required to achieve a suitable economy of scale
between 100 to 200 kta of BDO, equivalent to 31 – 62 kta of acetylene.


The raw material consumption for production of 1 t of BDO from acetylene is as follows:
       0.31 tonnes of acetylene


                                                   115
       0.72 tonnes of formaldehyde
       0.05 tonnes of hydrogen
The net major utility consumptions are as follows:
       0.22 MWe of electric power
       10.5 tonnes of 11 kg/cm² steam for re-boiling duties
This option is not considered further within the scope of the present study, as it implies a completely
new business structure for Nairit operations and must be assessed on its own merits, so as to
establish whether the following issues can be feasibly resolved:
       Access to technology and know-how
       Competiveness of BDO produced in Armenia relative to major international players
       Volume of capital investments required
       Marketing strategy for the BDO exports
       Project execution plan for the erection of the new facilities
       The overall economics of such an option

Required Capital Investments
Basis and Assumptions
The capital cost estimates for the process areas of the plant were primarily developed by the unit
capacity factoring technique. This technique uses the cost of a unit for which the direct construction
costs are known from previous work. The known costs are multiplied by a factor developed from the
ratio of the new unit's capacity and the capacity of the unit for which costs are known. Capacity ratios
are adjusted by exponents chosen on the basis of the unit type to reflect the economy of scale usually
observed for larger plants. An adjustment is made for design differences, number of trains, location
and time frame. Price escalation due to time elapsed between the date of the reference quote and
the present day have been allowed for using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index.
This methodology is consistent with the American Association of Cost Engineers’ (AACE) Class 5 type
cost estimate. The typical accuracy of such a cost estimate is +50% / - 40%.
Plant cost inflation indices such as Nelson-Farrar Construction and Chemical Engineering Plant Cost
are used, together with our own experiences of project costs, to estimate how the reference project
CAPEX would change over time.
Adjusting the reference project CAPEX for all of these factors results in an “overnight? or
instantaneous replacement constructed cost for the project on a 1st quarter 2015 basis.
Escalation during development and execution of the project is included and has been set at 2.0% p.a.
for the duration of the overall period of reconstruction prior to restart, which is in line with our
assumption embedded in our price forecasts.
Worldwide procurement of equipment and materials for new process units has been assumed. The
restoration of existing process units (chloroprene monomer from butadiene and existing PCR rubber
production units) as well as some of the OSBL units has been assumed to be carried out in line with
Nairit’s own project execution strategy, which would see them take control of the construction
management using local construction sub-contractors, which we consider realistic.
The costs were developed on a US Gulf Coast basis and then converted to an Armenia location by the
application of an overall capital cost location factor. We have applied a location factor of 1.3 for this

                                                  116
purpose to reflect the fact that most equipment will need to be imported, and the installation costs
will be somewhat lower, owing to lower labour rates in Armenia (even at reduced productivity).
For obvious reasons, the actual cost of the project will be driven by the chosen contracting strategy.
This is outlined below separately for each of the considered scenarios.

Contracting Strategy
The contracting strategy for the present cases will be based on the full works being financed via
balance sheet, with no recourse to project financing, so as to reduce the cost of financing charges and
shorten the project execution period. Nairit will perform its own construction management, hiring
construction sub-contractors as necessary at its own risk.

       Restoration and inclusion of new DCS systems

Required Staffing Levels
At present, Nairit staff levels – at 478 – are not exceedingly over to those we would expect to see
should the plant restart operation under any of the considered scenarios. We have provided below
our own estimate of the level of staffing required to operate the site after the proposed revamp.
Please note these figures relate to mature plant operation, and during the initial year of operation
after revamp, the number of personnel might be higher, as the transition from the current staffing
levels takes place.

We consider that the installation of the new centralised DCS system and the subsequent automation
of Nairit site plant operations will greatly reduce the number of operators required to run the
associated process plants at Nairit site. At present, we have assumed that the plant can be operated
with a 4 shift split, which is typical for petrochemicals operation in Europe, but Nairit might want to
consider implementing its own internal procedure for this. In order to facilitate the relevant
discussions, we have compiled a relevant breakdown for the operators required to operate the
process units involved in PCR production from butadiene. This breakdown is provided below.

Introduction
In accordance with our technical assignment, Jacobs Consultancy visited the Nairit plant during the
last week of February 2015. The purpose of the site visit was to assess the present condition of the
assets of CJSC “Nairit Plant? and collect all the necessary information with regards to the examined
assets.
The present report contains our assessment of the financial viability of the potential restart of
chloroprene rubber production on Nairit site. Thus, it contains the following topics:
      Butadiene Market Overview
      Price Forecasts
      Project Cost Competiveness Analysis
      Project Financial Modelling Analysis
The above was considered with a view to restarting production under one of the three currently
considered production scenarios:
      12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
      24 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
      25 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via butadiene route




                                                129
Overall Summary
The overall summary is as follows:

Butadiene Market Overview
       Butadiene is widely traded on international markets
       Butadiene supply to Nairit plant is feasible, subject to transit being made available via Georgia
        (political and commercial risk)
       Unavailability of butadiene supply from Russia suggests that, in the event of Nairit operations
        being resumed, butadiene will most likely be sourced from Western Europe (Germany,
        Netherlands or Austria).
       Due to unavailability of the rail connection with either Russia or Turkey, butadiene will need
        to be shipped to a Georgian port, from where it may be transported by rail to the plant.
       At present, Georgian ports do not have suitable port terminal facilities for receipt of butadiene
        from tankers. Thus, two options are available:
         o   Low CAPEX, high OPEX. Rail cars may be ferried directly or small portable containerised
             tanks used for transfer of butadiene.
         o   Higher CAPEX, low OPEX. A receipt terminal to be built in a Georgian port (main
             investment will be a new butadiene storage tank farm, provided an adequate jetty is
             available)

Cost Competitiveness Analysis Results
       Production of PCR via the butadiene route represents the more cost efficient method, despite
        high costs of butadiene delivery (at least US$250/ton) due to high natural gas and electricity
        prices available to Nairit, which adversely affect acetylene route based process.
       Generally, Nairit will be a lagging cost producer, with both USA and Germany based producers
        being significantly more cost competitive, effectively shutting Nairit from US and Western
        Europe markets.
       Due to more favourable logistics costs, as well as generally lower cost of production and
        product delivery, Japanese producers are more competitive than Nairit in Asian, African and
        Latin American markets.
       Once effects of capital charge are considered, Nairit becomes a sole marginal cost producer,
        unable to compete even with Chinese plants. It is also worth considering that the latter have
        historically benefitted from Chinese government protection, resulting in high import tariffs
        being imposed on all other foreign producers seeking to export into Chinese market.
       Overall, butadiene-based production at Nairit suffers from a weak cost competitive position,
        requiring a number of favourable conditions such as:
         o   Low crude oil prices
         o   Allowed entry into Chinese markets
         o   Reduced project return expectations to mitigate the effect of the capital charge
         o   Reduced competitor operating rates
       In order for production via the acetylene route to be viable, a significant reduction in the price
        of natural gas and electricity tariffs is required.


                                                  130
Financial Modelling Analysis Results
     Under all of the considered scenarios, the project yields a negative project return.
     The 25 kta butadiene-based scenario results in the least negative results, followed by the 12
      kta acetylene-based scenario, which generates less absolute negative revenues than a larger
      24 kta acetylene-based scenario.
     For the acetylene-based cases, the option of using the ISP plasma arc process for acetylene
      generation yields the least negative results at current prices for natural gas and electricity.

Butadiene Market Overview
Introduction
Butadiene is a versatile raw material used in the production of a wide variety of synthetic rubbers and
polymer resins as well as a few chemical intermediates. When the word butadiene is used, most of
the time it refers to 1,3-butadiene with the chemical formula C4H6. Butadiene is a colourless, non-
corrosive liquefied gas with a mild aromatic or gasoline-like odour. Butadiene is soluble in alcohol and
ether, insoluble in water and polymerizes readily, particularly if oxygen is present. Butadiene is a
commodity product of the petrochemical industry which is both explosive and flammable because of
its low flash point.
In 1863, a French chemist isolated a previously unknown hydrocarbon from the pyrolysis of amyl
alcohol. This hydrocarbon was identified as butadiene in 1886, after Henry Edward Armstrong isolated
it from among the pyrolysis products of petroleum. In 1910, the Russian chemist Sergei Lebedev
polymerized butadiene, and obtained a material with rubber-like properties. This polymer was,
however, too soft to replace natural rubber in many roles, especially automobile tyres.
The butadiene industry originated in the years leading up to World War II. Many of the belligerent
nations realized that in the event of war, they could be cut off from rubber plantations controlled by
the British Empire, and sought to remove their dependence on natural rubber. In 1929, Eduard
Tschunker and Walter Bock, working for IG Farben in Germany, made a copolymer of styrene and
butadiene that could be used in automobile tires. Worldwide production quickly ensued, with
butadiene being produced from grain alcohol in the Soviet Union and the United States and from coal-
derived acetylene in Germany.
The pattern of commercial production of 1,3-butadiene parallels the overall development of the
petrochemical industry. The butadiene industry began on a commercial scale in the late 1930s, when
the U.S. government built several butadiene producing plants to supply the developing synthetic
rubber industry. The butadiene plants built by the government used catalytic dehydrogenation to
convert normal butane to butadiene. Production from this type of unit was the primary source of
butadiene in the US for many years. A very little butadiene was generated as a co-product by early US
ethylene plants as they were mainly based on ethane or propane feedstock. In fact, it was not until
the early 1980s that the quantity of butadiene produced from US ethylene plants as a co-product
exceeded that produced in dehydrogenation units. Worldwide dehydrogenation capacity had their
presence in Mexico, Argentina, Romania, Poland and China. All of these plants have been shut down
since the 1990’s except a few still operating in Russia.
At the current time, nearly all of the world's butadiene is produced by extracting the monomer from
crude C4. Crude C4, in turn, is produced from cracking heavy feedstock such as naphtha. Butadiene
production from ethylene plants is now becoming insufficient to adequately supply butadiene demand
in many areas of the world due to the trend of crackers shifting towards lighter feedstock and hence
is affecting the price economics of butadiene with a sharp increase seen recently. In light of this,
producers are once again considering building on-purpose dehydrogenation facilities. The growing
supply crunch of butadiene is likely to be met by on-purpose production.
In the US, crackers have switched to lighter natural gas-based feedstock because of the advent of shale
gas. This trend has reduced production of crude C4. The United States, a major butadiene importer,
already has a dehydrogenation plant which used to operate intermittently but has not run since late
2000 and is now planned to be restarted. A few other plants in China are set to start on-purpose
butadiene production through oxy-dehydrogenation process, which has not yet seen successful
commercialization anywhere in the world. Considering the current scenario, on-purpose technologies
will become important and will be economical under high price scenarios.

Butadiene Production Processes Overview
The major source of butadiene is as a by-product in the steam cracking of LPGs, naphtha and gas oil
to make ethylene and propylene. The butadiene is extracted from the C4 cracker stream using
extractive distillation. Almost all butadiene is produced as a by-product of the ethylene production
steam cracking process. In certain parts of the world (mainly in Central & Eastern Europe and North
America) there are still some production units based on on-purpose routes to butadiene (i.e.
Dehydrogenation technology), though not in operation. In the past, ethanol has also been used as a
feedstock for on-purpose butadiene.
Butadiene is commonly produced by four processes:

Steam CRacking: Extraction from C4 hydrocarbons
The steam CRacking process shown in Figure E-1 is the predominant method of butadiene production,
accounting for nearly 95% of the world’s butadiene supply. In the United States, Western Europe, and
Japan, butadiene is produced as a by-product of the steam cracking process used to produce ethylene
and other olefins. When mixed with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (often over
900°C), aliphatic hydrocarbons give up hydrogen to produce a complex mixture of unsaturated
hydrocarbons, including butadiene.

Since the boiling points of the various C4 components are close to each other, separation of butadiene
via simple distillation doesn’t currently suffice to adequately separate the components; therefore,
extractive distillation (ED) is used. ED is a vapour-liquid process operation that uses a third component,
or solvent, to effect a chemical separation. The extractive agent creates or enhances the volatility
difference between the components to be separated. The extractive agent and agent-induced less
volatile component flow to the bottom of the distillation column, where the extracted component is
recovered by a subsequent distillation. The non-extracted species are distilled to the top of the
extractive distillation tower.
Butadiene is typically isolated from the other four-carbon hydrocarbons produced in steam cracking
by extraction into a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile (‘ACN), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP),
furfural, or dimethylformamide (DMF), from which it is then stripped by distillation.
The first plants using furfural as solvent were built in the United States during World War II (the
process was developed by Phillips Petroleum). The method introduced by Shell in the early 1950s uses
acetonitrile as solvent. It was developed from a one-step procedure involving separate removal of
acetylene into a two-step process and is still applied today. Modern plants employ the BASF procedure
with N-methylpyrrolidone or the DMF method of Nippon Zeon.
The quantity of butadiene produced depends on the hydrocarbons used as feed. Light feeds, such as
ethane, give primarily ethylene when cracked, but heavier feeds like naphtha or virgin gas oil favour
the formation of heavier olefins, butadiene, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The pertinent yields from
various cracker feedstocks are shown in Table E-1. The data illustrate that ethane and propane
produce significantly less butadiene (and other C4 olefins) than butane, naphtha and gas oil.

Relatively few crackers in the world have all of this flexibility. While some cracker can feed any of these
feedstocks, it is much more common to build a cracker designed to operate with only one or two of
these feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, most of the crackers are built to feed naphtha and/or gas oil. In
the United States, many can feed only natural gas liquids (NGL’s - i.e. ethane, propane and normal
butane). Feedstock selection is a very important factor in establishing the quantity and quality of co-
product production for a given quantity of ethylene production. For the purposes of calculating
butadiene production, a factor is used relative to ethylene production. Olefins plants are generally
operated to meet ethylene demand; thus, co-products are produced as a function of the ethylene
rate. This is expected to remain the case for the foreseeable future and butadiene production will
always change with the needs of the ethylene market. Thus, by using a co-product to ethylene ratio,
the quantity of the co-product can be calculated.

On-Purpose Butadiene: Dehydrogenation of Butane & Butene
The other source of butadiene is dehydrogenation, often referred to as “on-purpose?. There are
actually two “on-purpose? systems that have been used to produce refined butadiene in various
countries around the world. Though producing butadiene from butane or butylenes is not a new
concept, one of the emerging trends in the global butadiene market is the renewed interest in on-
purpose production. In the last decade, the on-purpose share of global butadiene production has
been in the range of 3.2%.

Dehydrogenation of n-Butane
Butadiene can also be produced by the catalytic dehydrogenation of normal butane. The first such
post-war commercial plant, producing 65,000 tons per year of butadiene, began operations in 1957 in
Houston, Texas.
Prior to that, in the 1940s the US War Department constructed several much larger plants in Borger,
TX, Toledo, OH, and El Segundo, CA to produce synthetic rubber for the war effort as part of the United
States Synthetic Rubber Program.

In the former Soviet Union, before the political & economic transition at the start of the 1990s, there
was limited access to natural rubber and synthetic rubber feedstocks through imports, and so local
resources (NGL) had to be used. Dehydrogenation was the preferred technology to produce synthetic
rubber feedstock (butadiene & isoprene) from these streams.
In the FSU butadiene & isoprene are therefore manufactured by the dehydrogenation of paraffins.
The processes which have been used for these reactions are versions of the Catadiene (Lummus) and
the Yarsintez fluid bed process. The Catadiene process has been installed at Nizhnekamsk for the
production of butadiene.
The best known two-step dehydrogenation is the Houdry Catadiene process (Figure E-2), which has
been in operation on a commercial scale since 1943. In this adiabatic process, several packed-bed
reactors, arranged parallel to each other, are operated alternatingly. Aluminium oxide mixed with
approximately 20% chromium oxide is the catalyst. The n-Butane is subjected to dehydrogenation as
such or in a mixture of n-Butenes at 600-700oC and 10-25 kPa. The use of high temperature results in
by-products like C1-C3 hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and carbon deposits on the catalyst. After 5-15 min of
running time, the reactor is switched to regeneration. The heat generated by burning the coke residue
during the regeneration phase is stored in the catalyst and in the added inert material and is then
reused in the next reaction phase.
The concentration of butadiene at the outlet of the reactor is 15-18%. During the recovery process,
which includes absorption of the C3 & C4 hydrocarbons, compression, stripping, and separation from
unconverted n-butane and n-butenes, the concentration of butadiene is increased to 30-50%.
Approximately 550 t of butadiene is obtained from 1000 t of n-butane.
Phillips Petroleum has developed a two-step dehydrogenation process:

                                                   136
1)   n-Butane is catalytically dehydrogenated to butene at 600oC and 1 bar on CR2O3-Na2O-Al2O3.
2)   The n-butenes are separated by extractive distillation with auxiliaries such as acetone,
     acetonitrile, and furfural.
3)   The n-butenes are dehydrogenated to butadiene in an isothermal tubular reactor, heated with
     flue gas to 600Oc, at a pressure of 1 bar, with addition of superheated steam on a Fe2O3-K2O-Al2O3
     catalyst.
4)   Butadiene is recovered by extractive distillation with the above–mentioned auxiliaries and
     purified. The advantages of this method are the longer running time without catalyst
     regeneration and higher butadiene yields (65% based on butane).

Dehydrogenation of n-Butenes
n-Butenes are formed in the production of standard gasoline by catalytic cracking, in the production
of olefins by thermal cracking, and in the dehydrogenation of LPG. Normally, butenes are part of a C4
hydrocarbon mixture. The C4 paraffins can be separated from the C4 olefins by extractive distillation,
as routinely employed in the recovery of butadiene. The boiling points of isobutene and n-butene are
so close together that they can only be separated by special methods. The gas–phase BASF process
employs 40-45% H2SO4 to selectively convert iso-butene into tert-butanol. Today, separation is carried
out by conversion to methyl tert–butyl ether or to isobutene oligomers.

Oxidative Dehydrogenisation of n-Butenes
The conversion and the selectivity of the dehydrogenation of n-butenes to butadiene can be
significantly improved by removing the hydrogen from the equilibrium. The addition of oxygen causes
the oxidation of hydrogen to water:


                        2C4H8 + O2              2 C4H6 + 2 H2O


The exothermic oxidation of hydrogen partially covers the heat requirements of the endothermic
dehydrogenisation reaction and, in addition, the oxygen, together with steam added during the
reaction, leads to decreased catalyst coking. Especially productive methods are the Oxo-D process of
Petro-Tex and the O-X-D process of Phillips.

Figure E-3: Block Flow Diagram for an Oxo-D Process (On-Purpose) Plant




The Oxo-D process (Figure E-3) was first applied on a large scale in 1965. The advantages of this
method are the low consumption of steam and heating energy, high conversion and selectivity per
reactor cycle, longer life span of the catalyst, and no necessity for catalyst regeneration. Petro-Tex
achieved 65% conversion and a butadiene selectivity of 93% by using a molar steam/butene ratio of
12/1.
Phillips has operated a plant in Borger (Texas) since 1970 based on the O-X-D process, producing 125
kta of butadiene. Phillips also obtains a high conversion and an 88-92% selectivity of butadiene.

Butadiene from Ethanol
The original on-purpose processes for making butadiene from acetylene by the Aldol or Reppe routes
are no longer used on economic grounds. In other parts of the world, including South America, Eastern
Europe, China, and India, butadiene is also produced from ethanol as shown in the Figure E-4. While
not competitive with steam cracking for producing large volumes of butadiene, lower capital costs
make production from ethanol a viable option for smaller-capacity plants.
While this route to butadiene production is consider obsolete in most part of the world today, there
are two processes still in use. In the single-step process developed by Sergei Lebedev, ethanol is
converted to butadiene, hydrogen, and water at 400– 450 °C over any of a variety of metal oxide
catalysts.

This process was the basis for the Soviet Union's synthetic rubber industry during and after World War
II, and it remained in limited use in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe until the end of the 1970s.
At the same time this type of manufacture was cancelled in Brazil. Nowadays there is no industrial
production of butadiene from ethanol. Lately Laxness has announced a plan to produce butadiene
from ethanol. In the other two-step process, developed by the Russian chemist Ivan Ostromislensky,
ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde, which reacts with additional ethanol over a tantalum-promoted
porous silica catalyst at 325 - 350°C to yield butadiene.
This process was also used in the United States to produce government rubber during World War II,
though it was not preferred because it is less economical than the butane or butene routes for the
large volumes needed. It remains in use today in China and India.

Global Market Overview
The global butadiene industry has witnessed an average demand growth rate of 3.5% in the past 14
years and is estimated to have increased by 1.7% to 10.9 million tons in 2014. Strong upward
momentum seen in Asia and other developing countries improved the demand from the trough
witnessed in the year 2008-09. However, the demand did witness a dip in 2012 and 2013, with growth
rates contracting by 0.9% and 2.2% respectively, as the global economy turned sluggish and demand
declined from high growth developing countries like China and India. It must be noted that low
automobile market penetration and increasing disposable incomes in the developing regions are said
to be driving the demand for butadiene applications. Further demand gains are likely to be fuelled by
growth in key original equipment manufacturing (OEM) markets, particularly motor vehicles. In
addition, the worldwide motor vehicle demand will grow at a faster pace based on the emerging
strength of developing markets, supporting aftermarket demand.
Most butadiene is used in the production of polymers or chemical intermediates which go into the
production of polymers. These polymers are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial
products that provide tremendous benefit to society. These polymer products improve functionality
and performance of consumer products, improve safety and lower the cost of these products.
Butadiene-based products are important components of automobiles, construction materials,
appliance parts, computers and telecommunications equipment, clothing, protective clothing,
packaging and household articles.

Polybutadiene (PB) along with chloroprene rubber and nitrile rubber (represented as butadiene
rubber in the chart above) form the largest end use segment (31%) of butadiene. PB is used as a raw
material for tyres, an intermediate in production of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) resins and
as an impact modifier for plastics. ABS resins and adiponitrile are the second-largest use (about 23%
combined) of butadiene. However, the largest single end use for butadiene (about 30%) is in the
production of styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR). The primary use for SBR is in tyres and tyre products.
It is also used in adhesives and sealants, wire and cable coatings and rubber articles, such as shoe
soles.

Currently, crude butadiene is traded globally, with North America and North East Asia being significant
importers. Finished butadiene is traded globally, with Canada, Western Europe, Saudi Arabia and
Korea being the largest exporters. Mexico, the United States and China are the largest net importers.
Global demand for butadiene is expected to grow at about 3.5% per year, with demand growth for
synthetic rubber production expected to be around 2%. Demand growth for Northeast Asia (including
China) is expected to be higher than the global average; while growth in the United States and Western
Europe is expected to be below the global average. Butadiene demand by application is illustrated in
Figure E-5 & Table E-2. Butadiene rubber includes polychloroprene rubber, nitrile rubber and
polybutadiene rubber.
1,3-Butadiene is used principally as a monomer in the manufacture of a wide range of polymers and
copolymers. Polymerization of styrene and 1,3-butadiene yields styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), the
largest single use of butadiene; almost 80% of the styrene-butadiene rubber produced is used in tyres
and tyre products. Polymerization of 1,3-butadiene produces polybutadiene, almost all of which used
for car and bus tyres. Nitrile rubber is produced by copolymerizing 1,3-butadiene and acrylonitrile; it
is used in hoses, gaskets, seals, latexes, adhesives and footwear. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resins
are graft tert polymers of polybutadiene on a styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer; they are used in
automotive parts, pipes, appliances, business machines and telephones. Styrene-butadiene latexes
are suspensions of particles or globules of the elastomer in water and are used in paper coatings and
paints and as carpet backing.
Butadiene is also used extensively for various polymerizations for plastics manufacturing. Copolymers
with high proportions of styrene have found applications such as stiffening resins for rubber, in water-
based and other paints, and in high impact plastic. Butadiene also serves as a starting material for
nylon 66 (adiponitrile) and an ingredient in rocket fuel (butadiene-acrylonitrile polymer).

Elastomer Use
Over 70-72% of butadiene use is for rubber and latex (elastomers). The major solid rubbers produced
from butadiene include:
       Emulsion styrene butadiene rubber (ESBR)
       Solution SBR (SSBR)
       Polybutadiene rubber (PBR)


                                                  142
       Nitrile rubber (NBR)
       Chloroprene rubber (PCR)
Solid rubbers are used in the production of rubber goods, of which tyres is the dominant use. Other
uses include belting, hoses, etc.
ESBR was the first synthetic rubber produced. Production started in the Second World War when the
invasion of South East Asia by the Japanese cut off supplies of natural rubber to the Western powers.
However following the War, the supply of natural rubber was restored and the commercial interest in
synthetic rubbers waned. It was only later in the 1950s and 1960s with the spread of the automobile
that synthetic rubber production was again increased since the supply of natural rubber became
inadequate to satisfy demand alone.
The original hot emulsion process for ESBR was replaced by the cold emulsion process. More recently
the anionic solution process was developed. This yields rubbers with a narrower molecular weight
distribution, which are increasingly preferred.
Today both natural rubber and synthetic rubbers have an important role to play in the tyre industry.
With tyres becoming more technically defined and the specifications more demanding, the role played
by natural rubber and the various synthetic elastomers is differentiated.
ESBR remains today an important elastomer and is still widely used in the treads of tyres. However
the increasing sophistication of the tyre industry has led to the use of larger amounts of SSBR in tyre
treads and PBR in tyre walls over the last decade. Hence ESBR demand has declined as SSBR and PBR
demand increased.
There are two main variants of PBR. The major solid rubber produced is a high cis-1,4 polybutadiene
produced by Ziegler Natta polymerisation, originally using cobalt catalysts (today neodymium and
titanium based catalysts are more typically employed). This is a broad molecular weight distribution
polymer which is used by the tyre industry. A low cis, narrow molecular weight polymer is produced
by the anionic polymerisation of butadiene with butyl lithium. This product is not suitable for use in
tyres but is used as an impact modifier for polystyrene and accounts for around 20% of PBR demand.
Nitrile rubber and chloroprene rubber are characterised by higher levels of oil resistance compared
with SBR and PBR. These therefore tend to be used in seals, hoses, etc., where oil resistance is
required. Demand in these end uses is however in long term decline as other non-butadiene derived
elastomers are increasingly used (EPDM, butyl rubber, halogenated butyl rubber, silicone elastomers,
polyurethane elastomers, and other elastomers).
In addition to solid rubber there is production of rubber latex. The major categories of latex include:
       Styrene butadiene latex (SBL)
       Carboxylated styrene butadiene latex (XSBL)
       Nitrile latex (NBL)
       Others (small amounts of chloroprene latex etc.
SBL is used in two main applications as carpet underlay and in foam mattresses. Both of these end
uses are in long term decline.
Carboxylated latex is used mainly for the coating of paper for glossy magazines, advertising materials
etc. This is a growing end use. The other main uses for XSBL are in adhesives.
Nitrile latex is used in the production of hygiene products such as surgical gloves. The use of these has
increased with HIV, SARS and other health issues as well as the growth in DNA testing, security
screening etc.

In addition to the above, there is another segment of demand which is not a conventional elastomer.
This is the segment of thermoplastic elastomers. Thermoplastic elastomers are a category of materials
which can be melted and moulded like a thermoplastic and yet which are elastomeric in nature.
Furthermore in contrast to conventional elastomers they do not require to be vulcanised in order to
be elastomeric. Hence these are typically linear (or with limited branching) polymers (like
thermoplastics) rather than being highly cross-linked gels (the state of vulcanised rubber). In the case
of butadiene-based thermoplastic elastomers, they retain the high degree of un-saturation in the
polymer backbone which typifies other butadiene-based elastomers.
Butadiene-based thermoplastic elastomers are typically block copolymers combining in a single
macromolecule a block of butadiene rubber phase between two blocks of polystyrene; for this reason
they are often referred to as SBS thermoplastic elastomers.


                                                  144
SBS is produced by a variant of the solution SBR process whereby the reaction is commenced with
styrene only and then once all of the styrene has polymerised it is continued with butadiene. At this
point the reaction can either be continued with more styrene or the polymer chains can be coupled
to create the SBS block structure. Coupling agents include epoxidised polybutadiene, ethyl acetate or
vinyl acetate. SBS is by far the major component of the “others? sector shown in Figure E-5.
The major uses for SBS include lube additives, rubber and plastics uses, and as a bitumen additive.

Non-Elastomer Use
The main non-elastomer uses of butadiene are:
       ABS resins
       Adiponitrile
       Other end uses
ABS is the major engineering resin used in the world today, accounting for 40% of global engineering
resin demand. Engineering resins are characterised from commodity resins in being mainly used in
long life cycle goods such as electronic devices, cars, durable goods etc. rather than in packaging
materials and other disposable items.
The widespread use of ABS can be attributed to the fact that as it can be manufactured at much lower
cost than the higher performance engineering resins such as nylon, PMMA, polycarbonate etc. It
should be noted that ABS/PC blends (which contain around one third ABS and two thirds
polycarbonate) are of growing importance.
ABS is an important polymer in key markets such as electronic and electrical equipment (where
ABS/PC blends are increasingly widely used), house hold appliances and automotive applications (an
area of increasing demand as metal parts are replaced with plastic compounds).
There is also some relatively small commercial production of methyl methacrylate butadiene styrene
polymers (MBS). These resins are mostly used as impact modifiers in blends with other polymers.
The other main use for butadiene in non-elastomer use is in the production of adiponitrile by the
Invista process. Adiponitrile is a key raw material in the manufacture of nylon-6,6. The Invista process
is unique in using butadiene, with the alternative process starting from acrylonitrile.
Other chemical uses of butadiene cover a wide range of relatively small end uses and include
ethylidene norbornene, cyclo-octadiene, butanediol etc.
Butadiene demand is dominated by the production of rubber and latex elastomers, to serve its major
market, SBR and polybutadiene rubbers. This accounts for over 70% of global butadiene demand.
Thus, the dynamics of the tyre and automobile industries have a major impact on butadiene markets.
The severity of the financial crisis on the automotive industry, particularly in North America and
Western Europe caused a decline in global butadiene demand. Demand thereafter, improved in 2010-
11 on the back of the economic stimulus provided by Governments to sustain growth, but declined in
the subsequent years, as the Chinese economy grew sluggish and the Eurozone crisis deepened.
Within its non-elastomers use, ABS resin is the largest application amounting to 18% of total butadiene
demand. ABS resins were the fastest growing application with 7.0% p.a. demand growth rate in the
period from 2000 till 2014, despite the low demand growth experienced during 2008 and 2009 due to
the financial crisis. Other large volume applications of butadiene; styrene butadiene rubber and
styrene butadiene latex, have grown around 2.3% p.a. and 2.8% p.a. respectively.
In the long term forecast, the butadiene demand in the ABS application is forecast to stabilize at
around 6.0% p.a. as Asia drives demand growth. Demand in the other key applications like butadiene
rubber are likely to grow at a slower pace of 1.7% in the long term forecast, while demand for styrene


                                                  145
butadiene rubber and styrene butadiene latex are forecast to grow between 3.0-3.5% driven by the
growth in the Asian region. Butadiene application in adiponitrile, which is currently about 5.0% of the
global demand, is expected to grow at about 1.3% p.a. in the long term forecast.

Global Demand
Global butadiene demand was estimated to be 10.9 million tons in 2014. The global butadiene
averaged annual demand growth of 2.2% between 2000 and 2014. However, it should be noted that
the market actually grew by about 3.6% p.a. from 2000 till 2007, driven mainly by the Asian derivatives
demand, post which the economic meltdown affected the market with the demand declining by -2.8%
and -1.4% in 2008 and 2009 respectively. In 2010, the demand bounced back, growing by 7.4% while
in 2011 the demand grew by 4.6%. In 2012, demand contracted by 0.9% and further by 2.2% in 2013.
However, the demand grew by 1.7% in 2014.
Butadiene demand is dominated by the production of rubber and latex elastomers, to serve its major
market, SBR and polybutadiene rubbers. This accounts for over 70% of global butadiene demand.
Thus, the dynamics of the tyre and automobile industries have a major impact on butadiene markets.
Within its non-elastomers use, ABS resin is the largest application amounting to 18% of total butadiene
demand. ABS resins were the fastest growing application with 7.0% p.a. demand growth rate in the
period from 2000 till 2014, despite the low demand growth experienced during 2008 and 2009 due to
the financial crisis. Other large volume applications of butadiene; styrene butadiene rubber and
styrene butadiene latex, have grown around 2.3% p.a. and 2.8% p.a. respectively.

Figure E-8 gives the global butadiene demand by region. Share of Asia in the global butadiene demand
has grown from about 36% in 2000 to the current values of 54% in 2014, while North America’s share
has reduced from 29% in 2000 to about 16% in 2014. Given the strong demand growth in China and
other fast developing Asian economies, the regional demand for butadiene in Asia will outstrip the
total butadiene demand in the mature economies of West Europe and North America, with Asia’s
share moving fast from 36% of global demand in 2000 to around 60% in 2020 and about 75% in 2040.
The region of Eastern and Central Europe is likely to maintain its share in the global demand pie
between 6-7% over the long term forecast till 2040.

Figure E-9 presents an overview of market demand in the major world regions for butadiene in 2000.
Historically, demand growth has been dominated by Asia in volume terms, which has seen an average
growth in demand of 7% per annum in the period 2000 to 2007, equivalent to an increase in
consumption of around 1700 KTA over the period. Butadiene markets slowed down during recession
in Asia by growing at a rate of 5%. In 2010 and 2011, the Asian market showed reasonably strong
recovery 10.5% and 5.3% respectively. However, with the Chinese economy slowing down in 2012 and
2013, the demand contracted in Asia, by 0.6% and 3.6% respectively. In 2014, the Asian demand for
butadiene grew by 2.8%. Growth in the developed markets of Western Europe was much slower as
the demand volume increased by only about 430 KTA in total during the same 2000 to 2007 period
while North America witnessed a decline in demand by 240 KTA between 2000 and 2007. The
economic downturn affected the demand in developed regions with Western European demand
declining by -6.2% and -6.9% in 2008 and 2009 respectively; while North American demand declined
more drastically by -17.6% and -5.3% in 2008 and 2009 respectively. The North American market
recovered in 2010 and 2011 by 4.4% and 4.3% respectively. In 2012, as the global economy declined
again, the demand in North America, contracted by 7.5%. In 2013 the demand recovered by 4.0%, but
again declined in 2014 by 2.2%. In Western Europe, the demand continued to decline by 2.5% in 2010
and in 2011 demand recovered and improved by 2.3%. The growth was marginal at 0.3% in 2012,
while the market contracted again in 2013, by 1.9%. In 2014, the Western European market grew by
3.4%.The Eastern European region witnessed an average increment in butadiene demand of 6.9%
between 2000 and 2007 while in 2008 and 2009 the economic downturn resulted in lowering of
demand by 11.8% and 14.3% respectively. In 2010, the Eastern European market witnessed strong
recovery with demand growing by about 19.9%, while 2011 saw the Eastern European market grow
by 9.4%. In 2013 the demand declined marginally by 0.6% while the demand improved in 2014 by

period 2000 to 2014 was 3.5% and -3.3% respectively.

Figure E-10 shows that global butadiene demand is forecast to grow at approximately 3.5% per year
through to 2040. Asia is likely to be the highest growth region in the forecasted years with China being
the strongest demand market. Asia’s strong performance has been due to an increased production of
finished goods in electronics, automobile and tyre sectors, which is likely to be the case in the future
as well, with demand growth pegged at 4.8% in the long-term forecast till 2040.
Historically (until 2007), Asia was an exporter of butadiene, however Asia is likely to convert into a
large importer in the long term forecast. Although global capacity additions between 2014 and 2020
will be primarily in Asia, with approximately 1100 kT worth of butadiene capacity coming on stream
by 2020, demand is nevertheless expected to grow at an even faster rate resulting in Asia converting
from an exporter to an importer. Additions to butadiene capacity in China alone will account for over
24% of the global total, followed by India and some announcements in Taiwan.
Demand in the North American butadiene market is projected to increase marginally by 0.1% per year
during the 2014 to 2040 period. This represents an increment of nearly 50 KTA over the same period.
The North American market has historically been an importer of butadiene. On one hand, the region
has been experiencing a decline in SBR consumption due to decline in passenger car production as
well as imported vehicle tyres. Conversely, the advent of shale revolution has increased availability
and use of lighter feedstock for steam cracking, principally ethane, resulting in lower butadiene
production as a share of the average North American steam cracker yield. Going forward, with
relatively stagnant demand, and projected start-up of on-purpose butadiene plants, seeking to utilise
stranded C4s from the shale gas boom, we expect that in the long term the North America region will
convert to a net exporter.
Western European demand is predicted to grow at about 0.6% p.a. in the long-term forecast until
2040, driven mainly by ABS resins, adiponitrile and butadiene rubber products. Historically the region
has been a net exporter of butadiene, and the situation is likely to continue in the future as well, as
demand stagnates. Despite the fact that supply of butadiene in the region is likely to reduce as
ethylene production stagnates with capacities coming up in the Middle East and Asia at competitive
levels affecting the overall butadiene production, the region will continue to export small quantities
of butadiene owing to lowered demand.
The Central and Eastern European demand growth for butadiene is likely to be about 3.0% p.a. in the
long-term forecast until 2040 as tyre production moves from Western Europe to Central and Eastern
Europe. While historically the region has been a net exporter of butadiene, albeit small volumes, post
2011 it is likely to turn into a net importer due to tyre industry movement into the region. In the long
term, it remains as a net exporter of butadiene.

Global Supply
Prime drivers for chemical production are ethylene and propylene. Historically, businesses were built
around the low valued by-products of ethylene production. By-product streams are capturing more
value now, but strategic interest remains low. Figure E-11 shows ethylene and butadiene global supply
comparison.

The past 14 years have witnessed ethylene capacity growing at an average rate of nearly 3% and
operating at an average rate of 86%. Most of the new ethylene capacities have come up in Asia and
Middle East. North America, Western Europe, and Japan expect no growth in ethylene capacity.
However, most of the ethylene supply has shifted from heavier to lighter feedstock resulting in
reduced butadiene production. In US, shale gas driven shift to lighter cracker feeds is also likely to
influence the C4 and elastomers business. This reduced supply trend and increased demand from the
global automotive sector and other applications mainly from Asia region led to a sharp increase in
global butadiene prices in 2012. The prices however declined subsequently as new capacities coming
on-stream eased up the supply issues and demand stagnated as seen in Figure E-12.

Considering the present opportunity in C4 and elastomers, major players are opting for butadiene
production through vintage and newly developed licensing technology. The main issue to be
addressed is the high capital cost for the dehydrogenation of butane or butene and the separation of
butadiene. There are clearly opportunities to lower this cost by finding alternative routes, possibly by
re-engineering of older and largely abandoned processes, which use ethanol or acetylene as the
starting material.
Global butadiene production capacity in 2014 stood at 14.8 million tons from 9.4 million tons in 2000.
Nearly 33% of this capacity is located in North America and Western Europe. Asia has the largest single
regional share with nearly 54% of global capacity located in the region. Since the year 2000, around
5.4 million tons of new capacity has been added globally, largely in Asia, which witnessed additions of
4.6 million tons.

On a global scale, an average additional 390 kta of new capacity has been installed per annum in the
period between 2000 and 2014 representing a growth rate of over 3.2% p.a. Of these additions, about
84% of increments were in Asia, as the installed capacity base grew by over 6.5% every year during
the same period. More than a half of the capacity increases in Asia were in China.
North America’s butadiene supply position has been eroding over the past several years. Production
capacity grew by over 572 kta from 2000 to 2005, post that there were significant closures in capacities
that resulted in overall capacity increment of about 100 kta from 2000 to 2014. Closures of steam
crackers and the shift towards lighter feedstocks has demoted the US butadiene supply outlook and
resulted in a net importer position. A new 270 kta on-purpose butadiene production facility by TPC is
likely to come up in the region in 2017.

During 2009 crisis, Europe witnessed closure and consolidation in the region. Between 2000 and 2007,
Western Europe saw a decline in butadiene capacity of ~145 KT with no significant addition. However
new capacities have recently been announced in the region, including BASF’s 155 kta facility at
Antwerp, Evonik’s 100 kta facility at Antwerp and OMV’s 80 kta facility at Burghausen, Germany, all
expected to start in 2015. Western Europe’s global capacity share has been eroded from 26% in 2000
to 17% in 2014. Despite the new capacity additions, the overall percentage share of Western Europe
in global capacity will remain around 16 to 17% as more capacities come up in Asia and Middle East.
Central & Eastern Europe region witnessed an increase of 370 Kt of butadiene capacity between 2000
and 2014. Regional capacity growth consisted mainly of the re-start of previously idled capacity or
debottlenecks of existing extraction units. Efforts to consolidate and modernize the existing butadiene
and synthetic rubber capacity are advancing but at a slow pace in the region. MOL has announced a
130 kta butadiene facility in Hungary, which is likely to start up in 2016.




                                                                                 153
Within the same period, Middle East & Africa region has also seen a significant C4 capacity addition of
~245 Kt. The predominance of ethane and gas cracking that generates limited amounts of crude C4
by-product, combined with high shipping cost for butadiene and obstacles to investment in derivative
capacities, have been limiting the pace of capacity expansion in the region.
The prevalence of naphtha cracking in Northeast Asia is reflected in the comparatively high B/E ratio
averaging 15% for the last ten years. The start-up of several Chinese extraction units since 2010 has
caused a step change in available butadiene capacity and is keeping regional operating rates at low
levels in the past few years. New entrants in the Indian subcontinent are set to enter into the
petrochemical market with significant C4 extraction capacity. Emerging hub for most of the original
equipment manufacturer (OEMs), the Indian subcontinent has potency to support these butadiene
capacities.

Industry Structure
The increasing shale gas production has reduced the cost of US ethylene, but has tightened supplies
of C3 and C4 olefins. One of the emerging trends in the global butadiene markets is the renewed
interest in on-purpose production. To gain the opportunity, industry players are set for the resumption
of vintage plants giving a new paradigm to the petrochemical industry.

The main butadiene producers by their global share of production in 2014 are shown in the figure
above. Worldwide nearly 80 butadiene producers exist based on their respective shareholding
patterns. The top five producers (Sinopec, Shell, TPC Group, LyondellBasell and CNPC), accounted for
about 31% of global butadiene capacity in 2014. China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), leads the
world’s butadiene market, the sole initiator of China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, is a state -
authorised investment vehicle in oil and petrochemical business integrating upstream and
downstream assets. Sinopec caters mainly for the Chinese butadiene market, the most favoured
market globally. Following Sinopec, Shell ranks second and has a major presence in South East Asia.
TPC group ranks 3rd, predominantly leads the US market, which is also the world’s largest net importer
of butadiene.

Table E-3 gives a listing of various industry structure metrics for the butadiene industry. The
concentration ratio is the proportion of the total industry production capacity owned by the eleven
largest firms. It is therefore a straightforward measurement of the degree of consolidation. A
concentration ratio of 48% is indicative of a low concentration market with a reasonable degree of
competition.
The Herfindahl Index (HI) is a measure of the degree of consolidation and the amount of competition
in an industry. It is equal to the sum of the squares of the market shares of each firm. The HI can range
from 0 to 1 moving from a large number amount of small firms to a single monopolistic producer
respectively. HI values between 0.100 and 0.180 are generally considered to indicate a ‘moderately
concentrated’ market and above 0.180 to be a ‘concentrated’ market. The benefit of the HI over the
concentration ratio is that it gives more weight to larger firms.

The Herfindahl Index (HI) index for the butadiene industry is 0.027 indicating that the degree of
concentration in the market is very low. While the product cannot be stated as highly commoditised,
no single producer has a degree of control over the market price. This does also indicate that barriers
to market entry are not very high.
Table E-4 gives the market shares of the top seven producers in the butadiene industry globally for
2014. The capacities stated include the individual capacities of the producer as well as any capacity,
which they have in joint venture with other companies or with subsidiaries.

As shown in the above Table E-4, globally no butadiene producers have more than 10% market share
in the industry except Sinopec. Table E-5 shows the projected increase in regional manufacturing
production capacity up to 2019, based on the new projects being planned and under implementation.
From 2014 to 2019, around 3.11 million tons of new capacity will be added, mainly in the Asia region,
and China in particular. Some marginal capacity increments are likely to occur in Latin America,
Western Europe and North America as well as Central & Eastern Europe. Capacity additions are also

likely in Middle East as project developers are increasingly considering heavier steam cracker feed
slates, which give rise to butadiene in economically recoverable amounts.
Asia continues to undergo major expansions and is expected to achieve a total installed capacity of
over 9 million tons by 2019. About half of these new plants will be in China, providing feedstock to the
SBR plants as significant new automotive tyre projects are being planned in the country. The rest of
the new capacity is likely to be installed in other developing Asian countries such as India, Thailand,
Taiwan, and Singapore.

The US crackers are of vital importance as it has a predominantly mixed feedstock slate for ethylene
production. Given the recent availability of NGLs and ethane in the region, the next effect on B/E ratio
is likely to be a further reduction. The B/E ratio for the region has gradually lowered from 7.5 in 2000
to almost 4.9 in 2014.
In case of Western Europe, the B/E ratio is much higher as most crackers are naphtha feedstock based.
Historically the B/E ratio has averaged about 10.2 since 2000. Similarly for Central & Eastern Europe
where most crackers are naphtha based, the B/E ratio has averaged about 11.8 in the past 14 years.
In Asia, the B/E ratio for the naphtha crackers in the region is estimated to have averaged to around
12.5 in the period between 2000 and 2014. Currently about 300 kta capacity of on purpose plants are
in operation globally, all based in China. By 2020, this is expected to rise to 890 kta, with capacities
expected to come on-stream in China and USA.

Butadiene Supply/Demand Balance
Global Outlook
Global butadiene demand was around 10.9 million tons in 2014. This is anticipated to rise to around
13.3 million tons by 2020 and to 27.0 million tons by 2040, representing a long-term growth rate of
about 3.5% (Figure E-19). It is anticipated that there will be 14.2 million tons of potential production
capacity by 2040, assuming that operating rates will be maintained in the mid-80% range. Production
is anticipated to move from North America and Western Europe to the Asian, Central & Eastern Europe
and Middle East regions. But due to technology advancement, it is expected that on-purpose
butadiene capacity is likely to come in North America, China and South East Asia.

The global operating rate for butadiene capacity is estimated at 73.8% in 2014 due to lighter cracker
feedstock slates being used globally especially in North America reducing butadiene production from
some existing cracker complexes.
On a regional level while operating rates in North America continue to decline as feed stocks move to
lighter slates and development of shale gas in the future, in regions like Asia, Western Europe and
Eastern Europe the operating rates are likely to be maintained at mid-80s to low 90s in the long term
forecast till 2040 as these regions are likely to continue the use of naphtha as a predominant
feedstock. However, it is likely that some feedstock substitution will occur, with a consequent fall in
B/E ratio.

Eastern Europe/FSU
Eastern Europe/FSU’s average annual demand growth rate for the period 2000 to 2014 was 4.4% p.a.
driven mainly by styrene butadiene rubber and polybutadiene demand. The period between 2000
and 2007 saw the market grow by 6.9% on an annual average. However the market was affected by
the economic downturn in 2008, with demand declining by 11.8% in 2008 and about 14.3% in 2009.
Following the global trend, the demand recovered strongly at a higher rate of 19.9% in 2010 and by a
rate of 9.4% in 2011 as the demand from the automotive industry increased the demand for SBR. In
2012, the demand further increased by 16.5% driven by demand from SBR, while in 2013, the demand
witnessed a contraction of 0.6%, as demand lowered from the automotive segment. In 2014, the
market grew modestly by 1.7% over the previous year’s demand. In the long term forecast, the
demand in Eastern Europe/FSU is likely to grow by about 3.0% till 2040 driven mainly by butadiene
rubber and SBR demand as more automotive companies shift their focus from Western Europe to
Eastern Europe/FSU as a manufacturing base.

The utilisation rates in 2014 were about 74% which are likely to be maintained in the mid to high 70s
levels till 2019. Nearly 130 kta of new capacity is likely to come on-stream by 2019, via a new plant in
Hungary. Another speculative capacity addition may occur in Poland (bio based butadiene), whereas
the three Russian projects (all via by-product extraction) appear delayed to at least 2020 and beyond
based on their current progress. Rates are likely to be maintained in the higher 70s till 2028 and
expected to reach the higher 80s by the end of the forecast period till 2040.
MOL (through its subsidiary TVK) is currently progressing with construction of a 130 kta butadiene
extraction plant in Hungary. This plant is expected to come on stream in the second half of 2015, but
at least half of the resultant butadiene is ear-marked for a future adjacent SBR plant project that is
also in construction phase and is expected to come on-stream in 2017. Other potential new capacities
will come from the three 200 kta each Russian projects. These are SIBUR’s ZapSibNeftekhim at Tobolsk
(West Siberia), CJSC Vostochnaya Neftechimicheskaya (VNHK, part of Rosneft) in the Russian Far East

                                                  159
(Primorsky Oblast) and NKNK’s new unit of same capacity at Tatarstan (Volga Region). All three
projects rely on the larger world class steam CRacker projects to be realised, which are not expected
on-stream before 2020, with SIBUR being the only entity that has pronounced on the likely on-stream
date of 2020. In addition, Synthos / Global Bioenergies JV is also developing a bio-based butadiene
plant in Poland, but the project is yet to reach financial close, so its on-stream date is uncertain.

The region is anticipated to become a net exporter post 2016 when the new Hungary plant comes
online, ahead of its sister SBR project. Another driver will be increased butadiene demand from nearby
countries of Western Europe, where production is likely to gradually reduce, as WE cracker capacities
are likely to stagnate with less butadiene co-produced per tonne of ethylene, due to increasing usage
of lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks for the crackers.

Western Europe
Western Europe’s average annual demand growth rate for the period 2000 to 2014 was 0.77% p.a. It
is evident that the decline in demand post the global financial crisis has affected the aggregate growth
rate in the region. Prior to the economic downturn, between 2000 and 2007, the demand for
butadiene grew by nearly 3.4% on average, driven by ABS resins and adiponitrile demand. However,
in 2008 following the economic downturn, butadiene demand declined as derivatives used in the
automotive industry and construction industry bore the brunt of the downturn. In 2008 and 2009, the
demand declined by 6.2% and 6.9% respectively and it further declined by 2.5% in 2010, while in 2011
market recovered by 2.3%. In 2012, the market grew modestly by 0.3% while contracted again by 1.9%
in 2013. The demand grew by 3.4% in 2014 and is expected to grow by 0.67% CAGR till the long term
forecast till 2040.
Utilisation rates of 80% in 2014 are expected to lower in the short term forecast as B/E ratio is likely
to drop as the region is likely to import cheaper and lighter feedstock from US. New capacities in the
range of 220 kta are likely to come up in the region by 2016. On an average, till 2040, utilisation rates
are likely to be maintained in the mid to higher 70s. There is also a possibility of shale gas coming into
the picture in the next decade. If shale gas production starts in Western Europe, butadiene production
is likely to reduce.

Asia
In 2014, Asian demand was about 5.9 Million tons. It contributes about 54% of the global demand.
The Asian demand has been growing strongly in the historical years, even showing double digit growth
rates in a few years. The demand for butadiene was not very evidently affected during the economic
downturn, as the demand grew by 6.8% in 2008 and 4.9% in 2009. The stimulus provided by the
Chinese Government as well as higher demand from India resulted in the demand growth rates
growing by a further 10.5% in 2010 and 5.3% in 2011. However in 2012 as the Chinese economy grew
sluggish and the overall global macroeconomic scenario turned bleak, the demand in the region
contracted by 0.6% and a further 3.6% in 2013. Demand recovered by 2.8% in 2014. In the long-term
forecast, the demand growth for butadiene in Asia is estimated at nearly 4.8% driven by ABS resins
and styrene butadiene rubber as most automotive and other downstream derivative companies look
to set up shop in Asia. The expected future capacity additions, largely in China and India, will not be
adequate to meet the expected Asian demand growth. This will lead to the region becoming a net
importer of butadiene. North East Asia, in particular China, will drive this demand over the 2014 to
2040 period. The Indian subcontinent is predicted to have the highest demand growth rate of 4.7%
per year, within the region, over the same period. This is possibly due to the region having a much
lower demand base; in 2014 the demand from the Indian subcontinent accounted for 2.0% of the total
Asian demand. Investment in cracker complexes in India that will use a heavy feedstock slate is

anticipated to allow butadiene production volumes to increase. India is expected to become the major
exporter in Asia.
Utilisation rates declined to mid-70s in the past few years from the highs of mid 90s witnessed at the
start of the decade as new capacities came on-stream. In the short term forecast with the start-up of
new capacities, including a few on-purpose plants, utilisation rates will remain in the mid-70s. In the
long term forecast by 2040, these are expected to rise to mid to higher 80s.
As per our estimates a total of 300 kta of on-purpose capacity is currently operating in China, mainly
in the Shandong region. It is anticipated that this capacity will rise to 620 kta in 2015 and will be a total
of 890 kta by the end of this decade. Asahi Kasei is developing BB Flex technology, which will produce
butadiene from butene. It is expected that they will come up with 50 KTA butadiene plant starting by
end 2015, which will be further expanded depending on market conditions. Demand for automobiles
is increasing in the region due to growing population base and increasing earning power.

In Asia, demand for butadiene from ABS resins inCReased by a CAGR of 8.3% from 2000 to 2014 In
2014, the demand from ABS resins was about 28% of the total demand in Asia, which is expected to
further inCRease to 33% by 2020 and reach almost 43% of the total demand for butadiene by 2040.
ABS resin is the fastest growing application of butadiene in the Asian region, followed by Latex and
Rubber (SBR).

Until 2007, Asia was a net exporter of butadiene. Since 2008, it turned into an importer, as demand
outstripped and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years. China is a major importer,
importing from other countries in Asian region due to increasing demand. In 2013, China imported
around 370 KTA of butadiene. China butadiene import increased from 86 KTA in 2000 to 370 KTA in
2014 and is expected to further increase in the coming years, as demand continues to outgrow supply.

North America
The overall demand for butadiene in North America, between 2000 and 2014, declined by 2.3% on the
back of lowered downstream derivatives demand, the effect of the economic downturn in 2008-09 as
well as a decline in the supply as the country moved to lighter feedstocks in its crackers. The global
financial crisis dented the market demand severely, as it declined by 17.6% in 2008 and 5.3% in 2009
affecting the aggregate growth rate in the region. Though the demand showed a positive growth rate
of 4.4% and 4.3% in 2010 and 2011 respectively, it again contracted in 2012. The demand declined by
a further of 2.2% in 2014. The region has been experiencing a decline in SBR consumption due to
decline in passenger car production as well as an increase in imported vehicle tyres.
Overall utilisation rates have shown a declining trend in the region, dropping from mid 90s and low
90s at the start of the decade, to about mid-60s. This decline has been due to the lowering of the B/E
ratios in the region as the region moved towards lighter feedstocks with the discovery of shale gas.
The B/E ratios declined from 7.75 in 2000 to 4.9 in 2014 indicating the usage of lighter feedstocks in
the region. In the long term forecast, it is anticipated that utilisation rates will remain in the low to
mid 70s.

All the new ethylene capacities announced in the region expected to come up in the next 6 to 8 years
will be based on the shale gas discoveries utilising lighter feedstocks. As a result the amount of
butadiene produced as by-product will be in very small quantities. There is expected to be a drop in
the butadiene supply in the future, as a result of which on-purpose plants for butadiene production
have been announced. Historically, North America is the biggest importer of butadiene. However with
the start-up of TPC’s on-purpose butadiene plant as well as stagnant demand, the region will turn net
exporter by 2018 and is likely to remain in this status till the end of the forecast period. North American
markets are mature and automobile companies are shifting their base from there to other regions,
reducing the butadiene demand in coming years.

Middle East & Africa
Middle East & Africa’s average annual demand growth rate for butadiene during the period 2000 to
2014 was 3.5% p.a. It is evident that the demand increased in the region in the past 14 years at higher
rate from the small base. The regional demand mainly comes from butadiene rubber and SBR
applications mainly from the automobile sector as the increasing demand for automobiles in the
region, due to increasing population and Governments providing special incentives to develop the
downstream industries in the region.
The evolving trend in the region is the development of mixed feed crackers. A mixed-feed cracker will
enable the industry to be more flexible to crack the most advantaged feedstock. In the future, the
region will develop more mixed feed crackers to become more competitive.
Historically, the region has witnessed high utilisation rates in the high 80s to low 90s. The rates
lowered to 79% in 2014. In the long term forecast till 2040, the utilisation rates are likely to stabilise
in the level of low to mid 70s, with some speculative capacity to be added via on-purpose butadiene
production technology.

Outlook
The global butadiene market is undergoing significant changes. New regions are playing key roles,
while traditionally dominant markets are experiencing slower growth in both demand and production.
The continued emergence of China as a key market will continue to change the trade pattern.
Butadiene markets, especially in Asia, have suffered from tight supplies in recent years. Imports to the
region have increased steadily, especially to China. Although capacity additions in Asia during the 2014
to 2020 period will be significant, demand growth is still expected to exceed the capacity growth. Thus,
imports to the region are expected to continue to grow, with the North East Asia region becoming the
largest net importer of butadiene. Supply will be mostly provided by the rest of Asia, in particular the
Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East and Africa – as the region is gradually moving towards
heavier feeds.
Changing cracker feed slates will play a part in determining butadiene production levels. In North
America the B/E ratio is expected to continue to drop as the use of ethane from shale gas continues
thereby reducing butadiene production in the region. Nevertheless, the attractive pricing of LPG may
result in an on-purpose butadiene project emerging.


                                                                              170
The shift in synthetic rubber production to developing regions of Asia, Eastern Europe/FSU, and Latin
America will limit the demand growth in more established market regions of North America and
Western Europe.

Butadiene Trade Balance
Globally, butadiene imports were 450 kt in 2014, which is approximately 4.1% of the global demand.
Historically, the net exporting regions have been Western Europe, Indian Subcontinent, Middle East
& Africa and, to a lesser extent, South East Asia and South America. The net importing regions are
North East Asia and North America.
Until 2007, Asia was a net exporter of butadiene, as the region remained relatively self-sufficient due
to its large capacity for naphtha cracking. In recent years, imports increased as the supply became
tight due to increased butadiene demand. It is expected that new butadiene production capacity in
China will help reduce imports into the region for a couple of years, but in the longer term Asia is
expected to become the largest butadiene importing region, especially North East Asia. Butadiene
extraction capacity and on-purpose butadiene production capacity is being expanded at a faster rate
in Asia than anywhere else in the world, but is not adequate to match the growth in demand due to
rapidly expanding tyre manufacture and automobile demand across the region.
North America is likely to convert to a net exporter in the next few years and will maintain its status
as a net exporter of the product, with the start-up of on-purpose capacities and stagnant demand for
the product in the forecast years. The region is forecast to produce less butadiene as a by-product of
ethylene production due to the use of lighter feedstock in its domestic steam crackers.
Western Europe will remain a small exporter of the product in the long term as butadiene production
is expected to reduce as crackers turn to ethane based lighter feed stocks, in line with reducing
demand.
In the case of Central & Eastern Europe, post 2016 the region is likely to turn into a net exporter as
new butadiene capacity in Russia, Hungary and Poland is likely to produce adequate butadiene to
cater to the local demands as well as export to nearby regions.
Figure E-33 below highlights the global trade balance for butadiene and includes the outlook to 2040.

Butadiene Target Suppliers
In the Eastern Europe / FSU region, Poland is a consistent net importer of butadiene. Countries such
as Russia and Czech Republic, currently net exporters, are likely to maintain this status as new projects
are expected to come online by 2017 to meet the local demands as well as cater to export demand.
Hence, limited opportunities exist in Eastern Europe/FSU for sourcing butadiene required by Nairit
plant. In the case of Western Europe, while demand growth is mature, key countries such as France
and Belgium are still likely to experience growth in their butadiene demand and hence can be
considered as prospective importers rather than exporters. In Asia, China will remain the largest net
importer, paying a premium over European butadiene prices. Thus, other significant Asian markets
such as India are likely to route their butadiene to China and hence are unlikely to be cost effective at
providing butadiene to Armenia.

Armenia is a land locked country sharing its border with four countries. It is surrounded by Turkey on
the West, Azerbaijan on the East, Georgia on the North and Iran on the South side. Trade within the
country is highly dependent on transit through Georgia by rail and road, as explained below.
Supplies to Georgia generally have to come either via road from Turkey or Russia, or via its western
ports. The rail connection from Russia to Armenia is currently unavailable due to its passing through
South Abkhazia, whose government has blocked any rail communications with Georgia.
Due to political constraints between Armenia and its two neighbour countries, Turkey and Azerbaijan,
any trade arrangements with these countries are subject to political risk, although trade with Turkey
does occur regularly via neutral intermediaries. While Armenia maintains good relations with Iran, its
transport connection is dependent on a single road route. The table below shows the latest net
imports and market attractiveness for the project considering various factors like location, new
capacities and net imports in 2013. Table E-12 gives an overview of the key target regions to consider.

Jacobs Consultancy’s price forecasting methodology involves the development of cash production
costs at each stage of the production chain from crude oil to downstream product. This cash cost of
production, combined with a forecast of return on investment at each stage, gives a forecast of long
run marginal costs. This reflects the minimum price over the cycle at which producers will continue to
invest in new capacity.
The production process is broken into the following key steps:



                                                                  174
       Conversion of crude oil in the refinery into hydrocarbon feeds for the fuels and petrochemical
        sectors
       The production of olefins (principally ethylene and propylene) and aromatics
       The conversion of olefins and aromatics into petrochemical derivatives.
The cash cost of supply is determined by the full supply chain cost to key world markets, including
cash cost of production, freight, SG&A costs and R&D and technical service costs. Cost of supply is
forecast according to our estimates of the above factors, and based upon our projections for the prices
of each element within the price structure.
The key driver for cost of production for most petrochemicals is the prevailing oil price, as this
determines the feedstock cost and thus typically comprises a significant proportion of the full supply
chain cost. Our forecasts of crude oil price, on which the price forecasts in this report are based, are
discussed later in this section.
In establishing future costs of production, we also take into account the impact of the “experience
curve?. This reflects the decline in production costs over time, resulting from improvements in process
technology, increasing plant scale and other fixed cost efficiencies. For most refined fuels and
petrochemicals, production processes are relatively mature and thus only minor process
improvements are anticipated. Thus the major driver of future experience curve effects will be
increasing plant scale over the forecast period, with concomitant reductions in specific fixed costs.
The margin achieved by the producing industry is less easy to forecast than production costs, and can
vary significantly by industry. Margins are forecast taking into account the following factors:
       Projected supply/demand balance
       Historic margin performance
       Estimated reinvestment cost
       Competitive economics in different world regions
       Substitution effects in downstream markets
Typically, for commodity chemicals markets, the supply/demand situation will have the greatest
influence on margins achieved by producers in the short term, with a tight market supporting higher
prices. Conversely, when the market is long the bargaining power rests with the buyer, bidding prices
down. Longer term, however, margins will be predominantly determined by reinvestment economics
for the lead producer.
Other factors can influence margins, however, with some markets consistently achieving better
returns than others. One element that impacts the returns achieved by the producers is the industry
structure. The most important factor here is the number of players in the producer industry, with a
concentrated market structure where pricing is dominated by a few powerful producers tending to
support market discipline. For most commodity polymer markets, however, pricing corresponds
closely to that determined by free market economics.
The integration of these factors into our long term trend and cycle forecasts is discussed below.
In developing our price forecasts, we use cash flow return (CFR) as a benchmark for assessing the
margins achieved by producers. CFR is defined as follows:
        Cash Flow Return (CFR) % = cash margin, net of freight and selling costs ($/t)
                                                 replacement capital cost ($/t)




                                                  175
This reflects the instantaneous return on replacement capital in percentage terms and provides a
straightforward mechanism for comparing historic and future margins for the producing industry. It
should not be confused with IRR (Internal Rate of Return) however, which takes account of cash flow
movements through the entire life of a project.

Trend Forecasts
Most fuels and many petrochemical products can be characterised as commodity products, in that
they are produced to pre-defined specifications offering suppliers little opportunity to differentiate
themselves. Thus there is a single market price which pertains at any particular point of supply. Over
the long term, the market would thus be expected to respond to fundamental economics which
dictate that the price must be just sufficient to justify investment by a leading producer. If the price
were to remain at a higher level for a sustained period, new capacity would be attracted to the market,
thus bidding prices down. Conversely, prolonged periods of lower pricing inhibit investment and
eventually result in a shortfall in the supply/demand balance, which will cause prices to rise and attract
further investment.
This is the basis on which our trend price forecasts are determined, based on our estimation of cash
cost of supply, which, combined with a projection of return on investment, gives a forecast of long run
marginal cost and thus reflects the minimum price over the cycle at which producers will continue to
invest in new capacity.

Cycle Forecasts
Typically, petrochemicals exhibit a strong cyclicality in margins, reflecting primarily the impact of the
supply/demand balance. Occasional periods of tight supply and consequent high pricing/margins can
promote periods of over-building throughout the industry. The subsequent capacity overhang when
these facilities come on-stream initiates a period of over-supply and low pricing, during which
producers generally do not initiate substantive new investments. As the market and prices recover,
the cycle repeats itself.
Trough or “bottom-of-cycle? pricing levels are generally fairly predictable, with prices trending to the
cash cost of the marginal player. The marginal player is defined as the highest cost increment of supply
necessary to meet demand. Should prices fall below the cash cost of these producers, some capacity
will close, bringing the market closer to a balanced position and eventually initiating a recovery in
pricing and margins. Peak level pricing is less predictable and frequently initiated by unplanned
outages when the industry is operating at close to full capacity. Prices can rise rapidly—typically to
1.5 to 2 times trend pricing levels, although prices can be even higher than this for short periods.
Historically, the petrochemical cycle has had a period of around seven to eight years. However,
economic downturns are frequently initiated by events not directly connected with the
petrochemicals industry—the Arab Spring and the Eurozone crisis are examples of recent events that
would not have been predicted in a study of this type, yet have had a dramatic influence on economic
growth in general and hence on petrochemical demand.
We construct cycle prices based on the trend and bottom of cycle pricing, using an arithmetic
construct and allowing for a notional 8-year cycle.
We note however that the Cycle Case has no economic meaning, with only the Trend Case and the
Bottom of Cycle Case having any sort of solid basis in economic theory. Hence, Jacobs Consultancy
does not advise the use of Cycle Case prices for project planning, or any other long-term view on
project viability, but to use the Trend prices for project economic assessment and the Bottom of Cycle
prices (for shorter periods) to test project robustness in downturns. The inherent uncertainty in the
timing of the cycle means that investment decisions should be based on the Trend Case, which reflects
the underlying long-term market fundamentals


                                                   176
Downside Scenario Forecasts
We also model two additional “downside? pricing scenarios which seek to test the robustness of the
project opportunity to varying degrees of economic pessimism. We define the following two
downside cases as:
       Short-term Downside Prices. This scenario comprises bottom of cycle prices for all products
        for the first three years of commercial operation with trend prices thereafter. In reality, this
        would correspond to a prolonged recession coinciding with the first three years of commercial
        operation. This macroeconomic climate is generally the most adverse for the project.
       Long-term Downside Prices. All product prices are reduced by a relatively small fixed
        percentage equivalent to 3.0% of its price for the duration of the project. All feedstock prices
        are unchanged.

Oil Price Basis
The following four oil price scenarios have been considered in this Study:
       Base Oil Case—US$ 60/bbl (Brent FOB)
       Low Oil Case—US$ 40/bbl (Brent FOB)
       High Oil Case—US$ 80/bbl (Brent FOB)
       Very High Oil Case—US$ 100/bbl (Brent FOB)
These oil price scenarios are constant in money of the day terms for the duration of the economic
evaluation.

Butadiene Logistic Costs
We have estimated netback prices for use in the Financial Model for the Project, i.e. appropriate
market prices in Western Europe that have had logistics costs added to arrive at a hypothetical price
at the gate of the Nairit plant in Yerevan (“ex-gate? prices). These have been estimated on the basis
of distance between Yerevan and Western Europe (Rotterdam, Netherlands), allowing for additional
premium so as to account for difficult logistical constraints associated with delivery to Yerevan.
Our derived logistical cost is US$250 per metric ton of butadiene. This logistics cost figure is in 2015
terms and is subject to cost inflation as defined in the Financial Modelling section.
The logistical cost and is based on the following route:
       Supply from North West Europe by semi-pressurised ship to a Georgian port. The most likely
        candidate for this is the existing Batumi LPG terminal, which already handles around 3 kta of
        LPG for export. Alternatively, Poti terminal may be considered, which currently only processes
        liquids.
       Butadiene transport by Rail from Batumi to Yerevan using the existing rail network
        (e.g. Batumi – Tbilisi – Yerevan connection).
The above has the following cost implications for 2015:
 (i) West European (WE) Price – We forecast a West European Free Delivered (FD) market price for
     butadiene using the methodology described earlier.
 (ii) Rotterdam – Batumi shipping route is approximately 6 900 km (13 days charter). Based on the
      average of international shipping freight rate for other well-established routes such as WE –
      Med or Southern Russia – Med, as well as the monthly charter rates for a 3,500 m³ carrier, the
      estimated cost for the Rotterdam – Batumi transfer will be around US$185 per tonne.


                                                  177
(iii) Georgian Port charges are estimated at US$25 US per tonne, based on a suitable pro-rata of the
      existing LPG rates at Batumi LPG export terminal, with an additional US$10 per ton of butadiene
      charge premium to incentivise required investment.
(iv) The rail logistics component, based on the equivalent distance in Russia is around US$30 per
     tonne.
 (v) Thus, the butadiene costs (sourced from WE) at the Yerevan facility gates is:
                         P      =     (i)     +     (ii)    +     (iii)   +    (iv)
                         P      =     (i)     +     185     +     35      +    30
                         P      =     (i)     +     250


The assumption in the above calculation is that the owner of the Batumi LPG terminal, or the Poti port
will be willing to undertake the required expansion of its facilities, in return for new business. We
estimate that around 7 000 m³ of butadiene storage would be required, which could be achieved in a
single tank, which will require an investment of around US$15 million for the tank, offloading jetty
arms, rail loading line and associated piping and metering equipment.
Conversely, the costs may be lowered further if the feasibility of larger vessel receipt in Georgia is
confirmed (i.e. sufficient depth at port) or the butadiene shipping vessel is hired on a long term basis.
Should the idea of a new butadiene terminal at Poti prove infeasible due to any factors outside of
Armenian government control, an alternative method of butadiene delivery through Georgia is
possible, albeit at a higher cost. This would require for butadiene to be transported by rail to Varna,
Bulgaria. The rail cars will then be loaded onto a ferry and discharged at existing rail car terminal at
Poti, Georgia. From there, they may be further transported to Nairit plant, Yerevan, Armenia, using
the existing rail network (Poti – Tbilisi – Yerevan). At present, there are two operational rail ferry lines
operating between Varna, Bulgaria and Poti, Georgia, as well as Varna to Batumi, Georgia, both
operated by Navigation Maritime Bulgare (Navibulgar).
Overall, this is a more expensive mode of transportation, with the logistical cost estimated in the
range of US$290 – 410 per tonne, depending on the location of the source butadiene in Europe. The
high level estimate is as follows in 2015 money:
  (i) West European (WE) Price – We forecast a West European Free Delivered (FD) market price for
      butadiene using the methodology described earlier.
 (ii) The rail freight costs in Europe are highly dependent on the source of butadiene. For example:
        o   Assuming an Austrian location, OMV Schwechat refinery (near Vienna). The rail route to
            Burgas is some 1,500 km approximately, resulting in an estimated cost of US$160 per
            tonne of butadiene.
            Assuming a Rotterdam location. The rail route to Burgas is some 2,600 km approximately,
            resulting in an estimated cost of US$280 per tonne of butadiene.
(iii) Burgas terminal roll on / transhipment charge for loading of the rail cars is estimated at around
      US$25 per tonne.
(iv) Burgas – Poti / Batumi shipping route charge, 1170 km, based on the typical rail ferry size of 108
     rail cars and reported prices for the ferry charter, the freight is estimated at approximately
     US$50 per tonne.
 (v) Georgian Port charges for receipt and wheel gauge change are estimated at US$25 US per tonne.
(vi) The rail logistics component, based on the equivalent distance in Russia is around US$30 per
     tonne.

                                                    178
(vii) Thus, the butadiene costs (sourced from Austria) at the Yerevan facility gates is:
           P      =      (i)      +   (ii)    +   (iii)   +    (iv)    +    (v)     +      (vi)
           P      =      (i)      +   160     +   25      +    50      +    25      +      30
           P      =      (i)      +   290
(viii) Conversely, the butadiene costs (sourced from Netherlands) at the Yerevan facility gates is:
           P      =      (i)      +   (ii)    +   (iii)   +    (iv)    +    (v)     +      (vi)
           P      =      (i)      +   280     +   25      +    50      +    25      +      30
           P      =      (i)      +   410

Project Competitiveness
In this section, we examine the competitive position of the Nairit facility against competing producers
in Asia, the US and Western Europe. The comparison is based on the full cost of supply (on a delivered
cash cost basis). The costs thus include plant variable and fixed costs, product packaging, but exclude
delivery to market costs such as freight and tariffs, since these are different for each of the consider
target markets.

Basis and Methodology
To assess the relative competitiveness of a number of producers, Jacobs Consultancy has prepared a
comparative quantitative analysis based upon our estimates of other producers’ delivered cash costs
at defined gateways to the target market.

Key Assumptions
The following are the key assumptions for estimating the delivered cash cost:
       Plant archetypes – The plants that have been selected for comparison are representative
        leader plants of the regions in which they are located in terms of capacity, technology, level
        of vertical integration and other factors. They form a representative picture of the
        competition for the Project. There are actually only 8 such plants in current operation,
        excluding Nairit.
       Alternate Feeds – We have modelled the cost of production for various alternative
        configurations for PCR production that may be achieved at Nairit, reflecting that both
        butadiene and acetylene route processes exist at Nairit. Globally, we have modelled each
        plant individually, as follows:
         o   German and USA plants are based on the butadiene route process, purchasing chlorine
             and caustic soda from adjacent chlor-alkali units, owned by 3rd parties.
         o   Chinese producers, as well as Japanese Omi plant (Denka) are based on the acetylene
             route process, which is in turn produced from calcium carbide.
         o   Japanese Kawasaki (SDK) and Nanyo (Tosoh) plants are based on the butadiene route
             process, receiving chlorine and caustic soda from adjacent chlor-alkali units, owned by
             SDK and Tosoh respectively, on a transfer cost of production price basis.
       Year of analysis – The year 2015 has been selected for analysis as it corresponds to the most
        recent year, given that butadiene prices were not overly volatile in the last two years.
       Feedstock and product pricing basis – Trend market price forecasts were used for 2015.
       Transfer pricing – For vertically integrated plants, intermediate products are assumed to be
        internally transferred at their cash cost of production.
No capital charges or depreciation are included in this cost of production calculation. This is because
the purpose of the cash cost comparison is to demonstrate that in the event of a severe economic
downturn there will be an oversupply of capacity and market prices will be set by the Short Run
Marginal Cost of supply of the high cost producer. This is either the cash cost, or, in extremis, the
variable cost, of the highest cost suppliers to the project’s target markets. The aim of our analysis is
to demonstrate that in such a scenario the project can continue to operate profitably (though with
much reduced profitability) and can maintain its operations.
Our cost models for international producers are based upon public domain information that has been
collected over many years. Clearly however, the major factors that significantly differentiate



                                                  181
producers are the technology, feedstock cost, product export logistic costs and economies of scale in
production.

Cost Component Estimation
The cash cost of delivering product, calculated on per ton of product basis, are made from a
consideration of a large number of parameters, the principal ones being those described below.
       Feedstock cost – Estimated as the product of price and requirement per ton of product.
        Summed for all feeds.
       Co-product credit – Estimated as the product of price and co-product yield per ton of product.
        Summed for all co-products.
       Utility, catalyst and chemical costs – Estimated as the requirement of each utility or catalyst
        per ton of product multiplied by their individual price.
       Replacement capital cost – We estimate the replacement capital cost for each plant on the
        basis of a published reference plant capital cost. We will adjust this reference plant cost for
        capacity, location, technology, year of EPC and other factors as appropriate. The replacement
        capital cost is used to estimate a number of fixed costs such as maintenance cost.
       Fixed costs – The estimate for the fixed cost of production is based on an estimate of the
        manpower required to operate the plant from which various other costs are scaled. Thus the
        starting point is an estimate of the total number of staff directly involved in the operation of
        the plant multiplied by their individual costs (expressed in US$ per man-year). We estimate
        the number of operators, foremen and supervisors. The cost of employees that are engaged
        in overhead activities such as laboratory work, engineering, HR, IT, business planning and so
        on are estimated as a proportion of this cost.
       Maintenance cost – Estimated as a percentage of replacement capital cost (2.0% of ISBL +
        OSBL). The figure includes both the labour and material costs for ongoing maintenance as
        well as the normal periodic turnarounds but not for any plant capacity debottlenecking.
       SG&A cost, which represent selling, general, and administrative expenses – as a percentage
        of product market price (3.0%). This also includes the handling cost incurred for loading and
        unloading the product at the port.

PCR Competitiveness
This section discusses the assessment of the competitive position of Nairit’s production plant on
exports globally against that of other exporters to this market. The Nairit facility has the ability to
produce the PCR via either butadiene and/or acetylene, but the butadiene route allows for a more
competitive cost of production. The comparison for various acetylene based routes against the
butadiene route process is provided below.




                                                  182

For the acetylene route based process, the option of production of acetylene via a new plasma arc
process (ISP technology) is marginally more cost effective than that of a new BASF partial oxidation
process. The existing partial oxidation unit suffers from a design flaw which has precluded it from
achieving its design process performance (i.e. the design 6,500 Nm³ of natural gas per ton of acetylene
vs. achieved 8,200 Nm³). The benefits of syngas by-product utilisation for additional chemical
production are rather muted, since additional natural gas will be required to generate the necessary


                                                   183
steam, as well as additional return will be required to justify the extra investment into this new
chemical unit, plus the operation of this unit will require additional fixed and variable costs, thereby
negating any syngas by-product credit to the acetylene price formation. Even assuming a particularly
favourable combination of both new POX and syngas utilisation at chemical value, the acetylene based
PCR rubber will still be significantly less competitive than that derived via butadiene.
Please note that process options for 12 kta PCR production via acetylene scenario have not been
considered here, since these offer even worse cost of production performance than that of 24 kta PCR
production via acetylene, as the fixed costs per tonne of acetylene will be much larger, given the
negative economy of scale.
The competitiveness of the butadiene based production at Nairit site is assessed against the following
producers:
       Denka / Mitsui 75 kta facility in the USA producing the PCR from butadiene feedstock
        (previously owned by DuPont)
       Lanxess Germany 83 kta in Germany producing the PCR from butadiene feedstock
       Denka Japan 100 kta facility in Japan producing the PCR from acetylene feedstock, which is in
        turn produced from local calcium carbide.
       Tosoh Japan 34 kta facility in Japan producing the PCR from butadiene feedstock
       SDK Japan 23 kta facility in Japan producing the PCR from butadiene feedstock
       Three Chinese plants
         o   SSRGC* (Shanxi Synthetic Rubber Group Company) 30 kta facility in China producing PCR
             from acetylene feedstock, which is in turn produced from local calcium carbide.
         o   SSRGC* (Shanxi Synthetic Rubber Group Company) / Nairit JV 30 kta facility in China
             producing PCR as above
         o   CCC Co. (Chongqing Changshou Chemical Co.) 30 kta facility in China producing PCR as
             above
The figure and table below provide our assessment of the cash cost competitive position of the PCR
production by Nairit when compared to other producers.

For all cases, a major cost component is the cost of production of the chloroprene monomer, which
in turn is mostly influenced by the price of butadiene and acetylene, depending on which process
route is used by any given producer. The long term trend acetylene price is driven by either natural
gas (Nairit) or calcium carbide prices (Denka Japan, Chinese producers). These in turn are subject to
local conditions and general availability. The long term trend butadiene price is driven by the Brent
crude oil price.
We have also analysed the effect of varying Brent crude oil price on the PCR supply curve. The results
are presented below.

Note 1: Butadiene trend pricing at US$80 per barrel of Brent crude Oil

From the figures and tables above, it can be seen that even relatively large variations in the price of
Brent Crude Oil do not significantly alter the supply curve, with both USA and German butadiene based
plants remaining the most cost efficient by a relatively large margin.
Even though butadiene delivered costs to Nairit plant gate are not necessarily the highest, both high
utility (electricity and natural gas for steam) prices, as well as sub-optimal plant performance
(relatively high butadiene, chlorine and caustic consumptions per ton of chloroprene monomer) make
it difficult for the Nairit plant to compete globally, relegating it to a relatively laggard cost producer
position, with only Tosoh 34 kta and SDK 23 kta plant at Kawasaki, as well as the three Chinese plants
having a higher cost structure per tonne of PCR produced.
If the above is considered in conjunction with the required return (14%) on the necessary capital
investment (US$264 million) to enable a restart of production at Nairit plant via butadiene process,
Nairit will have a higher cost of production than that of Chinese producers at the plant gate, before
any additional product delivery costs are considered.




                                                          187
Thus, considering the above cost structure, Nairit’s best hope lies in competing with existing Chinese
producers who are currently the marginal cost producers. However, the overwhelming majority of
Chinese produced PCR is sold to the local Chinese market, which is both tariff protected from foreign
imports and requires an additional delivery charge of at least US$150 per tonne of PCR to freight the
product from Armenia to Chinese ports in 2015 money of the day. In summary, in order to be cost
competitive Nairit requires a number of conditions to be favourable such as:
       Low crude oil prices
       Allowed entry into Chinese markets
       Reduced project return expectations to mitigate the effect of the capital charge
       Reduced competitor operating rates

Project Financial Modelling
Methodology and Assumptions
General and Financial Assumptions
A Financial Model has been prepared with the following general and financial basis and assumptions:
       All cash flows in nominal (“money of the day?) terms in US dollars
       Corporate tax rate of 20%, no corporate tax holiday
       Depreciation is 20 years straight line methodology
       No bank loan
       Start-up of plant at start of 2019
       20 years of operations modelled
       Plant terminal value is equal to 400% of year 19 EBITDA
       AMD to USD FX rate was fixed at 415

Inflation Assumptions
A number of inflation assumptions are included in the Financial Model to allow the cost of individual
parameters to increase over time. These assumptions are listed below:
       US dollar general rate of inflation 2.0% per year
       Labour cost rate of inflation 2.0% per year
       Long term capital cost inflation 2.0% per year
       Power price increase 2.0% per year
       Logistics cost rate of inflation 2.0% per year.




                                                   189
Utility Prices
Our assumption of natural gas price as well as other utility prices is set out in the table below. We
have assumed a price for 2019 that is equal to the highest of Nairit’s prices in the forecast years.
Table E-16: Utility Pricing Assumptions.

Note: Both actual prices and forecast prices include VAT
Other utility prices are estimated based upon the above inputs.

Operating Hours and Operating Rate
The Financial Model does not account for shutdown years; instead, it works on an average year of
operation, at 8,000 operating hours, with the effect of shutdowns incorporated into the average
number of hours of availability.
The operating rate, which is applied to the number of hours available for years 1, 2 and 3+ are 75%,
90%, and 100% respectively. Again, this is a conservative estimate in terms of the ramp-up rate.

Marketing Costs
We understand that a high proportion of the PCR production is to be sold through agents, which will
require a supplemental marketing cost. Our assumptions in this regard are as follows:
           Proportion of PCR production marketed by agents:                          80% of total production
           Marketing fee on agency sales:                                            3.0% of product sale price

Labour Costs
The labour costs have been calculated on the basis of an average salary of US$5,493 per annum. Note
that these labour costs include not only the cost of the plant operators but also all support staff (e.g.
maintenance) and plant management.
The actual number of employees is based on the man-power estimates and is as follows:
       436 employees for 12 kta of PCR via acetylene
       488 employees for 24 kta of PCR via acetylene
       380 employees for 25 kta of PCR via butadiene

Other Fixed Costs
Maintenance costs were set as 2% of the plant’s replacement CAPEX value for a particular year.

Working Capital
The working capital for the integrated project has been allocated as follows:
       45 days of payables
       45 days of receivables
       15 days of product inventory
       45 days of butadiene at cost (for 25 kta butadiene case only)

The above estimate assumes no further development costs (e.g. FEED, EIA, surveys), no PMC costs
and zero financing charges, as we assume that the plant will be equity financed in absence of any clear
project financing plan. We have only allocated a small license fee for the butadiene scenario, payable
to the licensor of the new chlor-alkali process unit. However, if any of the acetylene based scenarios
were chosen and a new acetylene production unit installed with assistance from the technology

licensors (BASF for partial oxidation or ISP for plasma arc processes), then an additional license fee
should be allocated for such cases.

Summary of Modelling Assumptions
To fully appreciate the financial viability of the project, a ‘Base Case’ scenario is clearly defined by the
following input parameters:
       Base Oil Price Scenario at US$ 60 per bbl of Brent crude Oil and trend feedstock and product
        pricing;
       Jacobs Consultancy’s CAPEX estimates. Note that Base Case does not provide for a CAPEX
        contingency;
       Operating rate in years 1-20 as indicated in the previous section
       All annual inflation assumptions as indicated in the previous section
       All general and financial assumptions as indicated in the previous section
       No current debt, previously incurred, has been modelled. The asset is assumed to be debt
        free.
In the following sections, we present the results for each of the following plant configurations:
       12 kta acetylene based PCR production
       24 kta acetylene based PCR production
       25 kta butadiene based PCR production
A flexible Financial Model, provided separately with this report, contains additional input parameters,
which can then be used to study a large number of “Sensitivity Cases? to be defined as required by
World Bank.

Summary of Modelling Results
Under all of the considered scenarios, the project yields negative project returns. The 25 kta butadiene
based scenario results in the least negative results, followed by 12 kta acetylene based scenario, as
the project generates less absolute negative monies than a larger 24 kta acetylene based scenario. For
the acetylene based cases, the option of using ISP plasma arc process for acetylene generation, yields
the least negative results at current prices for natural gas and electricity.

Acetylene Based Production of 12 kta PCR Financial Results
The table below shows our estimates of the financial analysis for the Base Case where 12 kta of PCR
is produced based on an acetylene feedstock. The IRR/NPV figures are based on 20 years of cash flow
modelling and the payback estimate is a simple, undiscounted measure of the payback period.

Project returns of the Base Case for 12 kta acetylene PCR production are not attractive for any specific
discount rate and yield negative values of NPV and IRR over the entire lifespan of the plant. This is
driven by a number of factors:
        High natural gas prices, which also result in high cost of steam to be generated internally.
        High CAPEX investment requirement per tonne of installed PCR production
        Poor process performance of the existing partial oxidation (POx) process used to generate
         acetylene necessary to produce the chloroprene monomer.
        Poor process performance of the existing chlor-alkali unit, owing to equipment age, resulting
         in high costs of production of chlorine and caustic soda.
        High electricity prices.
         There could be some room for process improvements in order to reduce power consumption
         or an opportunity to negotiate a better deal for power supply pricing.
The project will not be able to recoup the required investments within the 20 years operational period
of the project.

Acetylene Based Production of 24 kta PCR Financial Results
The table below shows our estimates of the financial analysis for the JC case where 24 kta of PCR is
produced based on an acetylene feedstock. The IRR/NPV figures are based on 20 years of cash-flow
modelling and the payback estimate is a simple, undiscounted measure of the payback period.

Project returns of the Base Case for 24 kta acetylene PCR production are not attractive for any specific
discount rate and yield negative values of NPV and IRR over the entire lifespan of the plant. Even if a
theoretical access to new modern acetylene production technology (BASF partial oxidation or ISP
plasma arc) is obtained, the returns are still negative. This is driven by a number of factors:
       High natural gas prices, which also result in high cost of steam to be generated internally.
       High CAPEX investment requirement per tonne of installed PCR production
       Poor process performance of the existing partial oxidation (POx) process used to generate

SWOT Analysis of the Nairit Chemical
Plant




                  197
Introduction
In accordance with our technical assignment, Jacobs Consultancy visited the Nairit plant during the
last week of February 2015. The purpose of the site visit was to assess the present condition of the
assets of CJSC “Nairit Plant? and collect all the necessary information with regards to the examined
assets.
The present report contains our SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunity, Threats) assessment for
the potential restart of chloroprene rubber production on Nairit site.
The above was considered with a view to restarting production under one of the three currently
considered production scenarios:
      12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
      24 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
      25 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via butadiene route




                                                198
SWOT Analysis
The purpose of conducting this type of detailed analysis for each section of the NAIRIT
Polychloroprene rubber (PCR) manufacturing facility is to highlight the key characteristics of the
production section that will have a significant effect on the future performance of the whole business.
The term SWOT is defined below:
       STRENGTHS – describes the characteristics that the facility possesses to contribute to the
        overall business success. What are the main attributes of the process that provide a means of
        the business maintaining its competitive advantage?
       WEAKNESSES – describes the limitations that the facility possesses that could, if not
        addressed, result in poor overall business performance (many of these limitations maybe
        inherent in the facility and will need to be fully understood). Is there an action plan in place to
        attempt to overcome these weaknesses?
       OPPORTUNITIES – describes the particular opportunities that could be derived from that
        particular section of the facility to enhance the business performance. This analysis is usually
        applied to factors external to the business but we have combined this with internal features.
       THREATS – describes the external elements in the environment (political, social,
        environmental etc.) that could cause difficulties to the business to operate successfully. We
        have adapted this concept to also describe factors that may have a negative effect on the
        whole facility operation.

Summary
Based on market, technical and financial analysis described as well as the SWOT analysis contained
within this report, none of the proposed scenarios are at present particularly attractive, with 25 kta
production via the butadiene route being the most favourable of the 3 options considered.
The summary of the key issues is as follows:
       For all considered cases, the plant equipment is very old, and has largely reached the end of
        its useful life.
       Natural gas supply is very expensive and affects the two scenarios for production via acetylene
        disproportionately more, as gas is used as the main process feedstock.
       The butadiene route is exposed to butadiene logistics, which are thought of as challenging and
        are at present not clearly defined. However, our analysis shows that delivery of butadiene to
        site is feasible, albeit with a significant logistical cost.
       Product logistics are less challenging, but still rely on access to a port in a 3 rd country, with
        Georgian ports being the most likely candidates. This results in significant costs for delivery of
        the product to customers.
       Substantial capital investment required to restart operations under any of these scenarios.
       Both 24 kta via acetylene route and 25 kta via butadiene route benefit from greater economy
        of scale, but in turn are more exposed to global markets, and as such are more threatened by
        fluctuation in global demand for polychloroprene rubber, as well as the behaviour of other
        major producers.
       Both acetylene route scenarios are inherently more complex and more dangerous than the
        butadiene route scenario. This contributes to the lower overall cost of production via the
        butadiene route.


                                                   199
       Nairit’s product will be sold on the international market, allowing for major foreign currency
        import to Armenia.
       As a sole chemicals processing plant in Armenia, this facility has high strategic value, enabling
        a downstream enterprise park to be set up in the adjacent industrial park or within selected
        areas of the Nairit site.

12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
Strengths
The major strengths of this option are listed below:
    1. Lowest capital investment option.
    2. Natural gas feed stock provides some measure of raw material independence; although the
       price is fixed by an external organisation.
    3. Relatively small impact on the global PCR market should allow for high utilisation of installed
       capacity, as its products may be sold into nearby Former Soviet Union and Middle East
       countries without entering into a pricing war with its major competitor in these markets
       (Lanxess, Germany).
    4. The integrated full chain of production units is available on site, resulting in transfer pricing
       for all key intermediate chemicals necessary for polychloroprene rubber production (i.e.
       chlorine, HCl, acetylene, chloroprene monomer, caustic soda).
    5. Some of the existing plant equipment may be reused, either to re-enter operation or as spare
       parts to support the new investment.
    6. Considerable operations experience on the site for the process unit operations.
    7. Local own brine supply of adequate quality for the existing Chlor-Alkali units.
    8. High speed response to the maintenance operation with the ability of the site personnel to
       fabricate new parts for the equipment (e.g. copper electrodes for Chlor-Alkali electrolysers,
       simple vessels, piping).
    9. A more efficient addition of chlorine to produce the chloroprene monomer (in comparison to
       the butadiene route) results in a lower capacity requirement for the chlor-alkali unit (which is
       the main electric power consumer on site).
    10. The site has its own pilot polymerisation unit which allows it to maintain high quality control
        over the product, resulting in less wastage and the ability to producer on-spec products.
    11. The PCR produced by the Nairit facility in the past was of good quality and had a good
        reputation in the market place. The Nairit PCR products are known globally and Nairit has
        been active in the PCR market for many years, prior to the shut-down of operations in 2010.
    12. Many of the Nairit PCR products manufactured at the site have been approved in critical
        applications where there is a significant barrier to entry for the competition (i.e. automotive
        applications, cables etc).
    13. Nairit’s product will be sold on the international market, allowing for major foreign currency
        import to Armenia.
    14. As the sole chemicals processing plant in Armenia, this facility has high strategic value,
        enabling a downstream enterprise park to be set up in the adjacent industrial park or within
        selected areas of the Nairit site.

   15. Secure supply of electrical power from the local utility provider from a natural gas power
       station.

Weaknesses
The major weaknesses of this option are listed below:


   1. Lowest cost efficiency of production of the three options, due to small scale (increased capital
      investment per tonne of production capacity installed, increased operations and maintenance
      costs).
   2. The existing acetylene production unit is (A) is in a very poor condition (B) has a design fault
      resulting in excessive natural gas consumption. The net effect is that the existing unit is both
      inefficient and unsafe to operate, requiring licensor involvement to correct the design fault
      and substantial capital investment to restore the unit.
   3. The price of natural gas supply is outside Nairit’s control and currently is set at prohibitively
      high levels.
   4. The price of electric power supply is outside Nairit’s control and currently is set at prohibitively
      high levels.
   5. The existing equipment and surrounding infrastructure is in very poor condition with
      significant evidence of major deterioration of the mechanical integrity of the facility.
   6. As the facility has historically relied on the ‘make it in-house’ approach has perpetuated its
      reliance on out-dated technology and impeded technological progress and improved
      operational efficiency.
   7. The lack of capital investment has resulted in the obsolescence of the facility and has impeded
      the facility from adopting more modern technology both in terms of operational efficiency
      and overall health and safety.
   8. Reliance on outdated manual operation has resulted in the facility being operated with
      excessive manual intervention and thus having low operability and efficiency. In the event of
      operations being resumed, substantial culture change and operator training will be necessary.
   9. The continued use of diaphragm cell technology for Chlor-Alkali operations, where asbestos
      is used in the construction of the diaphragm results in lower efficiency, additional capital costs
      and HSE concerns.
   10. The spent asbestos from the cells has to be disposed of in accordance with modern health and
       safety practice and results in a higher operational cost.
   11. Unsuitable HSE performance; gas detectors are not installed, flares are heavily corroded, no
       environmental monitoring instruments seen.
   12. Higher amounts of chlorinated waste by-products (than obtained via butadiene route) which
       need to be safely incinerated to avoid dioxin formation and its subsequent release to
       atmosphere.
   13. A new Air Separation Unit is required, resulting in additional capital investment.
   14. It is likely that in times of crisis or reduced power generation capacity that the Nairit
       production site will not be a priority customer for the power company, risking supply
       disruption.
   15. Failure to address the excessive staffing of the plant will result in loss of margin for the PCR &
       revenue for the project.

Opportunities
The major opportunities of this option are listed below:
    1. Potential for relatively quick implementation, given large scale of spare surviving equipment
    2. A reduction in natural gas pricing will substantially improve process economics.
    3. Additional small tonnage specialty chemicals production from associated by-products may
       help to further marginally increase the profitability of operations.
    4. The routing of syngas (by-product of acetylene production) for additional steam generation
       will allow reduced natural gas consumption on site. This option is perceived as more beneficial
       than routing the syngas for additional chemical production, since less capital investment is
       required (i.e. new dual fuel steam boiler vs. an additional chemical production unit, its
       associated infrastructure, plus new natural gas steam boiler).
    5. Potential introduction of new acetylene production technology (either new design from BASF
       for the partial oxidation of natural gas or ISP plasma arc) will lead to substantial process
       operation improvement.
    6. A switch to a new (membrane) chlor-alkali production technology, as well as a new Air
       Separation Unit, will allow reduced overall electricity consumption of the site, and thereby the
       cost of production, albeit at the expense of larger capital investment.
    7. Polychloroprene is typically exported in rather small 25 kg bags, leading to relatively high
       packaging costs. Introduction of a price incentive to recover the bags from clients at a reduced
       price may go towards improving the overall cost of production. Options towards shipping in
       bigger bags / containers should also be explored.
    8. There are opportunities to expand the present production to the original name plate of the
       process over the early years of operation at an acceptable capital investment cost.
    9. The use of target marketing of the PCR product into the higher value sectors of the market
       could bring improved returns to Nairit. Focus efforts to develop the Nairit sales force rather
       than agents.
    10. Nairit has a polymerisation pilot plant on the site which can be used for new product
        development into some of the high value sectors. This is a valuable asset not available to many
        of the competition.
    11. The development of an enterprise park on the Nairit site (with the support of the government)
        could bring additional value to Nairit as small enterprises could be set up to process the PCR
        into final products.
    12. There is ample room to improve the process efficiency and asset management of the site in
        order to increase the overall economic efficiency of the presently considered investment.
    13. Large amount of redundant processing equipment will be an additional source of revenue
        during the clearing of the site.

Threats
The major threats of this option are listed below:
    1. Higher cost of production scenario than that of production via butadiene route. This will
       hamper the ability of Nairit to compete with other producers and excessively expose it to
       market demand fluctuations, as its large cost of production will threaten the overall
       profitability of operations.



                                                 202
    2. The need to recoup the capital costs associated with the reconstruction of the plant to enable
       process operations, places a very large burden on the cost of production structure of Nairit.
    3. The Nairit processing plant could be priced out of the market by other producers increasing
       production in countries with access to cheaper raw materials and easier transport routes to
       major markets.
    4. Exposed to natural gas pricing mechanisms, which are outside Nairit’s control.
    5. Exposed to electric power pricing mechanisms, which are outside Nairit’s control.
    6. The project is insufficiently defined at present to give confidence in its speedy implementation
       and cost control (i.e. the overall project definition is lacking, there are no provisions for how
       the project will be financed, there are no construction contractors currently lined up to
       execute the work, there are no process licensors other than Nairit itself that can guarantee
       the process performance).
    7. The overall process route is inherently more hazardous than chloroprene monomer
       production via butadiene. On 14 May 2009, an explosion occurred in the hydro-chlorination
       section of this chloroprene monomer production unit, resulting in four fatalities and injuries
       to other personnel.
    8. Improvement to the cost of production of acetylene intermediate is a key step towards
       lowering the overall cost of production of PCR product. In order to achieve this, it will be
       necessary to involve an acetylene technology holder / licensor. However, access to modern
       technology may not be possible if either BASF or ISP consider the Nairit project to be a
       competitive threat, or of little interest.
    9. Failure to adequately address the poor condition of the site and to clear the derelict and/or
       decommissioned process equipment could result in environmental damage & loss of
       production. Any contamination events that are left unchecked could cause significant
       business disruption.

24 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
Strengths
The major strengths of this option are listed below:
    1. Same strengths as those listed for 12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route under
       items 2, 4 – 15.
    2. More cost efficient mode of production, when compared to analogous 12 kta scenario, due to
       larger scale (increased capital investment per tonne of production capacity installed,
       increased operations and maintenance costs).

Weaknesses
The major weaknesses of this option are listed below:
    1. Same weaknesses as those listed for 12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
       under items 2 – 15.
    2. Highest capital investment option.

Opportunities
The major opportunities of this option are listed below:
    1. Same opportunities as those listed for 12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
       under items 2 – 14.

                                                  203
Threats
The major threats of this option are listed below:
    1. Same threats as those listed for 12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route under
       items 1 – 9.
    2. Higher cost of production scenario than that of 25 kta of polychloroprene rubber via
       butadiene. This will hamper the ability of Nairit to compete with other producers and
       excessively expose it to market demand fluctuations, as its large cost of production will
       threaten the overall profitability of operations.
    3. While this option benefits from greater economy of scale, compared to 12 kta via acetylene
       route, it is in turn more exposed to global markets, and as such is more threatened by
       fluctuation in global demand for polychloroprene rubber, as well as the behaviour of other
       major producers.

25 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via butadiene route
Strengths
The major strengths of this option are listed below:


    1. Same strengths as those listed for 12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route under
       items 4 – 6, 8, 10 – 15.
    2. Lowest cost of production option, which maximises Nairit’s ability to compete with other
       polychloroprene rubber producers.
    3. While the quality of local brine supply is such that it will need further purification to make it
       suitable for a new membrane Chlor-Alkali production unit, this is not overly costly, and results
       in cheaper cost of brine feedstock than that enjoyed by competitors that have to buy solar or
       vapour salt on the market for the chlor-alkali unit operations.
    4. A simpler and less hazardous production route compared to the two production options via
       acetylene route.
    5. No asbestos material handling required (i.e. new membrane chlor-alkali unit).
    6. Less exposed to natural gas prices than either of the two production options via acetylene
       route.
    7. Not exposed to 3rd party licensor risk (i.e. no need for acetylene production).
    8. No need to find a suitable syngas utilisation option.
    9. Exotic materials of construction used for the original chloroprene production unit (from
       butadiene) afford greater confidence in equipment still having useful operation life in it and
       thus available for re-use.
    10. Less chlorinated waste by-products, resulting in a more environmentally friendly operation.
    11. No need for new air separation unit.


Weaknesses
The major weaknesses of this option are listed below:

                                                  204
    1. Same weaknesses as those listed for 12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
       under items 3 – 8, 11, 14, 15.
    2. Exposed to butadiene supply logistical challenges, as there is no butadiene production in
       Armenia. Thus, a significant part (if not all) of butadiene imports must proceed through a port
       in a 3rd country with rail or road connection to Armenia. This will most likely be either the
       Georgian port of Poti or Batumi. Neither of these ports has adequate import facilities at
       present.
    3. Requires rail infrastructure investment on site to receive butadiene rail shipments as delivered
       after transhipment in the 3rd party port (i.e. Batumi or Poti).
    4. Higher capital investment required than that for the option of 12 kta of polychloroprene
       rubber, via acetylene route.
    5. Still relatively high cost of production when compared to main competitor (Lanxess, Germany)
       supplying customers in Europe or Former Soviet Union countries.

Opportunities
The major opportunities of this option are listed below:


    1. Same opportunities as those listed for 12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route
       under items 7 – 13.
    2. A reduction in natural gas and/or electricity pricing will improve process economics, albeit to
       a lower degree than it does for the two options via acetylene route.
    3. Opportunistic / spot delivery of butadiene from Iran (Tabriz) may be feasible and allow
       diversifying from the difficult logistic supply route for butadiene from Europe or elsewhere.

Threats
The major threats of this option are listed below:
    1. Same threats as those listed for 12 kta of polychloroprene rubber, via acetylene route under
       items 2 – 6, 9 .
    2. Subject to stability and pricing of butadiene supply route (e.g. political stability and good will
       in Georgia).
    3. While this option benefits from greater economy of scale, compared to 12 kta via acetylene
       route, it is in turn more exposed to global markets, and as such is more threatened by
       fluctuation in global demand for polychloroprene rubber, as well as the behaviour of other
       major producers.

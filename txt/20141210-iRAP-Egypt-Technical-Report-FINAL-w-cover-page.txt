1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes are a major and growing public health epidemic. Each year, an
estimated number of 1.24 million people (WHO) die in road crashes and the number of seriously injured is as
high as 50 million. Road crashes are now the leading cause of death of children and young people aged
between 10 and 24. The burden of road crashes is comparable with malaria and tuberculosis, and costs 1-
3% of the world’s GDP. Almost nine out of ten road deaths and serious injuries occur in developing
countries. Whereas road deaths are expected to fall in high-income countries, they are likely to increase by
more than 80% in the rest of the world. In developing countries, it is the poor that are most vulnerable.
Pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists are many times more likely than car occupants to be harmed on the
roads. Unless preventative measures are put in place, the number of killed will almost double by 20301.


1.2 Egypt Road Assessment Program
Egypt is a middle-income country, belonging to the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). It has a
population of 81,121,080, with the GNI of USD 2,420. Egypt used to be the worst performing EMR country,
with just over 45 fatalities per 100,000 population (according to WHO 2004 modelled data). Though the
number of reported road traffic fatalities decreased to 7,3982 in 2010 (74%M, 26%F), from about 12,2953 in
2007, it will be necessary to undertake more action and additional measures to face these road safety
challenges. One of the measures includes a road survey of the Egyptian road network, in order to eliminate
deficiencies of the existing roads and help build a safer road infrastructure for all road users.
To that end, and in order to prevent unnecessary deaths and injuries, the World Bank (WB) has undertaken
a road safety assessment program in Egypt. The World Bank Global Road Safety facility through the
Bloomberg Philanthropies RS10 program has funded the Road Survey and Coding tasks which were
delivered on March 31, 2014. The World Bank Global Road Safety Facility and the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) Region have financed the analysis, reporting and training tasks that are part of this
Programme’s Terms of Reference.


1.3       Objectives of the Program
The objective of the Program is to assess the safety of about 2,100 km of main roads in Egypt and build
capacity for a sustainable road safety, in the field of road safety inspection and maintenance and network
safety management.
The objectives include the following tasks:
          Survey 2,100 km of roads that are managed by the General Authority for Roads, Bridges and Land
           Transport and code the video survey data according to the International Road Assessment
           Programme (iRAP) Survey and Coding specification.

       Collect crash data, traffic flow and speed data for the 2,100 km according to the iRAP Data Analysis
        and Reporting specification.
       Produce an iRAP input file which includes all road attributes and collected data. Produce Star Rating
        results and Safer Roads Investment Plan to identify areas of high risk and to shape future road
        safety investment.
       Produce a detailed technical report in accordance with iRAP Data Analysis and Reporting
        specification
The General Authority of Roads, Bridges and Land Transport (GARBLT) has overseen the implementation of
the Project.
The ARRB (Australian Road Research Board), which was founded in 1960 and incorporated in 1965, and is
engaging in science and technical research in highway traffic and transportation field, has been providing
trusted advice, technical expertise and solutions to transport and road agencies across the world. ARRB was
invited by the WB to undertake the Egypt road assessment project in conjunction with the Indian Road
Survey and Management pvt Ltd.
The quality assurance review and data processing was carried out by the Serbian AMSS-CMV.
The project inception visit was in September 2012, and the work was finished in December 2014.
After the road inspection, coding, collection of supporting data, data processing and analyses and reporting
have been completed, and priority locations or sections of the road identified, Safer Roads Investment Plans
(SRIP) have been tailored for identified road sections in order to suit specific circumstances, i.e. improve
road safety at this particular location, for all road users.


1.4 Project deliverables
The deliverables of the project include the following:

       Supporting Data in Excel Format collected according to RAP-SR-3-2.
       Processing and analysis
       iRAP upload file according to RAP-SR-3-3
       Reporting and training
       Full technical report
       Summary report
       Training to GARBLT Staff on the use of ViDA tool and how the Star Rating and Safer Roads
        Investment Plan models of iRAP works in conjunction with the results for Egypt programme.
This report is the full technical report which includes all information about the project. Stakeholders can also

1.5 Egypt capacity building
The Government of Egypt initiated this Road Assessment Programme whose objective is to assess the
safety of 2,100 km of main roads in Egypt and build capacity within the General Authority of Roads, Bridges
and Land Transport (GARBLT), in the areas of road safety inspection and network safety management,
using the methodologies of the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP). In December 2012 the
Ministry of Transport and World Bank established a de facto Steering Committee with all matters relating to
the project being shared in regular meetings including some or all of senior representatives of the Ministry
GARBLT, the World Bank and their advisers and, where appropriate, iRAP or EuroRAP.

In order to help the road assessment staff from Egypt to build a team for iRAP project in Egypt, a special
training for ViDA was conducted by the Serbian AMSS-CMV and RAP staff.
ViDA is the new software that has been developed within the iRAP programme. It contributes to a higher
quality of analysis that was available previously and to a more comprehensive processing of data of the
roads that have been surveyed and coded. It is a vital part of making a world free of high risk roads.
A training concerning the use of ViDA software was held for the Egypt programme staff and included the
following:
      How to apply for a new user name of ViDA
      Functional components of ViDA
      How to import the coding data into ViDA

      How to set up the parameters, such as facilities costs, accident data, etc.
      How to view the outcomes, including the star rating maps, Safer Roads Investment Plans (SRIP), etc.

1.6 Methodology
The protocols used here were developed by the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP). iRAP is
a registered charity dedicated to saving lives through safer roads.
iRAP provides tools and training to help countries make roads safe. Its activities include:
       inspecting high-risk roads and developing Star Ratings, Safer Roads Investment Plans and Risk
        Maps,
       providing training, technology and support that will build and sustain national, regional and local
        capability,
       tracking the road safety performance so that funding agencies can assess the benefits of their
        investments.
The programme is the umbrella organisation for EuroRAP, AusRAP, usRAP, KiwiRAP and ChinaRAP. Road
Assessment Programmes (RAP) are now active in more than 70 countries throughout Europe, Asia Pacific,
North, Central and South America and Africa.
iRAP is financially supported by the FIA Foundation for the Automobile and Society and the Road Safety
Fund. Projects receive support from the Global Road Safety Facility, automobile associations, regional
development banks and donors.
National governments, automobile clubs and associations, charities, automotive industry and institutions,
such as the European Commission, also support RAPs in the developed world and encourage the transfer of
research and technology to iRAP. In addition, many individuals donate their time and expertise to support
iRAP. iRAP is a member of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration.
The main objective of the RAP method is the improvement of the road users’ safety by proposing cost-
effective investment plans. The most crucial point of the RAP methodology is that engineers and planners in
developed countries have for over twenty years adopted an underlying philosophy of designing a forgiving
road system to minimize the chances of injuries when road users make mistakes that result in crashes. The
method indicates that the severity of a road accident can be reduced through the intervention at the
sequence of events happening during this accident. As it is known, an injury accident results from a chain of
events, starting with an initial event, probably resulting from several factors, which leads to a dangerous
situation. The basic idea is to intervene at any point of this chain, in order to reduce the kinetic energy of all
road users involved in the accident to a tolerable level. Such an intervention may not only reduce the number
of accidents, but also the severity of injuries.
The initial step for the implementation of the RAP method is the inspection and record of the infrastructure
elements of a road network, which relate to the road safety. The record leads to the quantification of the
safety provided by a road section to its users by awarding safety scores (Star Rating Scores). The Star
Rating Scores express the safety capacity of a road section in a 5-Star scale. This quantification aims at
identifying the most appropriate countermeasures, which will increase the infrastructure’s road safety score.
The Safer Roads Investment Plan (SRIP) includes all the countermeasures proved able to provide the
greater safety capacity and maximize the benefit over spent cost of the planned investments. Thus, the
SRIPs are considered as a valuable tool for the authorities, stakeholders and investors in order to decide for
the most cost-effective and efficient road infrastructure investments.

1.6.1 Measuring the road infrastructure safety

The assessment of the road safety requires Road Safety Inspections of the road network sections and the
assignment of a safety score to them. The inspection is conducted by visual observation and recording of the
road infrastructure elements which are related - directly or not - to road safety and have a proven influence
on the likelihood of an accident or its severity. The RAP uses two types of inspection: drive-through and
video-based inspection. During the first one, recording of the infrastructure’s elements is performed manually,
with the help of the specialized software, while during the second type of inspection, a specially equipped
vehicle is used, so that the recorded video could be used for a virtual drive-through of the network and an
automated identification of the infrastructure’s elements.
Following the survey, the Road Protection Score (RPS) is calculated. The RPS is a unit-less indicator, which
depicts the infrastructure’s safety capacity for each road user type and it is calculated for 100m road
segments. Road user types include the following vulnerable road users: car occupants, motorcyclists,
bicyclists and pedestrians, who may be involved in road accidents. The respective RPS is calculated for
each road user type and each of the 100m road segmentation, in the following way:
                      RPSn,u= RPSn,u,c= Ln,u,c * Sn,u,c * OSn,u,c * EFIn,u,c * MTn,u,c
                                c            c


where “n? is the number of 100m road segment, “u? the type of road user and “c? the crash type that the road
user type “u? may be involved in. The following variables are taken into consideration: L: Likelihood that the “i?
crash may be initiated, S: Severity of the “i? crash, OS: Degree to which risk changes with the Operating
Speed for the specific “i? crash type, EFL: Degree to which a person’s risk of being involved in the “i? type of
crash is a function of another person’s use of the road (External Flow Influence), MT: Potential that an errant
vehicle will cross a median (Median Traversability).


1.6.2 The Star Rating process

The aim of the Star Rating process is awarding the “n? 100m road segments with Stars, depicting the safety
offered to each of the “u? road user types. The Star Rating system uses the typical international practice of
recognising the best performing category as 5-star and the worst as 1-star (5-star scale), so that a 5-star
road means that the probability of a crash occurrence, which may lead to death or serious injury, is very low.
The Star Rate is determined by assigning each RPS calculated to the Star Rating bands. The thresholds of
each band are different for each road user and were set following the significant sensitivity testing to
determine how RPS varies with changes in road infrastructure elements. The assignment procedure leads to
the development of a risk-worm chart, which depicts the variation of the RPS score in relation to the position
(distance from the beginning) of the road under consideration. The final output of the Star Rating is the Star
Rating Maps, in which the “n? road sections are shown with different colour, depending on their Star award
(5-star green and 1-star black).


1.6.3 Developing the Safer Roads Investment Plans (SRIPs)

The development of the most appropriate SRIP presupposes the assessment of the number of fatalities and
serious injuries that could be prevented for each 100m road segment, on an annual basis, if a set of
countermeasures is applied. The number of fatalities is calculated as follows:
                                           Fn=    F    n,u,c

                                                 u   c


where “n? is the number of the 100m road segment, “u? the type of road user, “c? the crash type that the road
user “u? may be involved in and F the number of fatalities that can be prevented in a time period of 20 years,
given that a specific set of countermeasures is applied.
The number is related to four main factors: (1) the safety score of the specific road segment, (2) the “u? road
users flow, (3) the fatality growth, which indicates the underlying trend in road fatalities and (4) the calibration


                                                                          iRAP Egypt Technical Report, 2014 | 8
factor, which inserts the actual number of fatalities that occur on the specific road section. The calculation of
this factor presupposes the existence of similar crash data.
The assessment of the number of serious injuries that could be prevented in a 100m road segment is the
function of the Fn,u,c value and the ratio of the actual number of serious injuries to the actual number of
fatalities to the relevant number of fatalities. In case the appropriate data are missing, the competent
authorities should estimate this actual number as previously, or the ratio of 10 serious injuries to 1 death is
used, which is proposed by McMahon and Dahdah (2008)2.
The next step in establishing the SRIPs is the identification of the most appropriate countermeasures.
Countermeasures are the engineering improvements that the road authorities should take in order to reduce
the rate of fatalities and serious injuries. Each countermeasure is characterized by its trigger sets and its
effectiveness for each of the 100m road segments. Each trigger set describes all the cases in which this
certain countermeasure can be used. The effectiveness is calculated according to the number of fatalities
and serious injuries that can be prevented in this segment and the RPS of this segment before and after the
application of the countermeasure. It is important to mention that in the case that multiple countermeasures
act on a certain road segment, the total effectiveness is not the simple sum of each countermeasure’s
effectiveness. Instead, a reduction factor should act, which calibrates the total effectiveness.
The procedure of selecting the most appropriate countermeasures is the basis for the techno-economic
analysis of the investment plan, with the aim of calculating the Benefit-Cost ratio (BCR) for each
countermeasure. The economic benefit is considered as the benefit of preventing a death or a serious injury.
The calculations are conducted following the assumption that the cost of a human life is 70 times the GDP
per capita, the cost of a serious injury is the 25% of the cost of a human life and the ratio of 10 serious
injuries for 1 death, if more accurate information is not available. The countermeasure cost includes all the
construction costs, the maintenance costs over a 20 year period and/or probable reconstruction costs. All the
benefits/costs should reflect the actual local prices, taking into account the economic life of each
countermeasure and the discount rate. The outcome of this procedure is the BCR calculation for each
countermeasure applied to a specific road segment.
The SRIP is conducted for a period of 20 years and shows the list of the most cost effective improvements
that are able to reduce the crash risk for all road user types. In that way the SRIP enables the road
authorities to set the priorities properly when developing infrastructure‘s maintenance and/or rehabilitation
plans.

2 Road network
The roads inspected are managed by the General Authority of Roads, Bridges and Land Transport
(GARBLT). There are 13 road sections inspected, which are shown in Figure 5. The surveyed network is
2,139 km long, but as some divided roads are surveyed in both directions, the survey length is 3,273
carriageway kilometres.
The road network inspected includes the majority of the 10% of the roads in Egypt that carry the highest
volume and have frequent high severity crashes per km per year. Security concerns meant that the survey
was shortened from that originally contemplated to the network shown in Figure 5.

3 Data Collection
3.1 Road Survey




Figure 6        The survey vehicle
The iRAP Egypt road survey commenced in February 2014 and was undertaken by the Australian Road
Research Board (ARRB) working with the Indian Road Safety Survey and Management pvt Ltd using a
digital imaging system, imported from Australia and fitted onto a local vehicle. The survey team collected a
detailed panoramic view of more than 3,200 carriageway kilometres of the Egypt road network.
The survey was carried out using the Hawkeye 2000 digital imaging system with three high resolution
cameras (1280 x 960 pixels), manufactured by the ARRB Group. Together, the three cameras recorded a
panoramic view of the road and roadside verges in front of the vehicle. The image was sufficiently wide to
identify intersections, roadside usage and also roadside hazards. These images were collected every 10
metres of travel.
A roof rack which arrived with the equipment was fitted onto the vehicle and the cameras attached, whilst the
cabling from the cameras to the rack were routed through the window. A specialised mounting bracket for
the distance measuring device was also attached to the vehicle, at the rear wheel arch.
The cameras were also calibrated to allow the measurement of particular features of the road, such as lane
and shoulder widths and distance to road side hazards which are important components in the safety
assessment of the road.
The stakeholders’ logos were put on the vehicle, which was demonstrated at the official project launch.

3.2 Coding the data
After the completion of the road inspection phase, the process of coding of video material took place.
The coding of the roads listed in Table 4 was undertaken by the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB), in
association with the Indian Road Survey Management (IRSM).
The coding of the recorded video material was carried out on the basis of the iRAP Star Rating Coding
Manual. The coding manual is of version 3 RAP-SR-2.2 Star Rating coding manual. The coding task was
completed by 6 coders.
The coding staff used the Hawkeye 2000 software to rate some 30 road infrastructure features at 100 metre
intervals along the road.
The features coded by the team include:
1. Carriageway label
2. Upgrade cost
3. Motorcycle flow observed
4. Bicycle flow observed
5. Pedestrian flow observed across the road
6. Pedestrian flow observed along the road
7. Land use
8. Area type
9. Speed limits
10. Median type
11. Roadside severity – objects
12. Roadside severity – distance
13. Paved shoulder
14. Intersection type, quality and volume
15. Property access points
16. Number of lanes
17. Lane width
18. Curvature
19. Quality of curve
20. Grade
21. Road condition
22. Skid resistance/grip
23. Delineation
24. Street lighting
25. Pedestrian crossing facilities, quality
26. Speed management/traffic calming
27. Vehicle parking
28. Sidewalk provision
29. Facilities for motorcycles
30. Facilities for bicycles



                                                                    iRAP Egypt Technical Report, 2014 | 20
More details on the features coded are available in the iRAP Inspection Manual.

It is highly significant that the results of the coding work be of good quality. In order to achieve that, the
following actions must be undertaken:
       Before the coding, all the members of the coding team sit together, code a short section together
        and have a discussion in order to make sure everybody’s feeling on the coding item is consistent.
       During the coding, each specific situation is recorded and given special attention and discussion.

       After the coding, the results of the coders are checked at random. References of important attributes
        are checked on the Google Earth satellite image.
The quality assurance process was the next important phase of the coding process and assessed whether
the road attributes captured in the road inspection had been coded correctly.
The Quality Assurance of the specific dataset was performed by the Serbian AMSS-CMV which is an
accredited iRAP supplier.

3.3 Traffic volumes
Traffic volume data are used in the iRAP model as a multiplier for the estimation of the number of deaths and
serious injuries that could be prevented on the roads.
Traffic volume data for the Egypt road assessment program have been collected by the GARBLT staff.
Following the results of the traffic flow data collection, the sections identified as having the highest traffic
volumes are shown in Table.

3.4 Pedestrian and bicycle volume
The ViDA model also requires the inputs on four types of flows for each 100m section of the surveyed
network:


         Pedestrian peak hour flow across the road
         Pedestrian peak hour flow along the driver-side
         Pedestrian peak hour flow along the passenger-side
         Bicyclist peak hour flow along the road

These types of data are difficult to obtain as there are no relevant measurements. To overcome this issue,
appropriate estimations were made using the RAP pre-processor tool. This tool estimates the pedestrians
and bicyclists flows based on the coded attributes such as Land use, Area type, Pedestrian crossing
facilities, Sidewalk provision, etc.
The basic flows and the multiplier matrix for various land use along the road are displayed in the following
Figures. Precise measures of bicycle and pedestrian flow are unavailable in Egypt but the matrices provide
estimates of relative activity and GARBLT engineers were consulted for details of local variation on this.

Because of the lack of adequate sidewalks and pedestrian facilities to cross the road, pedestrians are not
physically separated from traffic, but walk together with vehicles, which is particularly dangerous for children
and older pedestrians.

3.5 Operating speed
Speed management is a critical aspect of managing a safe road system. The risk of death or serious injury is
minimised in any crash, where:

         vulnerable road users (e.g. motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians) are physically separated from
          cars and heavier vehicles, or traffic speeds are 40km/h or less
         opposing traffic is physically separated and roadside hazards are well managed
         traffic speeds are 70km/h or less for occupants of cars on roads where opposing traffic is not
          physically separated or roadside hazards exist

The main issue which has emerged from inspections in iRAP’s pilot countries is how to deal with
discrepancies between permitted (posted) speeds and the speeds at which drivers generally drive. In some
locations, for example, posted speed limits are set at very low speeds that are unlikely to be achieved
without continuous enforcement or robust traffic calming measures.The level of risk of death or serious injury
on a road is highly dependent on the speed at which traffic travels. iRAP policy is that risk assessments are
made using the ‘operating speed’ on a road. Operating speed is defined as being the greater of the
legislated speed limit or the measured 85th percentile speed.

Nevertheless, speed data are not usually available for each individual road or section at frequent intervals
and, in the absence of detailed information, it is necessary to make assumptions about general speeds on
the network, based on the available data and local knowledge. Many EuroRAP and iRAP speed surveys
have found out that it is not uncommon for 85th percentile speeds to exceed the speed limit by 10-20 km/h
over the range of speeds. In the technical working group meetings in May 2014 it was agreed that it should
be assumed that the 85th percentile operating speed exceeded the posted speed limit by 20km/h.

3.6 Crash data
All deaths in Egypt are reported to the health system and a death certificate is completed for all deaths. This
information is fed into the mortality information system and analysed at the national information centre.
Limited information is available on road injuries and deaths. On the more severe crashes, details such as
location and time, basic details of vehicles, casualties and contributory factors are available. These figures
have shown inconsistencies in coverage and reporting. It is noticeable that during recent periods of civil
unrest there has been gross under-reporting.
For the year 2008 (the most recent for which reliable data are available), 340 deaths have been reported on
the surveyed network. An underreporting of 50% has been assumed and therefore a true number of road
deaths of 510. This estimate is supported by GARBLT. GARBLT was not able to supply data disaggregated
by casualty class but, reflecting the character of the network, the following disaggregation of fatalities has
been assumed: vehicle occupants (306), motorcyclists (51, although subsequently not modelled fully due to
insufficient information about their distribution on the network3), pedestrians (127.5) and bicyclists (25.5). It
is assumed that generally there are 10 serious casualties to 1 fatal. The iRAP methodology assumes that for
the purposes of calibration, two-thirds of vehicle occupant and motorcyclist casualties may respond to
infrastructure countermeasures.

3.7 Countermeasure costs
The iRAP model requires inputs concerning local construction and maintenance costs for the 70
countermeasures that are considered when developing the Safer Roads Investment Plans. The costs are
categorised by area type (urban, semi-urban and rural) and upper and lower costs (low, medium and high).
The countermeasure cost estimates used in this study are attached in Appendix 2. In the absence of suitable
countermeasure costs for Egypt, it was agreed that costs based on those from Yemen with an appropriate
GDP adjustment factor should be used. 2014 GDP per capita at current prices is 3,333 USD (Egypt) and
1,572 USD (Yemen). A GDP/capita-related uplift of 1.67 has been made on the Yemen values, this
reflecting the fact that not all costs within the countermeasures can be related to GDP factors such as labour
costs.

3.8 Economic data
RAP uses a standard approach globally to estimate the economic cost of deaths and serious injuries. The
economic data were collected from the IMF and other websites in the prescribed manner.

As was discussed in Section 3.2 of this report, the rating team assessed the condition of more than 30 road
infrastructure elements, at 100 metre intervals throughout the network. This assessment shows that the
network is mainly a dual carriageway (77%) with undivided (23%) lanes traversing mainly rural/open areas
(98%).
Throughout the network, lanes are wider than 3.25 metres (100%). Shoulders are paved (67%) and sealed
and are 1.0 to 2.4 m wide (medium), on the passenger’s side (51%).
Many of the roads traverse desert terrain, which is reflected by the fact that (89%) of the roads have straight
or gently curves. Forty percent (40%) of the road length has safe roadsides (right side), whereas the majority
of the road network length has unprotected fixed objects close to the travelling lanes.
The most common type of intersections are formal median crossing points and merge lanes.
The maximum posted speed limits are mostly 90/100km/h (84%), whereas the speed of the remaining roads
is generally posted at 60km/h.
As for the pedestrian facilities, they do not exist in 99% of the inspected roads, i.e. there is a very small
number of signalized pedestrian crossings, with or without traffic lights, refuges and grade separated
facilities. The same goes for bicyclist facilities.
When it comes to hazardous objects, at the side of a driver or passenger at the front seat, such objects are
recorded in about 60% of the surveyed road network. These objects include poles of a diameter greater than
10cm, unprotected barrier ends, steep slopes and trees, etc.
Filtering of the data to identify known crash situations and circumstances demonstrates under-provision of
protection and for particular road-users (see Figure 16a).

5 Road safety assessment results
Based on the analysis of the coded survey data and safety indicators, i.e. background data, the roads are
star rated for safety using iRAP methodology. Star ratings are given for vulnerable road user categories:
vehicle occupants, motorcyclists, pedestrians and bicyclists.


5.1 Overall Star Ratings Results
The overall Star Ratings for the road sections assessed are shown below in Table 14. 1-star roads are those
with the highest risk and 5-star roads have the least risk.

The results show that no road on the 3,273km long surveyed network was awarded 5 stars for vehicle
occupants. Only 6% of the roads scored 4 stars for the car occupant safety. 40% of the network was
awarded 3 stars, while 54% of the roads scored only 1 star or 2 stars.
The network was rated less well for motorcyclists, with only 23% achieving a 3-star rating.
Road sections for other vulnerable road users rated even worse, only 2% of the network achieving a 3-star
or better rating for pedestrians and 1% for bicyclists, the remainder either 1-star or 2-star.
The Star Rating results from the table above are also shown on the maps below.

5.2 Egypt compared with other countries
It is noticeable that the percentage distribution of vehicle occupant star ratings in Egypt is not dissimilar to
Brazil, India and Russia.
Ratings will depend on the network that is inspected and how that network is defined, so if, for example, the
network that is inspected has a relatively high proportion of dual carriageway, there is likely to be a higher
proportion of higher stars. Correspondingly, if a national network includes a high proportion of single
carriageway roads, then it will have a higher proportion of 1- or 2-star roads than would otherwise be the
case. Similarly if only part of a network is inspected, it may not be possible to make a realistic comparison of
the standard of that overall network with another country.
Egypt (18%) has a similar percentage of 1-star to Russia, India and Brazil (19-21%) but is better that Yemen
(31%). 46% of the Egypt network is rated 3-star of above, again similar to Russia (41%), India (48%) and
Brazil (51%). Yemen has 47%.

5.3 Detailed Star Ratings Results
Some road sections have been selected in the text below to demonstrate the Star Rating results in detail,
and to explain the reasons behind the overall poor rating. They illustrate the scores for vehicle occupants.
The low score in the figures below indicates a relatively low level of risk while a high score indicates a
relatively high level of risk.


5.3.1 Road 25_195 (Aswan – Abu Simbel), the tourist route
This particular section starts at the town of Aswan and goes to Abu Simbel, the famous tourist site. The main
terrain of this section is a desert. It is a single carriageway road whose total length is about 261 km. The
operating speed of the desert section is significantly higher than the speed limit. The traffic flow on this
section is approximately 1,000 - 5,000 vehicles per day. Median type on the whole section is the central line
only, number of lanes is one and lane width is mainly over 3.25 m.

The Star Rating results for this particular road are quite good. Almost 80% of the section is rated as 3-star,
15% is rated as 2-star and only 2% is rated as 1-star for vehicle occupants. To illustrate the risk distribution
along the road, a specific ViDA tool can be used – the Risk Worm. The Risk Worm helps identify quickly the
locations of high risk. The “spikes? in the graph usually relate to intersections, sharp curves, or similar single
factors which increase the risk significantly.

Looking at the statistics of the coded attributes along this section, the reason for the overall good safety
rating can be identified. The whole section was coded as a good road condition and almost 80% of the
section was coded as having an adequate delineation. The road side severity distance on both sides of the
road is over 10m, on almost 70% of the section. Likewise, on almost 65% of both sides of the section, no
dangerous objects have been recorded within 10m.
One of the locations with high risk distribution is shown on the pictures below.

5.3.2 Road 21 (Cairo – Alexandria), the agricultural route
This section starts at Cairo and ends in Alexandria. The main terrain of this section is agricultural. It is a dual
carriageway road, of a total length of about 180 km. The traffic flow on this section is very high –
approximately 60% of the section has the flow of 20,000 - 40,000 vehicles per day. Median type on 70% of
the section is concrete barrier, number of lanes is two or three and lane width is mainly over 3,25 m.

As seen on the above table, the Star Rating results of this particular road are quite poor. More than a half
(64%) of the section scored 1-star for vehicle occupants’ safety. The results for the pedestrians and bicyclists
are almost the same as for vehicle occupants, i.e. almost 80% of the section scored 1-star. To illustrate the
risk distribution along the road, a specific ViDA tool can be used – the Risk Worm.

6 Safer Roads Investment Plan
6.1 Overview of the method
The making of a SRIP is preceded by the following actions, as summarized below.


6.1.1 Estimating the number of deaths and serious injuries

To enable economic evaluation of various countermeasure options, an estimate of the number of deaths and
serious injuries under existing conditions on each 100 m section of road was made. As discussed earlier, it is
estimated that 317 deaths occur each year on the surveyed roads in Egypt. Since the number of deaths was
available only in aggregate form the deaths and serious injuries needed to be distributed among the 100m
sections of road, the number distributed to each section was a function of the product of each section’s Star
Rating Score and exposure (in the case of vehicle occupants, exposure is measured as the annual average
daily traffic). Hence, it is feasible that a road with a 1-star rating (indicating high risk) can still experience very
few deaths if its traffic volume is low, and vice versa.


6.1.2 Selecting countermeasures

For each 100m section of road, a series of countermeasures that could be feasibly implemented were
identified. This was achieved by considering each countermeasure’s ability to reduce risk (using a series of
‘triggers’) and ‘hierarchy’ rules.
The following are examples of triggers:
    A section of road that has a poor pedestrian Star Rating Score and high pedestrian activity would
         ‘trigger’ installation of a pedestrian refuge, pedestrian crossing or signalised pedestrian crossing.
    A section of road with poor delineation and a high vehicle occupant Star Rating Score would ‘trigger’
         delineation improvements.
‘Hierarchy’ rules were used to ensure that more comprehensive countermeasures ‘override’ less
comprehensive countermeasures. For example:
     If a grade separated pedestrian facility was feasible, then it took precedent over other pedestrian
        measures (such as a pedestrian refuge or signalised crossing).
     If a horizontal realignment was feasible, then redundant countermeasures were not considered (for
        example, curve delineation and shoulder widening).
     If a segregated motorcycle lane was feasible, then other motorcycle lanes (such as an on-road
        motorcycle lane) were removed from the plan.


6.1.3 Economic analysis

Each countermeasure option identified was then subject to a BCR (Benefit-Cost Ratio) analysis.
Countermeasures that failed to achieve a BCR that met a prescribed threshold for a given 100m segment
were excluded from the analysis. The benefit of a countermeasure was determined by calculating the net
present value of deaths and serious injuries that would be avoided over twenty years if the countermeasure
was installed (a discount rate of 12% was used). The reduction in deaths and serious injuries was
determined by replacing the Star Rating Score used in the original estimate (made in the process of
distributing deaths among 100 meter sections of road) with a new, lower Star Rating Score. The resultant
reductions were then reduced by 0.6, to account for the fact that the benefit of a package of
countermeasures is typically less than the sum of their individual benefits. The cost of a countermeasure was
determined by calculating the net present cost of constructing and replacing it (based on its service life) over
20 years.


                                                                            iRAP Egypt Technical Report, 2014 | 56
      6.2 Investment plan
      The basic output of the RAP method is the Safer Roads Investment Plan. The SRIP presents all the
      countermeasures that proved to be able to provide the greater safety capacity and maximize the benefit over
      spent cost of the planned investments. The cost of each countermeasure is compared to the value of life and
      serious injuries that could be saved. The Benefit to Cost Ratio (BCR) is calculated for each countermeasure
      proposed. It has to be mentioned that the countermeasures listed are indicative and will need to be assessed
      and sense-checked with local engineers. Note that not all measures will be relevant to all Egypt situations.
      Where, for example, a measure may be considered inappropriate, alternatives may be found – for example if
      roadside barriers are not well suited to a location, then road hazard clearance should be considered.
      Data are held in iRAP’s ViDA software. In circumstances where the printed output differs from that held in
      ViDA, the material held within the software takes precedence. The printed report provides the results of the
      survey and also gives an entry-level guide to the software and the analysis possibilities that are available
      within it. Any changes in the modelling assumptions, coding corrections, minor model changes or
      differences in the presentation of results (such as rounding) will always be reflected in results held in the
      ViDA software.

According to the investment plan, the total cost of the engineering measures is 1,809m EGP, while the
present value of safety benefits amounts to 7,130m EGP. If the SRIP is implemented, the estimated number
of FSI saved will be 37,030 in the next 20 years, i.e. 48,855 EGP per FSI saved. The programme BCR is 4.
The top five most efficient and cost-effective measures that could help save the greatest number of lives
include the following identified solutions: Improved delineation, Roadside barriers – driver side, Roadside
barriers – passenger side, Protected turn lanes, Footpath provision passenger side (adjc. to road).
The Star Rating results after adopting all the proposed countermeasures are presented in the next figures.

It is clear that the SRIP would improve the Egypt road network safety significantly. For vehicle occupants, the
number of 1-Star high-risk roads would decrease to a great extent, whereas the 5-Star roads would be
present in 16% of the network. Practically all road network will be minimum 3-star. There are improvements
in the bicycles and pedestrians’ safety as well. However, the effect of the SRIP on these user groups is
relatively lower than on vehicle occupants.

6.3 Implementation of Countermeasures
If the recommended countermeasures have been implemented, the predicted casualty reduction map with
the reduced FSI over 20 years will be as follows:

This map illustrates the numbers of fatalities and serious injuries that could be prevented per kilometre, per
year, if the countermeasures identified in the Safer Roads Investment Plan (SRIP) were implemented.
The SRIP contains extensive planning and engineering information such as road attribute records,
countermeasure proposals and economic assessments for 100 meter sections of road network. They are
supported by the online software which makes this information highly accessible. Each countermeasure
proposed in a SRIP is backed by strong evidence. If implemented, it will prevent deaths and serious injuries
in a cost-effective way. Nevertheless, in interpreting the results of this report, it is important to recognize that
iRAP method is designed to provide a network-level assessment of risk and cost-effective countermeasures.
As such, a SRIP should be considered just the first step in building a safe road. For this reason,
implementation of the proposals in subsequent steps of this project will be subject to:
     Local examination of proposed countermeasure options.
     Preliminary and detailed design for trunk roads, Star Ratings of the designs, detailed costing, final
        economic evaluation.
     Identification of ‘rural road’ priorities, preliminary design, costing and economic analysis of
        countermeasures.
This will be accompanied by preliminary project design, scope and cost estimates for the capacity building
and road safety education campaigns.


6.3.1 Tailoring a SRIP for a specific section of road
Having identified a priority location or a section of road, it is possible to further tailor the countermeasure plan
to suit specific circumstances. This is especially useful if budget constraints have changed. Cost-
effectiveness may be used to generate a list of priority countermeasures within a limited budget. The initial
SRIP involved production of list of all countermeasures that could feasibly be built on the road, sorted in
order of descending BCR. The countermeasure download file, available online, was used to generate this list.


6.4 Detailed SRIP Results

6.4.1 Road 21 (Cairo – Alexandria), the agricultural route
The table below shows the tailored SRIP for the section 21, presented in chapter 5.22, with the priority top
10 countermeasures for this section, in terms of saved FSIs. The most efficient and cost-effective proposed
countermeasure is the provision of passenger footpath (adjacent to road) and roadside barriers for the
passenger and driver’s side.

It is clear that the SRIP would improve the Egypt road network safety significantly. For vehicle occupants, the
number of 1 and 2 Star high-risk roads would decrease significantly, whereas the 5-Star roads would be
present in 37% of the network. Practically all the road network will be minimum 3-star. There are
improvements in the bicycles and pedestrians’ safety, too. However, the effect of the SRIP on these user
groups is relatively lower than it is on the vehicle occupant user group.

7 Safer road system
Although the plans summarized in the previous section identify opportunities to significantly reduce deaths
and serious injuries, in order to ensure that these benefits are realized, and that road safety is truly
addressed and tackled, efforts that go beyond engineering improvements alone will be necessary. Egypt is
one of many regions in which traffic education and enforcement (seat belts, helmets, drink-driving, mobile
phone use, etc) is still developing. As a result, the benefit of some infrastructure improvements may be
compromised because they are not used as they are intended. For example, during the project it was noted
that there were many unsafe human behaviours, such as children playing on the roads, pedestrians not
using crossing facilities, vehicles parking at inappropriate locations, etc. Even some road infrastructure was
destroyed or stolen, which could pose a potential safety hazard.
In order to achieve a safer road system, in terms of safer roads and mobility, all the stakeholders from the
project must ensure that, after the iRAP assessment of the existing infrastructure has been completed, the
proposed engineering countermeasure must be implemented in order to separate road users and thus
protect the vulnerable road users from road crashes.

8 Future action
   8.1 Maintenance, crash reduction measures and upgrading
Countermeasures in the SRIP can often be implemented as part of one or more existing programmes
targeting maintenance, crash reduction or large-scale upgrading.
Elements in the SRIP in Table 17 in a maintenance budget might include such features as delineation,
resurfacing or shoulder sealing, all of which are items that are modestly priced and yet can have a
substantial influence on crash reduction.
Crash studies often highlight collisions at particular locations, types of locations or those involving particular
road users. As such, a programme of countermeasures prompted by the SRIP and informed by
complementary local information might include implementing protected turns at intersections, providing
refuge islands or upgrading an intersection by installing traffic signals.
Upgrading or road rehabilitation may include creating more road space by adding a lane, installing barriers to
enhance crash protection or providing grade separation. These are large-scale investments often
contemplated over longer time scales and as part of bigger programmes.

8.1 Mass action
Mass action programmes aim to rectify problems of a particular type on an area wide basis by applying a
proven low cost remedy to locations or routes having common accident factor 4 . Typically the
countermeasures included in a mass action programme would be something easy to conduct, such as line
marking, signs, shoulder sealing, surface improvements and cross traffic turn lanes at intersections.
The SRIPs in this report provides a basis for developing a mass action programme.
Analysis in Table 17 showed that street lighting improvements at 7 intersections was identified (helping to
prevent 120 deaths and serious injuries over 20 years at a cost of about EGP 15.6m and with a BCR of 2).
Two such locations of street lighting are illustrated in the ViDA screenshot below (Figure 53) as an example.
Delineation and signing at intersections is another popular measure. 98 sites have been identified where
there would be a saving of 950 fatal and serious casualties at a cost of about EGP 48m and a BCR of 4.
Similarly, 62.4km is recommended for a passenger side roadside hazard clearance, saving more than 50
fatal and serious injuries over 20 years and at a cost of around EGP 10m. The benefit cost ratio shows that
the measure pays for itself.
Mass action programme opportunities may be used in improving curve delineation, shoulder rumble strips,
protected turns, roadside hazard reduction or pedestrian refuges.

8.1 Perform a demonstration project
It is unlikely even the best-funded road authority would be able to implement a full Safer Roads Investment
Plan. Some authorities choose to set a higher threshold BCR and then implement selectively; others choose
to select only a small part of the network where there will be greatest casualty savings and direct resources
at that.
Figure 39 and Figures 44-45 show potential for action on the Cairo-Alexandria Agricultural Road. The
associated images show a need, in particular to reinforce the urban spread into the carriageway and provide
for vulnerable road users. The figures below show where, in other countries, simple measures have been
used to demarcate the carriageway and provide for different road users. Examples such as these could be
used on the Cairo-Alexandria route.
The Cairo-Alexandria route has the twin advantages of offering good potential for casualty reduction and
being close to centre of population. The latter point is important because it is important to select such
demonstration projects in places where they will be readily visible to those with influence who may create
opportunities for them to be copied elsewhere.

   8.2 Engagement with the data and the Egypt road safety community
This iRAP survey provides several opportunities for GARBLT. It is recommended in particular:

       that GARBLT engineers skilled in the use of the iRAP ViDA package continue to skill up other
        GARBLT staff in its use. In the absence of good alternative information, the inventory and risk data
        base is hugely powerful

       that funds are sought for continued implementation support in Egypt over the coming year and
        potentially beyond. This would take the form of of missions from iRAP-nominated personnel familiar
        with ViDA data and able to provide support work for tender documents for road upgrading

       that there is a larger-scale workshop that includes GARBLT maintenance and design engineers as
        well as local consultant engineers. This will facilitate priority-setting based on the EuroRAP and a
        wider shared understanding of what is possible

       that the iRAP study in Egypt is the focus of a conference in Egypt or presentations beyond Egypt by
        GARBLT staff, thereby increasing their ownership and dissemination of the work

       that a database is developed of the wider road safety and engineering community in Egypt who may
        wish to receive copies of the report and indeed have access to the data




                                                                       iRAP Egypt Technical Report, 2014 | 74
9 Conclusions
This technical report describes the road assessment project in Egypt and includes details on data collection,
methodology used and a summary of results in a form of Star Ratings, showing the level of risk on the road
network. It also offers Safer Roads Investment Plans which have enormous potential to reduce road deaths
and injuries on the inspected roads. iRAP results are available to the project stakeholders who can learn
about precise locations where countermeasures should be considered for implementation.
The star rating showed that no road was rated as 5-star for vehicle occupants. Only 6% of the roads scored
4 stars for the car occupant safety. 40% of the network was awarded 3 stars, while 54% of the roads scored
only 1 star or 2 stars.
The network was rated less well for motorcyclists, with only 23% achieving a 3-star rating.
Road sections for other vulnerable road users rated even worse. Only 2% of the network achieved a 3-star
or better rating for pedestrians and 1% for bicyclists. 5% of the network scored better than 1-star for
pedestrians and 7% for bicyclists.
Sources of deaths or serious injuries on the inspected network are likely to include:
            lack of run-off protection and hazardous objects close to the road
            inadequate intersection layout, control and marking
            lack of head-on protection
            lack of pedestrian facilities
Although the quality of Egypt’s roads is not inconsistent with other middle-income countries, more effort
should be put into providing safer infrastructure for all road users. The most efficient and cost-effective
countermeasures include improved delineation, roadside barriers on both driver and passenger side,
protected turn lanes, footpath provision adjacent to road etc.
The results showed that the current state of roads needs improvements in order to achieve the desired level
of safety, and to climb higher in the international rating of safety level on roads.
The outputs of this work give support to the decision-makers as well as engineers in the process of
identifying the areas of high risk, and help them decide how to address these locations. The methodology of
measuring the relative risk of various types of accidents based on coded attributes and collected data about
the traffic flow proved to be effective in many countries of the world in the framework of the RAP programme.
The Safer Roads Investment Plan is not a “bill of works? that may used directly intender documents. It and
the assumptions used in the model must be carefully assessed by local engineers and others who have
contributed to the work or who have a legitimate interest in the roads. In particular, they must consider such
features as the value of life and injury used in the work, the data used in estimating injury savings, traffic
volumes, countermeasure costs and operating speeds on the network.
A programme budgeted at 1,809m EGP could save an estimated 37,000 fatal and serious injuries over 20
years, a reduction of around half of all casualties. The programme BCR would be 4, with many
countermeasures of course providing a much higher rate of return than this.
Future action on in Egypt could:
           include selective implementation of the SRIP based on targets of improving maintenance, using
            complementary crash studies, network upgrading
           be driven by a mass action philosophy designed to counter particular crash types at common
            locations or for particular road users
           include a demonstration project on the Cairo-Alexandria Agricultural Road
           make further use of the data and sharing of it with the wider road safety community in Egypt

12 Appendix 3: Countermeasure examples
Road Safety Toolkit

Countermeasures identified in iRAP plans are described in more detail on the Road Safety
Toolkit (http://toolkit.irap.org). The Toolkit provides free information on the causes and
prevention of road crashes that cause death and injury. It builds on decades of road safety
research, the Toolkit helps engineers, planners and policy makers develop safety plans for
car occupants, motorcyclists, pedestrians, bicyclists, heavy vehicle occupants and public
transport users.

The Road Safety Toolkit is the result of collaboration between the International Road
Assessment Programme (iRAP), the Global Transport Knowledge Partnership (gTKP) and the
World Bank Global Road Safety Facility. ARRB Group provided expert advice during the
Toolkit's development. Examples of measures listed in Table 17 are see in Figures 58-67.

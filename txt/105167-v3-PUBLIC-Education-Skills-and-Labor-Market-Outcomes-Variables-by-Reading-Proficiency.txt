Data Set 2 - Variables by Reading Proficiency
Each tab contains 52 variables that cover:
 - Skills acquisition history
 - Background conditions
 - Self-reported cognitive skills
 - Self-reported socio-emotional skills
 - Self-repored job-relvant skills
 - Labor market outcomes
All variables are organized by reading proficiency, as assessed by an extended reading assessment applied in eight out of the
Skills Measurement Household Survey in 2012 and 2013. The designer of this assessment, Educational Testing Services (ETS),

Most of the tasks at this level require the respondent to read relatively short digital or print continuous, noncontinuous or mixed t

this level require respondents to make matches between the text and information, and may require paraphrase or low-level infer
information may be present. Some tasks require the respondent to:
• cycle through or integrate two or more pieces of information based on criteria,
• compare and contrast or reason about information requested in the question, or
• navigate within digital texts to access and identify information from various parts of a document.

Literacy Level 3
Texts at this level are often dense or lengthy, including continuous, noncontinuous, mixed or multiple pages. Understanding text
central to successfully completing tasks, especially in navigation of complex digital texts. Tasks require the respondent to identif
of information and often require varying levels of inferencing. Many tasks require the respondent construct meaning across large
operations in order to identify and formulate responses. Often tasks also demand that the respondent disregard irrelevant or ina
accurately. Competing information is often present, but it is not more prominent than the correct information.

Literacy Level 4
Tasks at this level often require respondents to perform multiple-step operations to integrate, interpret, or synthesize information
noncontinuous, mixed, or multiple type texts. Complex inferences and application of background knowledge may be needed to p
identifying and understanding one or more specific, non-central ideas in the text in order to interpret or evaluate subtle evidence
relationships. Conditional information is frequently present in tasks at this level and must be taken into consideration by the resp
and sometimes seemingly as prominent as correct information.

Literacy Level 5
At this level, tasks may require the respondent to search for and integrate information across multiple, dense texts; construct sy
points of view; or evaluate evidence-based arguments. Application and evaluation of logical and conceptual models of ideas ma
Evaluating reliability of evidentiary sources and selecting key information is frequently a key requirement. Tasks often require re
cues and to make high-level inferences or use specialized background knowledge.

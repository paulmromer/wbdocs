Abstract
Large-scale government cash transfer programs have become an important element of social
protection and poverty reduction strategies throughout the developing world. Pakistan is no
exception; in 2008, Pakistan established the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) as an
unconditional cash transfer targeted at the poorest of the poor. The primary goal of the BISP program
is to provide the poorest households in Pakistan with unconditional transfers in order to improve their
consumption and investments in children. To attain this goal, it is believed important that the
transfers are provided directly to women to ensure the funds are spent as intended. Beyond changes
in consumption and investment, directing these transfers to women can also serve to empower
women by increasing household resources under their control. We analyze the impacts of Pakistan‚Äôs
BISP program on women‚Äôs decision-making power within households using data collected between
2011 and 2013 as the program was rolling out. Using fuzzy regression discontinuity methods to
statistically identify impacts, the BISP transfer is found to have substantial, positive impacts on some
variables measuring women‚Äôs decision-making power and empowerment.

            The Impacts of Cash Transfers on Women‚Äôs Empowerment:
                        Learning from Pakistan‚Äôs BISP Program


Starting with programs in Brazil (Lindert et al., 2007) and Progresa in Mexico (Levy, 2006),
large scale cash transfer programs have been established in many developing countries in the
last two decades to attempt to improve human capital outcomes among the poor. Recent
innovative program designs combined with rigorous impact evaluations have justified
programs to both donors and taxpayers, as benefits have become clear (Fiszbein and Schady,
2009). Conditional cash transfer programs have demonstrated strong positive impacts on
schooling in Latin America (e.g. Schultz, 2004; Attanasio et al., 2005; Schady and Araujo, 2008;
de Brauw and Gilligan, 2012); several programs have also reduced poverty headcounts and
poverty gaps (Fiszbein and Schady, 2009). As transfers are typically given to women, the
increase in the diet quality of food consumption in Mexico (Hoddinott, Skoufias, and
Washburn, 2000), Colombia (Attanasio and Mesnard, 2006), and Nicaragua (Maluccio and
Flores, 2005) led Schady and Rosero (2008) to hypothesize and indirectly test whether
women‚Äôs bargaining power increases when households receive cash transfers.
       Progresa as well as more recently designed programs have the improvement of
women‚Äôs empowerment as an explicit program goal (Doss, 2013). Women‚Äôs empowerment
can be defined as ‚Äúthe expansion in the ability to make strategic life choices in a context where
this ability was previously denied to them‚Äù (Kabeer, 2001). Yet this concept is difficult to
quantify, as it encompasses both decision making and the context in which those decisions
are made.
       In this paper, we study the impacts of Pakistan‚Äôs Benazir Income Support Program
(BISP) on measures related to women‚Äôs empowerment. As in many other cash transfer
programs, BISP transfers are distributed solely to women, with the broad goal of improving
women‚Äôs status within the household. We explicitly test whether outcomes beyond just
decision making are affected by the receipt of a BISP transfer, examining impacts on variables
related to gender norms, women‚Äôs mobility, and on the ability to vote. Whereas these



                                               1
variables do not totally encompass women‚Äôs empowerment, they go beyond the types of
questions often asked in evaluation surveys of social protection programs which largely
measure spheres of decision making (e.g. de Brauw et al., 2014; Bonilla et al., 2016).
Moreover, due to the survey design we are able to study both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs answers
to a subset of these questions.
       The BISP is a unique case in social protection for several reasons. First, it is an
unconditional transfer, similar to the types of transfers given in sub-Saharan Africa (Bonilla et
al., 2016). Whereas there is evidence that conditions matter for some outcomes (e.g.
schooling in Mexico; de Brauw and Hoddinott, 2011), more recent papers that have
randomized conditionality find that the conditions do not affect impacts on all outcomes (e.g.
Akresh et al., 2013), and moreover, the impacts of conditional cash transfers can depend on
the form of conditions (Baird et al., 2013).
       Second, the BISP is a nationwide program that has expanded quickly. Since 2011, the
BISP has been targeted using a proxy means test (PMT), which is used to attempt to reach 15
percent of households nationwide with regular, unconditional cash transfers. One of the
challenges in evaluating a large social program such as the BISP is the ability to credibly
identify impact estimates, as such programs are typically not randomized. Because BISP
beneficiaries are determined through the poverty score, there is a change in the probability
of receiving the BISP transfer at a pre-determined threshold. Therefore, we can use fuzzy
regression discontinuity design to identify causal impacts of the program at that threshold.
While the estimates are therefore theoretically unbiased, they should be interpreted as local
average treatment effects, local to the threshold and not as average impacts over all
beneficiaries.
       To meet the objective of the paper, we proceed as follows. First, we describe the
history of the BISP program and its primary objectives in more detail. Second, we describe
the literature on impacts of cash transfers on women‚Äôs empowerment. Third, we introduce
the data and fourth, we describe the estimation strategy and present evidence that the
methodology used should lead to low bias impact estimates for the local average treatment
effect. We present results in the fifth section, and the final section concludes.

   1. Program Background

       Cash transfers are somewhat rare in South Asia relative to East Asia and Latin America.
Whereas 70 and 60 percent of the poorest quintile in Latin America as East Asia receive cash
transfers, respectively, only 27 percent of the poorest quintile receive cash transfers in South
Asia (FAO, 2015). Pakistan is an exception; it first developed a Social Protection Strategy in
2007, and announced the BISP as its main social safety net program in 2008. The BISP initially
aimed to help the ‚Äúpoorest of the poor‚Äù through unconditional cash transfers. It has three
main policy goals. First, it aims to eradicate extreme and chronic poverty. Second, it aims to
empower women, and third, it aims to achieve universal primary education. The first goal is
meant to be achieved through regular cash transfers, and the second goal by specifically by
giving transfers to women. The government is attempting to meet the third goal through
other means.
       As the Pakistani (and the world) economy was characterized by high food price
inflation when the BISP began, there was some urgency to increase the declining purchasing
power among the poorest members of society. Consequentially, initial program targeting
took place through Parliamentarians, who were each asked to identify 8,000 beneficiary
households on a prescribed form, on which names, national ID card, and household income
information was collected. Under this system of targeting, the initial rollout led to
disbursement to over 2 million eligible families.
       As a result of concerns over the effectiveness and transparency of Parliamentarian
targeting, payments to beneficiaries were stopped and a new national targeting mechanism
based on a Proxy Means Test (PMT) was developed. Weights for the PMT were developed
using the 2007/8 Pakistan Living Standards Measurement Survey, and the PMT uses 23
variables to compile a poverty score. To target the BISP, a Poverty Scorecard survey was
initiated in 2010/11, collecting information on those 23 variables. Upon completion of data
collection, a PMT score was generated for every household. A PMT threshold (cut-off score)
of 16.17 was established to attempt to reach the targeted population, though a few
exceptions were also allowed. Households could appeal and receive transfers if their score



                                               3
was between 16.17 and 21.17 and there was either 1) at least one disabled member of the
household; 2) the presence of at least one senior citizens (65 years of age or older) and fewer
than three household members; or 3) The household includes 4 or more children under 12
years of age. All beneficiaries selected under the parliamentarian targeting system were also
recertified; those who had PMT scores above 16.17 and did not qualify for one of the four
exceptions were excluded from further benefits.
       To protect the poorest families, the BISP aims to deliver cash transfers to each ever-
married female in eligible households as identified by the PMT, subject to the females
possessing a valid Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC). Women have to register at
their local BISP office for the transfers, where their PMT score or poverty score is verified for
eligibility, and they become registered in the system for transfers. Some households include
as members more than one eligible woman; for the purposes of analysis, we count any
household with at least one eligible woman as a beneficiary household. During the period
under analysis for this paper (2011-2013), the benefit level is of PKR 1,000 per month, to be
paid in quarterly installments of PKR 3,000. Originally, the vast majority of beneficiaries were
paid through the Pakistan Post. However, following reports of misappropriation of funds,
other options were considered, and BISP began to replace payments through the Pakistan
Post with ATM cards (Benazir Debit Card, or BDC), which allow beneficiaries to collect money
directly from ATMs or Point-of-Sale (POS) machines. The transition from Pakistan Post
payments to ATM card payments began in 2012, and the majority (around 75 percent) of
beneficiaries that we identify in the administrative data were receiving payments through
ATM cards; some beneficiaries continue to receive payments through Pakistan Post because
they are quite geographically isolated, and ATM cards are issued through the local BISP office.


   2. Do Cash Transfers Affect Women‚Äôs Empowerment?

The notion that making women the direct recipients of cash transfers will improve their
influence in households‚Äô resource allocation decisions and will empower them in general is
at the heart of BISP. The notion that women should receive cash transfers derives from the



                                               4
original plan for Progresa/Oportunidades, which was designed under the working hypothesis
that by providing women with more external income, they would have a larger share of
overall household income, and therefore their agency within the household would increase
(Schultz, 2004). From a theoretical perspective, the transfers represent a change in the share
of income earned by each adult within the household, which lasts so long as the household
receives transfers; the changes are not expected to last beyond the receipt of the transfers.
           Yoong, Rabinovich, and Diepenveen (2012) systematically review the literature on the
relative efficacy of giving transfers to women; they suggest that although the bargaining
power of an individual within the household depends upon their income share, social norms
or a lack of formal legal rights can reduce the impact of making social protection payments
to women on their bargaining power. Making a similar argument, Handa et al. (2009) argue
that cash transfers could crowd out any intrahousehold transfers from men to women, rather
than working to increase women‚Äôs bargaining power within households. This argument is
consistent with evidence from the Progresa impact evaluation, which found that women
retain agency over the transfers, but little else within households (Attanasio and Lechene,
2002). 2
           Consequently, the literature on cash transfer programs shows mixed evidence on
impacts on women‚Äôs empowerment or decision making, if any (de la O Campos, 2015).
Whereas Attanasio and Lechene (2002) and Handa et al. (2009) both show little evidence of
quantitative impacts of Progresa on women‚Äôs empowerment, Adato et al. (2000) in
qualitative work on the same program find evidence of increased self-confidence and self-
esteem. Moreover, evaluations of cash transfer programs in other countries show positive
impacts. For example, de Brauw et al. (2014) find positive impacts of Bolsa Familia on some
spheres of women‚Äôs decision making power in Brazil. Ambler (2016) finds that the receipt of
the pension in South Africa increases the likelihood of women becoming the primary decision
maker in the household. The size of the transfer may be particularly important in the latter


2
 Moreover, if transfers end, unless women have made investments that increase their bargaining power their
share of income would drop, reducing their decision making power or other measures of women‚Äôs
empowerment.



                                                    5
case; as described by both Duflo (2003) and Ambler (2016), the pension represented a very
substantial increase in income for households in South Africa. In Pakistan, the BISP transfers
only represent 6 percent of household consumption expenditures, implying that the situation
might differ there.
        A major challenge in demonstrating that cash transfers have impacts on women‚Äôs
empowerment or decision making power is that these concepts are difficult to quantify.
Fortunately, the BISP evaluation data has several sets of indicators that relate to women‚Äôs
empowerment, and a set of questions about gender norms were asked both among men and
women. 3 As measures of empowerment, we use the full set of these questions as measures
of gender norms, the set of questions about female mobility reported by women, and a
separate question that was asked about female voting behavior. The indicators we study, and
their source in the questionnaire, can be found in Table 1.

    2.1. Women‚Äôs Status in Pakistan

Overall levels of women‚Äôs autonomy are generally low in South Asia (Jejeebhoy and Sathar,
2001). In Pakistan, however, South Asian norms combine with Islamic norms to give women
even less control over their lives; Jejeebhoy and Sathar (2001) show that women in Punjab,
Pakistan, have less mobility than women in Uttar Pradesh or Tamil Nadu in India. In describing
the gendered division of labor in Pakistan, Akram-Lodhi (1996) finds that women perceive
virtually no mobility rights outside of the village. Although Pakistan has fairly poor statistics
related to reproductive health (UNDP, 2013), Mumtaz and Salway (2005) caution that
mobility may not be linearly related to women‚Äôs reproductive health outcomes. Their
ethnographic study shows that if poor women are mobile it may reflect negatively on their
status, whereas richer women have more freedom to move around. Whereas Mumtaz and
Salway (2005) cannot establish a correlation between mobility and reproductive health
outcomes, in a nationally representative data set Hou and Ma (2013) find that women‚Äôs
decision-making power‚Äîa broader concept‚Äîis positively correlated with the use of

3
 In Pakistan, women and men would not sit together to respond to an interview, so they were interviewed
separately in each household in the data set about topics they would each be best placed to answer.



                                                    6
maternal health services in Pakistan, whereas men‚Äôs decision-making power is negatively
correlated with maternal health service use. These papers suggest that women‚Äôs
empowerment should not be studied in isolation, but alongside thoughts about how men
perceive women‚Äôs empowerment; and that in a relative sense women in particular lack status
in Pakistan.



   3. Data

For the impact evaluation, we use the combination of two data sources. The primary data
source are panel household data collected specifically for the evaluation of the BISP transfer.
Those data are combined with administrative records of both eligibility for payments and the
receipt of BISP payments, so that we are able to use administrative data on payments rather
than self-reports.

   3.1. Household Survey Data

We use the baseline and follow-up surveys conducted by Oxford Policy Management (OPM)
between April and July, 2011, and between April and July, 2013, respectively. The baseline
survey included households in the four target provinces (Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
or KPK, and Baluchistan), and the sample was chosen to be representative of households
close to the pre-determined poverty threshold of 16.17 in the four provinces. The evaluation
sample was created with the intention of exploiting the eligibility criterion (poverty score of
16.17 or less) to create a sample of ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù (households with poverty score just above
16.17) and ‚Äútreatment‚Äù (households with poverty score below 16.17). Thus the evaluation
sample has beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries as well as comparable non-beneficiaries.
       Ideally, the baseline survey for the impact evaluation would have taken place after
the BISP poverty census had taken place. However, the poverty census did not take place at
the same time in all of the evaluation provinces, and so payments took place in some districts
before the census was complete in others. As a result, in order to conduct the baseline survey
before payments were made to any beneficiaries, the survey was conducted while the BISP



                                              7
poverty census was still taking place. Consequently, a sampling scheme was required to
ensure that the baseline would include as many beneficiaries and valid controls as possible.
           The baseline sample was constructed as follows. 4 The sample frame was constructed
in four phases. First, primary sampling units (PSUs) or clusters within the 2007-8 Pakistan
Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) Survey were stratified at the provincial and
rural/urban level. Evaluation PSUs were then sampled directly from these strata using simple
random sampling. In phase 2, a household listing exercise was conducted in all evaluation
PSUs to form the basis of the sampling frame of households within evaluation PSUs. The
household listing exercise was conducted in all sampled clusters, and implemented by the
Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) on behalf of OPM, and included the variables necessary to
reconstruct the proxy means test (PMT) used for targeting the BISP transfer. In phase 3, from
the listing exercise a predetermined number of households were randomly selected using
simple random sampling, on which the PMT was applied. The PMT from the listing exercise
was a mimic of the BISP Poverty Scorecard described above, and an average of 100 household
PMTs were applied per PSU. Finally, in the fourth phase, households to whom the PMT was
applied were split into two groups. Group A households are defined as those households with
PMT scores equal and below the cut-off score of 16.17. Group B households are defined as
those households with a PMT score greater than the cut-off score of 16.17 and within a
predetermined range up to a score of 21.17, making them hypothetically valid
counterfactuals for the RDD methodology. Respective samples of Group A and Group B
households were chosen from within each PSU using simple random sampling.
           The baseline survey was conducted in 488 PSUs, with average sample sizes per PSU of
19 households per rural cluster and 15 households per urban cluster. The total baseline
sample size was 8,675 households. Sample size by group, province, and survey round is
reported in Table 2. Some households were already receiving BISP transfers at the time of the
baseline, and households were asked to self-report about their experiences with receiving
the BISP. The follow-up survey in 2013 attempted to reach the baseline households again, as

    This section relies heavily on data collection reports by Oxford Policy Management (2014).



                                                         8
well as households that split off from the original households. Consequently, the follow-up
survey attempted to reach 9,119 households, including split households. In total, 8,221
households were reached in the 2013 follow-up, implying an attrition rate of 9.8 percent.

      3.2. Constructing the Panel with Administrative Poverty Scores

           We use administrative data from the BISP Management Information System (MIS) to
locate the PMT of each household and its beneficiary status. As described above, the PMT is
a number that tells us whether or not the household is eligible, while the beneficiary status
reflects whether or not a specific woman received payments. By the 2013 survey, not all
eligible women had registered to receive payments. A drawback in the way that the baseline
data was collected is that individuals and households had to be matched to the BISP MIS,
largely using CNIC numbers which had to be collected, written onto survey forms, and then
entered into databases. If no women in the household had a CNIC card (either because they
actually do not have one or because it was not recorded properly on the survey form), it is
not possible to match the household to the baseline (or follow-up) survey data. From a
matching perspective, an additional complication is that some households had multiple
women with CNIC cards, who may have also been given different poverty scores when the
BISP census took place. 5 We treat such households by using the lowest possible poverty
score, as we are interested in overall household eligibility for transfers.
           Given the chances for errors in entering CNIC numbers and the general ambiguity in
the way multiple CNIC numbers should be treated, there were several chances for errors to
take place. Moreover, women with CNIC cards may not have attempted to register for BISP
payments, which would preclude their inclusion in the BISP MIS. Using all possible CNIC
numbers, of the 8,221 panel households we matched 5,650 households to the BISP MIS, so
2,583 households drop from the sample (Figure 1). Of these 5,650 households, 2,924 are
eligible to be beneficiaries (have a PMT below 16.17) and 2,726 are not eligible (have a PMT




5
    Less than 25 percent of matched households have more than one resident married woman with a CNIC card.

above 16.17). 6 Of those households that we could not match, in 606 households no woman
reported owning a CNIC card, and in 53 households it is reported as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know‚Äù or missing
whether any married women have a CNIC card. Hence, there are 1,912 households that could
not be matched to the BISP in which married women reported having CNIC cards.
         Consequently, there are effectively two levels of attrition from the data set. First,
there are households interviewed in the baseline that could not be found in the second
round; these households again could have had CNIC cards or not. Additionally, though we
have information on the PMT for 5,650 households, we do not have information on whether
or not of 55 of those households received transfers, so they further drop from the sample.
For the purposes of the paper, we provide some comparisons between statistics generated
using the full sample and the estimation sample.7
         Because the CNIC card is required for BISP receipt and not all women had one at
baseline, one may be concerned that those who were eligible for the transfer were more
likely to obtain a CNIC card and therefore more likely to show up in our sample, potentially
biasing our estimates. Therefore, for our estimates we drop all households in which women
report obtaining a CNIC card between rounds, resulting in an estimation sample of 4,981
households.
         Finally, we note that by combining these data sources, we are largely measuring the
household level impact of receiving BISP transfers, as any recipient within a household might
affect outcomes among all.             One might be concerned that some households receive
additional benefits (e.g. those with multiple transfer eligibility) and thus we do not properly
account for these multiple transfers with an indicator variable at the household level
measuring BISP transfer receipt. That said, the BISP transfer is constant at 1000 rupees per
beneficiary, and does not account at all for household size. So the per capita benefits in a

  We also considered dropping beneficiaries at baseline from the sample. We do not, because the estimation
strategy we use‚Äîregression discontinuity design‚Äîis theoretically unbiased for the difference at endline, so
there is no need to remove beneficiaries at baseline.
7
  The increase in the number of households in which married women had obtained CNICs can be considered a
result of the BISP program, though we cannot make a causal estimate of the impact. The CNIC effectively
ensures the citizenship of these women, allowing them access to any social services as well as voting eligibility.

single transfer household are much smaller for an 8 person household than for a four person
household (for example). One should interpret our results as averaged across single and
multiple beneficiary households; potentially taking into account the number of transfers (or
the per capita amount of transfers) is a possible extension of this work and a question of
interest in the general literature on cash transfers.



       4. Methodology

Although BISP receipt is not random, its implementation was designed to allow for causal
identification of its impacts. The PMT was used as a cutoff for the BISP specifically to be able
to use regression discontinuity design (RDD) as an evaluation strategy. Under RDD, marginally
ineligible households serve as a comparison group for marginally eligible households (above
and below the PMT cut-off of 16.17). However, the discontinuity is not sharp, meaning that
some households below the threshold do not receive transfers, and some households just
above the threshold do receive transfers. Therefore we use fuzzy RDD design to measure
impacts of the BISP transfer, which we briefly explain below.

       4.1. Regression Discontinuity Design

                 RDD was first introduced by Thistlewaite and Campbell (1960) and an excellent review
of RDD in economics can be found in Lee and Lemieux (2010). Following Lee and Lemieux‚Äôs
notation, consider a variable X that is used to determine program participation. Observations
with a value of Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã ‚â• Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê , where c is the threshold, are eligible for the program, while individuals
with a Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã < Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê are not eligible. We can therefore define a dummy variable for treatment such
that Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞∑ = 1 if Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã ‚â• Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê and Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞∑ = 0 if Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã < Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê .
                 Now, consider an outcome Y that that the program above may affect. Prior to
program participation, there is no reason to expect that the relationship between Y and X
would be discontinuous at the value Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã = Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê . So long as Y is continuous over the range of X
near Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã = Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê , one can consider the average treatment effect at c as:
Ì†µÌºèÌ†µÌºè = lim Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ∞∏ [Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ |Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•] ‚àí lim Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ∞∏ [Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ |Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•]                (1)
         Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã‚ÜìÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê                              Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã‚ÜëÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê



                                                                                     11
where i indexes individuals.
            Although the average treatment effect estimated using RDD is limited because it is
local, as Lee and Lemieux (2010) point out this design is actually akin to a localized random
experiment. Given that the treatment assignment D is defined solely based on a specific value
of X, it is a somewhat trivial assumption that unobservables are not related to D, so the
estimate of Ì†µÌºèÌ†µÌºè is unbiased by design. Further, one can test whether other variables that should
not be affected by the treatment are indeed continuous in X at the threshold, as one would
expect. And finally, as in a randomized experiment, it is not necessary to also control for any
other baseline covariates W in a linear regression framework. However, one can add
covariates to the regression to attempt to explain some of the variation in the dependent
variable. Theoretically, doing so can reduce standard errors on estimated coefficients since
the unexplained variance decreases.
            The RDD explained to this point is a sharp RDD, meaning that the probability that
someone receives the program is zero if the variable X is below c and one if the individual has
a value of X above c. In the case of Pakistan BISP, the ‚Äúforcing‚Äù variable X is the PMT and the
cutoff c is 16.17, but some households below the threshold receive transfers and some above
the threshold receive them. In terms of RDD, we can call this occurrence imperfect
compliance to the forcing rule. Trochim (1984) termed this occurrence as fuzzy RDD design,
and showed that all that is required to demonstrate impacts at the threshold is that
lim Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ∞∏ [Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞∑ = 1|Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã = Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•] ‚â† lim Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ∞∏ [Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞∑ = 1|Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã = Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•]                              (2)
Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã‚ÜìÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê                                     Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã‚ÜëÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê

Since the probability of treatment at the threshold c no longer increases from zero to one,
the jump in the relationship between Y and X cannot be interpreted as a local average
treatment effect. However, the treatment effect can be estimated as in an instrumental
variables framework. Theoretically, to obtain the local average treatment effect one can
divide the jump in the relationship between Y and X at c by the jump in probability of
treatment at c:
                       lim Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ∞∏ÔøΩÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å ÔøΩÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã = Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±• ÔøΩ‚àílim Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ∞∏ÔøΩÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÔøΩÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã = Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±• ÔøΩ

                                                                                               (3)

                                                                                          12
where, again following Lee and Lemieux (2010), the F subscript denotes ‚Äúfuzzy.‚Äù Imbens and
Angrist (1994) demonstrate that this ratio can be interpreted as a causal effect if we assume
monotonicity and excludability. Monotonicity implies that when X crosses the threshold
value c, it does not also cause some observations to take up the treatment and others to
reject it. Excludability implies that crossing the threshold cannot affect the outcome Y except
through the impact on the receipt of treatment.
               To estimate equation (3), we assume that we can write the probability of treatment
as:

Pr(Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = 1|Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±• ) = Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌªæ + Ì†µÌªøÌ†µÌªøÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌ±îÌ†µÌ±î(Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±• ‚àí Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê )                                (4)


where Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = 1(Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ ‚â• Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê) indicates whether the forcing variable exceeds the threshold, and g(.)
is a function of the distance from the threshold; Œ¥ represents the increase in probability of
treatment at the threshold. We can theoretically write thatDÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = Pr(Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = 1|Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±• ) + Ì†µÌºîÌ†µÌºîÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ ,
where Ì†µÌºîÌ†µÌºîÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ is a disturbance term independent of Xi, and then we can characterize the fuzzy
RDD with a two equation system:

Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌªºÌ†µÌªº + Ì†µÌºèÌ†µÌºèÌ†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ì(Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ ‚àí Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê ) + Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ
                (5)
Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌªæ + Ì†µÌªøÌ†µÌªøÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌ±îÌ†µÌ±î(Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ ‚àí Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê ) + Ì†µÌºîÌ†µÌºîÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ
                (6)


               Estimation of equations (5) and (6) can be performed with local linear regression and
two stage least squares (2SLS). An important choice in RDD analysis is selecting the range of
values of the running variable which are used to conduct estimation, termed the bandwidth.
While the estimates are unbiased in the limit at the threshold, one must use data to actually
estimate the treatment effect Ì†µÌºèÌ†µÌºèÌ†µÌ∞πÌ†µÌ∞π using data, which implies that as data farther away from the
threshold is used in estimation, estimates for Ì†µÌºèÌ†µÌºèÌ†µÌ∞πÌ†µÌ∞π become more susceptible to bias, as
observations on either side of the threshold become less and less comparable as data are
added. On the other hand, the inclusion of additional data on either side of the threshold
allows for more precise estimates. To choose a bandwidth for estimation, then, one must
balance the bias of including more observations against the variance of treatment effect


                                                                               13
estimates. A second complication in fuzzy RDD design is whether to focus on the bias-variance
tradeoff in equation (5) or equation (6); Imbens and Lemieux (2008) suggest focusing on the
outcome equation (5) for selecting the bandwidth and using the same bandwidth for the
treatment equation (6). We test the sensitivity of results to alternative bandwidths.
        In estimation, we use procedures developed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titunik
(2014a, 2014b) to determine the optimal bandwidth. The estimator uses a local linear
regression on either side of the threshold and includes a data driven bias correction as well
as bias corrected confidence interval estimation. The estimator uses a triangular kernel for
data included in regressions, as also suggested by Lee and Lemieux (2010). 8
        We provide two sets of estimates for each outcome. First, we provide estimates using
equations (5) and (6) as written in a local linear regression framework. However, these
estimates ignore available information on both baseline covariates and the baseline value of
the outcome variable. While there is no theoretical need to include either for unbiased
estimates, as discussed above including such variables can reduce variance of estimates and
improve precision; furthermore, they take advantage of the panel nature of the data.
Consequently, we also estimate versions of equations (5) and (6) that include the baseline
outcome and a set of baseline control variables; for these estimates, we follow the procedure
defined by Calonico et al. (2016). Other than the baseline value of the outcome, baseline
controls include the logarithm of per capita consumption, household size, the years of
schooling of the household head, and whether or not the head was female.

    4.2. Demonstrating the Discontinuity

Given the theoretical discussion, within the estimation sample our first goal is to show that
there is a discontinuous jump in the probability of transfer receipt at the PMT threshold of
16.17. If no such obvious jump exists, then the poverty score is generally not a valid forcing
variable. First, we visually examine the discontinuity among the sample of households in the
panel. We visually examine the discontinuity in Figure 2 by plotting the probability of transfer

8
 We have tested other kernels (e.g. rectangular, Epanachikov) and results shown in the paper are consistent
under a variety of kernels.



                                                     14
receipt on the y-axis and the PMT on the x-axis, with the probability of transfer receipt
measured administratively. The graph shows average BISP beneficiary status within bins of
0.2 points of the PMT score. The data is fit with a fourth order polynomial estimated
separately on either side of the eligibility cut off.
        The graphs illustratesa smooth, nearly flat relationship between the probability of
receiving payment and the poverty score on the left hand side of the graph. At the threshold,
the probability of receiving transfers at the threshold among eligible households is above 80
percent. We observe a fairly substantial percentage of households receiving transfers just
above the threshold (around 25 percent), but the probability quickly drops off as the poverty
score increases. This finding is consistent with the program rules, which award transfers to
certain classes of households with poverty scores above 16.17, but by a poverty score of 21.17
no household should receive transfers. The probabilities of receiving transfers generated
from the administrative data are largely consistent with these rules. Further, this break
should be large enough to identify the impacts of the transfers.
        Second, we estimate a version of equation (5), which specifies the relationship
between the probability of receiving payments and the poverty score as a function. We
estimate the equation with a linear functional form (Table 3), allowing for different
relationships on either side of the threshold with interaction terms. Using all of the data on
either side of the threshold, and without weighting observations, we estimate that the
discontinuity leads to a jump of 54.8 to 55.1 percentage points (columns 1 and 3), depending
upon whether we use the full sample of beneficiaries (column 1) or those who had CNIC cards
at baseline (column 2). 9 Given the strong indication of a discontinuity, we proceed to use local
linear regression to estimate impacts of the BISP transfer.

    4.3. Manipulation Testing

Prior to examining the results it is important to further test the validity of the RDD estimation
strategy. As described by McCrary (2008), an important concern is that subjects might be able

9
 Note that when we use this equation as something akin to a first stage with an optimal bandwidth
calculation as well as triangular weights, the threshold estimate depends upon both.



                                                    15
to manipulate the forcing variable, thereby invalidating the assumption that those
immediately to the left of the cutoff are directly comparable to those immediately to the right
of the cutoff. First, it should be noted that the nature of the PMT makes manipulation difficult
if not impossible. The PMT is constructed from 23 different variables and because households
did not know either how the score was constructed or the cutoff used for eligibility, it is not
clear how they could have directly manipulated their score to ensure eligibility. Despite this
point, we can still use the data to directly test for such a manipulation. If individuals were
indeed able to manipulate their scores we would expect to observe a discontinuity would
exist in the density of the forcing variable at the threshold. We test this possibility in this
section.
       Initially, we want to visually inspect the data to determine whether or not the poverty
score appears to have been manipulated. We therefore initially show a histogram of
administrative poverty scores, in 50 bins, for households with poverty scores between 0 and
32.34 (or double the threshold; Figure 3). If there was manipulation of the dependent
variable, we would expect to observe a bunching of the data just below the threshold, or
more density in the histogram just below the threshold. We might expect then a concurrent
drop in the probability just above the threshold. While the histogram does not appear to be
smooth, neither does it suggest such a discontinuity; the lack of smoothness may be a result
of the somewhat non-standard sampling procedure that was followed to develop the sample.
       Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2015) develop an alternative test that is based on a more
flexible, fully data driven approach than the more traditionally estimated McCrary (2008)
density test, which requires the data to be initially placed in ‚Äúbins,‚Äù hence adding parameters
to the estimation problem. We estimate the Cattaneo et al. manipulation test for both the
overall sample (e.g. all 5,650 matched households) as well as the estimation subsample
(households in which women had a CNIC card at baseline). We prefer what Cattaneo et al.
deem the undersmoothed version of the test statistic; their preferred version includes a bias
correction, and the bias correction involves a computation of the bias that would be affected




                                              16
by the sampling procedure. 10 Nonetheless, we report both versions of the test statistic. We
find that we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no discontinuity in three of the four cases
(Table 4); in the fourth, when examining the overall sample with the bias-corrected statistic,
it rejects at the 10 percent level. We only use that sample in estimating consumption results,
and the undersmoothed version of the test does not reject, so manipulation of the running
variable does not appear to be a concern in most of our estimates.

     4.4 Continuity at the Threshold: Covariates

A second common test for the validity of RDD is to test the density of baseline variables that
we might consider ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù variables, or variables that we would not expect to be affected
by the program. The density of such variables should appear continuous through the
threshold, else we might be concerned that impact estimates will be biased due to selection
on such characteristics. One could use a direct statistical test here; one way to do so is to
estimate an RDD regression as noted above using baseline characteristics as false
‚Äúoutcomes.‚Äù However, one can also simply visually inspect the data initially to look for breaks,
and if a break appears to occur one can then conduct more rigorous statistical tests.
        We illustrate continuity at the threshold for four sets of variables measured at
baseline. First, we examine variables related to household demographics (Figure 4);
specifically, we consider household size, whether or not the household has a female head,
whether or not the head is married, and the years of schooling of the household head. In all
four cases, the distributions on either side of the threshold appear to match nicely, and have
expected patterns; household size declines with the poverty score, while the head‚Äôs
education level increases with the poverty score.




10
  In work not shown here, we demonstrate with a Monte Carlo experiment that the optimal bandwidth as
defined by Cattaneo et al. (2014a) is perhaps not surprisingly dependent upon the sampling procedure, and
that the optimal bandwidth provided by the accompanying software is actually only truly optimal for a simple
random sample. Since the bias correction provided by their software depends upon this bias calculation, for
this particular sampling procedure it is not necessarily right, and as such we prefer the undersmoothed rather
than the bias corrected statistic.



                                                      17
       Second, we consider variables related to consumer durables and housing owned at
baseline (Figure 5). We examine whether or not households owned a TV, a cooking stove,
their residence, and a washing machine. All four variables show the expected pattern; that is,
they become more likely as the poverty score increases. Important for the validity of impact
of impact estimates, we observe no difference in the pattern of data around the threshold
for any of the variables.
       Third, we examine some housing characteristics (Figure 6). Specifically, we examine
whether households have a mud floor, the number of rooms in the house, whether or not
the household has a toilet, and whether or not the household has a thatched roof. We again
find sensible patterns in the data, in terms of a negative correlation between a mud floor, a
toilet, and a thatched roof versus the poverty score, and no evidence of a structural break at
the threshold for any of the four variables.
       As a final check, one might be concerned that households with more married women
in them might have been targeted for transfers. If there was a structural break in the number
of married women per household, then the probability of receiving multiple transfers in the
household would also change and confound the average impact estimate (averaged over the
number of transfers actually received). We plot the number of married women against the
normed poverty score, and find no evidence of a structural break (Figure 7), suggesting this
bias is not present in impact estimates. Consequently, we conclude that continuity in the
distribution of a wide variety of baseline characteristics do not differ substantially at the
threshold, and there is no evidence of this type of bias. Combining this evidence, we feel
comfortable that baseline characteristics are continuous at the poverty score threshold,
which implies that we do not need to be concerned about this type of potential bias in
program impact estimates.



   5. Impacts on Women‚Äôs Empowerment

As the BISP cash transfer is specifically targeted to women, and women‚Äôs labor force
participation is relatively low, a guaranteed income stream specifically for women may have


                                               18
important impacts on women‚Äôs empowerment. Therefore, it is important to test whether the
BISP transfer has impacts on women‚Äôs empowerment. We examine potential impacts in
several ways, and we group variables that relate to empowerment into two broad categories.
First, we look at a set of outcomes related to opinions about gender norms reported by both
men and women, and then we examine a set of outcomes related primarily to female
mobility, but also to voting.
       Our initial list of variables relates to gender norms that may have changed over time
as a consequence of receiving the BISP transfer. The variables are all as indicated in Table 1
(disagree that only male should make important decisions, agree male should help with
household chores, agree that female should work, agree that wife should express opinion,
disagree that wife should tolerate being beaten, and disagree that it‚Äôs better to send son to
school than daughter). These variables were constructed from ratings scales stating ‚Äústrongly
agree‚Äù, ‚Äúagree‚Äù, ‚Äúdisagree‚Äù, or ‚Äústrongly disagree;‚Äù so each answer was collapsed first to a
binary zero/one variable. In each case, the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù outcome is always coded as one.
       Table 5 summarizes male and female responses in the estimation sample for all six
variables. These are averages across all households who are eligible for the transfer, hence
any changes between surveys reflect changes averaged across eligible and ineligible
households. We find that in most cases, men actually suggest more positive answers than
women do. For example, whereas only 25 percent of men in each survey disagree with the
statement that a wife should tolerate being beaten by her husband, 18 percent of women
disagree at baseline (and only 13 percent disagree in 2013). The only exception is the
statement about women being able to work outside the home; women are 20 percentage
points more likely to agree with that statement.
       To study whether the BISP transfer has an impact on these norms, we present both
estimates using the 2013 outcome as the dependent variable alone, while also estimating a
model using a set of control variables, including the baseline outcome. Other control variables
in those regressions include the logarithm of monthly consumption per capita, the household
size, the head‚Äôs education level, and whether or not the head was female, all measured at




                                              19
baseline. In each case, the PMT score is used as an instrument for beneficiary status as
reported in the administrative data, and the analysis is on the individual level.
        As discussed above, to estimate impacts we must choose a bandwidth that trades off
bias and precision. For both specifications, we show results using three bandwidths: a narrow
bandwidth of 3, a larger bandwidth of 5, and the optimal bandwidth resulting from the
calculation in Calonico et al. (2014b). We do not solely rely on the optimal bandwidth
computation because it implicitly assumes a simple random sample, and the sample here
clearly attempted to measure more households near the threshold than away from it.
Specifically, the program tried to sample within the bandwidth of 5 from the threshold, and
we choose 3 as well as the calculated optimal bandwidth often falls between 3 and 5. For all
variables, we run separate regressions for women and men. 11
        We first discuss the impacts on the female reports (Table 6). Across specifications and
outcomes, the estimated impacts are generally positive; in the cross-sectional regressions
(Panel A), all estimated coefficients are positive. However, a lack of statistical power means
that the results fall short of statistical significance in most cases. The strongest results are in
column 5, for the outcome of women disagreeing that the wife should tolerate being beaten,
where there is a strong and significant positive impact for five of the six specifications, and
they are significant at the 5 percent level for the optimal bandwidth, whether or not we
control for covariates. Figure 8 shows the column 5 results graphically, using the cross-
sectional outcome. The scatterplot is the average of the outcome variable by bins of size 0.5
points, with a quadratic regression line and 90 percent confidence intervals fit on either side
of the cutoff. It also is suggestive that women who receive the transfer are more likely to
disagree with the statement.
        When we estimate impacts of the BISP on the same set of questions about gender
norms among men, results show a similar pattern (Table 7). Though almost all of the
estimated coefficients are positive, only a few are consistently significantly different from



11
  We also ran regressions using agreement between men and women on the answer as a dependent variable;
however, we did not find any significant impacts so we do not show them here.



                                                  20
zero. The strongest results for men are in column 2 (agreement that males should help with
household chores) and column 4 (agreement that wives should be able to express opinions).
The latter is only significant at the five percent level when we control for covariates. We again
show cross-sectional results for the agreement on helping with household chores are shown
graphically in Figure 9; the graph is suggestive of a discontinuity at the threshold, or an impact
on male answers to that question. Interestingly, the strongest result found for women is one
in which overall agreement is quite low among women (the sample mean is 13 percent) while
for men the two stronger results occur for outcomes on which agreement is quite high among
men (the sample mean is about 74 percent for both variables).
       We next examine outcomes related to female mobility. These variables are reports by
women about where they are able to go alone: local market, local health facility, friends‚Äô
home, and nearby shrine or mosque. We add one variable to this analysis; specifically,
whether or not the woman reports voting either sometimes or all the time (Table 8). As with
the estimates on gender norms, all estimated impacts for mobility measures across
specifications are positive in the cross-section, but again they are not consistently statistically
significant. The results in column 3 for women being permitted to go to friends‚Äô homes alone
are significant, showing a strong increase of the BISP transfer in women being allowed to visit
their friends. There is also compelling evidence that women are more likely to vote when they
receive the transfer, as the impact is significant in three of six specifications, and coefficients
are larger and statistically significant when we control for the baseline value in Panel B. The
optimal bandwidth suggests a 15 percentage point increase in the proportion of women who
are allowed to vote, from 73 percent in the control group. The results for both of these
outcomes are shown graphically in Figures 10 and 11, and again are quite suggestive of
positive impacts of the BISP transfer.
       Given the positive coefficients that are found for all of the variables in the cross-
section, but only a handful were statistically different from zero, we next create an index of
these variables. First, we add up a ‚Äúscore‚Äù consisting of the six gender norms as reported by




                                                21
women; then we sum up the measures of women‚Äôs mobility, both with and without the voting
measure, and finally we consider the sum of the gender norms as reported by men. 12
        We estimate these four regressions in Table 9. The results in Panel A with fixed
bandwidth, regardless of the bandwidth, suggest positive and significant impacts on all four
indices (at the 10 percent level or better). However, all of the indices among women lose
their statistical significance in Panel A when we use the optimal bandwidth, which tends to
be higher than 5. However, from the men‚Äôs answers about gender norms, all of the
coefficients are significant at the 5 percent level or better, suggesting an increased value of
0.6 relative to a mean of 3.1, suggesting meaningful improvements in women‚Äôs
empowerment from the perspective of men.
        These results only differ slightly when we add the baseline outcome and control
variables as covariates (Panel B). The overall index, including gender norms and the mobility
variable, does exhibit significant at the 10 percent level when we use the optimal bandwidth
(column 3). Among men, the results become even stronger, suggesting a 0.8 point increase
in the men‚Äôs index. These results suggest that although the outcome by outcome measures
of empowerment may appear to be only suggestive, when combining a variety of measures
the evidence is at least strongly supportive that the BISP results in an increase in men‚Äôs
perception of women‚Äôs empowerment.
        In sum, there is reasonably strong evidence that the BISP transfer has had some
impacts on women‚Äôs empowerment. Along the lines of some specific gender norms, men‚Äôs
and women‚Äôs attitudes appear to change, and women feel more freedom to visit their friends.
In all, the coefficients we estimate in the cross-section are all positive, suggesting a
movement towards more women‚Äôs empowerment. Giving cash, even small amounts, to
women appears to have had at least a small impact on their empowerment within
households.




12
  We have also experimented with, for example, examining the first principal component of the matrix of
outcomes; the results are similar but more difficult to interpret, so we stick with the simple sum.



                                                    22
   6. Conclusion

Using fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find some evidence of impacts on outcomes
related to women‚Äôs empowerment in Pakistan as a result of the receipt of the BISP transfer.
Specifically, we find that the transfer appears to cause wives to report they are less likely to
tolerate being beaten, and we find that men are more likely to agree that they should be
expected to help around the house. Women also become more likely to report that they can
visit friends without permission, and they become more likely to vote. Finally, it must be
mentioned that the proportion of women with a CNIC card substantially increased between
2011 and 2013, particularly for women below the poverty score threshold; in the data set,
the percentage of married women reporting having a CNIC number increased from 82
percent in 2011 to 89 percent in 2013. While we cannot statistically attribute that increase to
the presence of the BISP transfer, it is highly unlikely that the increase would have been so
large without the BISP.
       Given that women‚Äôs status is perceived to be low in Pakistan relative to many other
countries, and that women‚Äôs empowerment is correlated with economic growth (Duflo,
2011), any increases in women‚Äôs empowerment are a good sign for Pakistan‚Äôs economy in
the future. As transfers have increased in size since the data for this paper were collected,
and the transfers have increased in regularity, some of the impacts may have also become
stronger since 2013. That said, given the limits of the questions asked as it stands in the data
set, it would be interesting to take qualitative work already completed (OPM, 2014) on the
BISP transfer to develop women‚Äôs empowerment modules further to be able to understand
how women‚Äôs empowerment is affected by the BISP in a more nuanced, subtle manner.

Note: p-values associated with test statistics in italics. Undersmoothed version of test reduces bandwidth to
reduce bias associated with the parametric approximation of the test statistic, whereas the bias corrected
version instead uses a higher order polynomial (than used in estimating densities) to attempt to model the
bias in the test statistic.

Note: Estimates of impact of receiving BISP transfers are calculated using the robust fuzzy regression discontinuity estimator
developed in Calonico et al. (2015). The p-values reported are associated with a robust local-polynomial estimate, and are bias
corrected, and estimation uses the triangular kernel. Sample sizes used in estimation to the right and left of the threshold are
reported, as is the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù bandwidth when it is calculated. Sample means in this table only refer to the observations within the
optimal bandwidth.

Note: Estimates of impact of receiving BISP transfers are calculated using the robust fuzzy regression discontinuity
estimator developed in Calonico et al. (2015). The p-values reported are associated with a robust local-polynomial
estimate, and are bias corrected, and estimation uses the triangular kernel. Sample sizes used in estimation to the right
and left of the threshold are reported, as is the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù bandwidth when it is calculated. Sample means in this table
only refer to the observations within the optimal bandwidth.

Abstract

Large-scale government cash transfer programs have become an important element of social
protection and poverty reduction strategies throughout the developing world. Pakistan is no
exception; in 2008, Pakistan established the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) as an
unconditional cash transfer targeted at the poorest of the poor. The primary goal of the BISP
program is to provide the poorest households in Pakistan with unconditional transfers in order
to improve their consumption and investments in children. To attain this goal, it is believed
important that the transfers are provided directly to women to ensure the funds are spent as
intended. Beyond changes in consumption and investment, directing these transfers to women
can also serve to empower women by increasing household resources under their control. We
analyze the impacts of Pakistan‚Äôs BISP program on women‚Äôs decision-making power within
households using data collected between 2011 and 2013 as the program was rolling out. Using
fuzzy regression discontinuity methods to statistically identify impacts, the BISP transfer is found
to have substantial, positive impacts on some variables measuring women‚Äôs decision-making
power and empowerment.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Myanmar perceive the Bank Group;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Myanmar regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Myanmar;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Myanmar;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s operations, knowledge work and
              activities, and communication and information sharing in Myanmar;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Myanmar.
    Use data to help inform Myanmar country team’s strategy.
II. Methodology
Between June and August 2014, 662 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Myanmar were
invited to provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country
opinion survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minster; office
of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 173 stakeholders participated in the survey (26% response rate).
Respondents received and returned questionnaires through the courier service. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Myanmar; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
importance and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; the WBG’s future role in
Myanmar; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Myanmar: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Myanmar is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas the government should focus on, which areas would
   contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth in Myanmar, and how
   “shared prosperity? would be best achieved.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, its effectiveness in Myanmar, WBG staff preparedness to
   help Myanmar solve its development challenges, WBG’s local presence, WBG’s capacity
   building in Myanmar, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work,
   and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents were
   asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments
   in helping reduce poverty in Myanmar, in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus most
   of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to which groups the institution
   should reach out more.

II. Methodology (continued)
C. Sectoral Importance and World Bank Group’s Results: Respondents were asked to rate the
   extent to which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Myanmar, the extent
   to which the WBG meets Myanmar’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, the importance for the WBG to be involved in thirty five development areas,
   such as education, poverty reduction, public sector governance/reform, and
   security/stabilization/reconstruction. They were also asked to rate the extent to which the
   WBG helps build existing country systems in Myanmar.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to rate
   the effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Myanmar: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Myanmar and which services the
   Bank Group should offer more of in the country. They were asked what areas the country
   would benefit most from the WBG playing a leading role and what areas it would benefit
   most from other donors.
F. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its social
   media channels, levels of easiness to find information they needed, the levels of easiness to
   navigate the WBG websites, and whether they use WBG data more often than before.
G. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Myanmar, which WBG agencies they work with, whether they think that IFC and
   WB work well together, and their geographic locations.

    “When thinking about how the World Bank Group can have the most impact on development results in
   Myanmar, in which sectoral areas do you believe the World Bank Group should focus most of its resources
               (financial and knowledge services) in Myanmar ? (Choose no more than THREE)?
                               (Respondents chose from a list. Responses combined.)


 When more than 10% of the sample are respondents from a particular sector (see the full list of specialized
 areas in question G2 in Appendix G), analyses are done to see these respondents’ views about which areas the
 World Bank Group should focus its attention and resources on.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Where the World Bank Group Should Focus its Resources (continued)
       Respondents across stakeholder groups, geographic locations, and sectoral areas agreed
        on the top areas where they think the WBG should focus its resources.
       It is worth pointing out that respondents who collaborate with the WBG were
        significantly less likely to think that the institution should focus on “education,?
        compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG.
       In addition, respondents who collaborate with the WBG were significantly more likely to
        think that the institution should focus on “public sector governance/reform? than
        respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG.

The World Bank recently guaranteed a Sovereign bond issue that was difficult for some investors to value. This
paper will help future investors in World Bank guaranteed bonds by explaining four ways to value ways to value
these types of instruments. A hypothetical US$1 billion, 15-year, soft-bullet maturity bond issued by the
government of fictional Emergistan, all supported by a US$400 million World Bank non-accelerable first loss
guarantee, was used to analyze each method.
The first technique considered was the nominal weighted average yield method, which is a simple approach
but does not capture the rolling aspect of a guarantee or account for the time value of money. The rolling
nominal weighted average yield method, as the second method, is more acc urate, accounts for a guarantee‚Äôs
rolling nature but does not account for the time value of money. The discounted cash flow approach, as a third
method, assesses time value but does not include the rolling feature of the guarantee. None of these methods
therefore fully values a World Bank guarantee.
Recovery analysis is a more comprehensive and more complex way to value a World Bank guarantee. This
involves calculating the implied annual probability of default, simulating the behavior of the World Bank
guarantee and recoveries from Emergistan and then calculating the yield of the bond after the probability of
default and payments received under the World Bank guarantee are included. The implied value of the
guarantee in the study case is 270 ‚Äì 383 basis points, which is greater than the other methods because it fully
captures time value and the value of a rolling guarantee.
The structure considered in this note is only one of many possibilities as the guarantee instrument offered by
the World Bank is highly flexible. Investors should therefore carry out their own analysis to determine the
methodology they believe to be the most relevant to price a particular security.

First step: extract the annual implied probability of default from outstanding bonds (annual probability of default
found such that the risk-adjusted YTM is equal to the risk free rate, in this case the US Treasury yield, plus any
liquidity premium currently priced by the market)
The formula used to calculate the implied annual probability of default is the following:


                                             (1 + Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±ÄÌ†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±Ä ) √ó (1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±Ä ) + Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±Ä √ó Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±Ä = 1 + Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±ì + Ì†µÌ∞ø

Where:
YTMEM is the Yield of Emergistan
PdEM is the probability of default of Emergistan
REM is the estimated recovery rate following an event of default of Emergistan
Rf is the risk free rate (US Treasury)
L is the liquidity premium embedded in Emergistan‚Äôs yield (accounts for the fact that Emergistan‚Äôs spread over UST
is not credit risk only)

First step: check that the risk-adjusted YTM of the Emergistan bond is equal to the risk free rate + liquidity premium

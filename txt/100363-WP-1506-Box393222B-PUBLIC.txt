Based on the information provided by the Ongoing Household Survey, we estimate the
mechanisms‚Äô potential inclusion and exclusion errors. The results permit us to suggest that
the categorical selection mechanisms used in the three programs are effective in reaching
the poorest population, although they present distinct levels of inclusion and exclusion errors
associated with both the design and implementation problems of the particular mechanism
utilized.

I.    Introduction

Social protection policies in the Plurinational State of Bolivia have undergone significant
transformations during the last 10 years. These changes parallel what has occurred in the
majority of Latin American countries, where diverse household cash transfer and youth labor
training programs have been implemented with the goal of alleviating poverty, contributing
to the development of human capital, stemming the intergenerational transmission of
poverty, and improving employability.

The 2006-2011 National Development Plan articulated four strategies central to the
development of the country: Respectable, Democratic, Productive, and Sovereign Bolivia. The
first of these 2 refers to asset-creating sectors and inter-sectorial social protection programs.
The focus is not centered just on the provision of basic services, but also on the promotion of
households‚Äô economic capacities. Its objectives include: a) create an equitable pattern of the
distribution of wealth and opportunities; b) promote the full exercise of dignity and
individuals‚Äô and social groups‚Äô rights; and c) implement development programs designed to
drastically reduce risk situations and their consequences.

As part of this strategy, the country launched a set of cash transfer and youth labor training
programs directed at promoting the accumulation of human capital within households. In
2006, the Juancito Pinto Educational Grant was created with the objective of increasing
school enrollment and reducing desertion rates among children and adolescents. Three years
later, the Juana Azurduy Mother-Child Grant was launched with the goal of decreasing the
levels of maternal and infant mortality and chronic malnutrition among children below age 2
through an incentive to use healthcare services. Finally, also in 2009, the ‚ÄúMy First Decent
Job‚Äù Program was started with the goal of confronting the shortcomings in terms of

  The second strategy, Democratic Bolivia, refers to the formation of a Social-Community State where ‚Äúthe
people exercise social power and are co-responsible for decisions related to their own development‚Äù. The third
strategy, Productive Bolivia is aimed at transforming the productive matrix to achieve the development of
Comprehensive Productive Complexes and giving the State the power to generate income and employment
surpluses based on the economy‚Äôs strategic sectors. Finally, the fourth strategy, Sovereign Bolivia, refers to a
change in the country‚Äôs foreign policy with greater representation of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù abroad and the defense of
natural resources and biodiversity.

employability for young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 by offering training and
internships.

Since their launches, the three programs have faced the challenge of using effective
mechanisms to identify and register the target population. Regular evaluations of the
effectiveness of the application of the targeting instruments allow for the analysis of potential
modifications to the instruments, as well as identifying needs for strengthening their
application.

In this context, the goal of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of the existing targeting
mechanisms for each of the programs, while at the same time analyzing the results of the
recently launched single mechanism for beneficiary identification from the Ministry of
Development Planning. The application of a single mechanism should improve efficiency (by
reducing the cost of identifying potential beneficiaries) as well as effectiveness (by reducing
inclusion and exclusion errors).

This document presents six sections in addition to this Introduction. In the second section,
we present the analytical framework that guides the discussion of the targeting mechanisms
utilized by the three programs in the analyses described in the third section. In the third
section, we present the three programs‚Äô general characteristics. Subsequently, in the fourth
section, we estimate the inclusion and exclusion errors associated with the beneficiary
identification tools for the three programs, under certain assumptions and design
characteristics, based on the information provided by the 2012 Ongoing Household Survey
(ECH), developed by the National Statistics Institute of Bolivia. In the fifth section, we
estimate the potential inclusion and exclusion errors for the recently launched Single Registry
of Beneficiaries for social programs. Finally, we offer some final reflections and provide a
bibliography of the works consulted.

II.   Analytical Framework

 The design and implementation of social protection policies rely on correctly diagnosing the
 problem or risk to be addressed. Examples include: vulnerability of a specific population
 group in the face of a situation of poverty or an elevated school desertion rate ‚Äì a lack of
 accumulation of human capital ‚Äì among children and youth, with a special emphasis on those
 that belong to households living in poverty, to mention a few. An accurate diagnosis permits
 one to define the target population that the initiative aims to reach with greater precision.
 This leads to the necessity of choosing a mechanism that allows for the identification of
 potentially eligible individuals. In general terms, there are two alternatives for reaching these
 individuals: either a universal program or a targeted one.

 The arguments in favor of universalization as a strategy to eradicate poverty have an ethical,
 political, and practical basis. The principal point of reference is the European experience,
 where poverty has been successfully fought via a framework of policies centered on
 guaranteeing services with universal coverage.

 Supporters of universal policies posit that the State should effectively guarantee basic rights,
 distributing the available resources among all citizens, regardless of whether or not they will
 be recovered, through direct general revenue schemes. Funds should originate from
 individuals with higher incomes. Nonetheless, available resources are generally limited. This
 requires policymakers to maximize their impact when they are put to use‚Äîin other words,
 to utilize the funds efficiently such that the greatest expected impact is achieved.

 Therefore, the arguments in favor of creating targeted policies are based on the need to focus
 the benefits on the target population, thus increasing efficiency in the use of cash transfers
 aimed at combating the problem or risk factor as previously identified through an assessment
 of the situation. Targeting criteria commonly used in social protection programs are age,
 gender, employment status, level of poverty, and/or geographic location. The utilization of
 targeting criteria as a condition for potential beneficiaries facing poverty requires
 policymakers to develop more complex, specific tools.




                                               -5-
In any case, following the situational assessment, the way in which the potentially eligible
population is defined and the argument behind this definition are key factors in terms of the
policy‚Äôs effectiveness. In contrast, incorrectly defining the target population could result in
design errors in the selection of beneficiaries. Based on the previous examples, the target
population could be households living in poverty and school-age children and youth living in
poverty. Once the problem and/or risk factor is assessed and the potentially eligible
population is defined, one must design a tool that allows said population to be identified and
reached.

In all cases, applying targeting criteria in social programs entails an administrative cost
associated with the work of creating, implementing, updating, and supervising the selection
tools (socioeconomic records, household surveys, poverty maps, etc.). One relevant aspect
when targeting mechanisms are designed is to evaluate whether the additional costs
associated with targeting are greater than the costs of universalization, represented as the
amount of transfers that reach the non-poor population for example (Atkinson, 1995).

The goal of targeting is for a social program‚Äôs resources to only reach the population whose
socioeconomic status is situated below the established threshold, as well as attempting to
ensure as much as possible that all members of the target group benefit from the program.
However, in addition to the increased administrative costs, there is a risk of committing two
types of targeting errors: inclusion and exclusion (Cornia and Steward, 1992). While
universalization schemes do not face exclusion errors (the exclusion from the program of
individuals and households that belong to the target group), in the case of targeted policies,
and depending on the effectiveness of the mechanisms utilized, these schemes can face both
inclusion and exclusion errors.

A standard exercise when one wants to evaluate the effectiveness of targeting mechanisms
is to analyze the tradeoff that exists between both types of errors. As a program attempts to
minimize inclusion errors‚Äîin other words, the more a program tries to avoid that the
ineligible population (the non-poor, for example) is included‚Äîthe probability of committing
an exclusion error increases, meaning that poorer people are left out of the program. In other


                                             -6-
words, the more eligibility requirements there are and the stricter they are, the smaller the
group of potentially eligible beneficiaries.

The risk of committing these kinds of errors can originate during two stages of the policy:
design and implementation. Regarding the former, inclusion and exclusion errors can emerge
as a consequence of incorrectly identifying the target population. For example, they could
result from design flaws in the mechanism: selecting personal and household characteristics
that are not correlated with the real problem or risk factor. In addition, the implementation
process, in other words identifying and approaching the program‚Äôs target population, can find
itself dependent on or limited by the program‚Äôs ability to reach the target population: it is not
clear who they are, where they are located, or how to approach them.

Targeting Mechanisms. The objective of targeting mechanisms is to correctly and efficiently
identify which households meet the eligibility requirements and which do not. The methods
for reaching a beneficiary group are divided into three categories: individual/family
evaluation; categorical and geographic selection; and self-targeting.

The individual/family evaluation determines for each household or individual if the applicant
meets the eligibility requirements established by the program. This type of tool requires the
highest level of effort from the program.

Within this category, the verified proxy means test stands out. It compiles (nearly) complete
information on household income level and/or assets and verifies this information with
independent sources, such as spending, tax, and other records. This requires that verifiable
records for the beneficiary population must exist and be updated regularly, as well as the
need for the administrative capacity to process this information.

In the absence of the capacity to carry out a verified means test, other individual evaluation
mechanisms are generally used. The three most common are simple proxy means testing,
substituted proxy means testing, and community-based selection.

In simple means testing, the conditions stated by the beneficiaries are not verified. A
household visit from one of the program‚Äôs social workers could help to qualitatively



                                               -7-
corroborate that the apparent living conditions reasonably coincide with the stated data. On
the other hand, evaluations performed by social workers could be completely qualitative and
account for many factors related to the household‚Äôs needs and means, without the
requirement to quantify them.

Proxy means testing is a system that scores each of the household or individual applicants
based on easily observable characteristics, such as the location and quality of the residence,
ownership of durable goods, household demographic structure, educational level, and
employment status. The indicators or formulas used to calculate these scores and their
weighting are derived from a statistical analysis of data from detailed household surveys.
Generally, the information provided by the applicant is partially verified by gathering
information from a household visit performed by a representative of the program.

Community-based selection uses a group of community members or one of their leaders
whose principal function is not related to the transfer program to decide which members of
the community should benefit from the program. An example of this is using special
committees comprised of community members or a combination of community members
and local officials to establish eligibility for a program. The idea behind this method is that
local knowledge of families‚Äô living conditions could be more accurate than data gathered via
means testing performed by a program representative.

The risk of committing inclusion and/or exclusion errors resulting from the setting up and
utilizing this type of mechanism is related to the level of correlation that exists between the
individual or household characteristics that are evaluated and those which truly determine
whether one is eligible or not, poverty for example. The more correlated actual poverty is
with the means that are measured (educational level, household property, mobile phone
ownership, etc.), the fewer inclusion and exclusion errors there will be.

The implementation of a targeting mechanism can result in these kinds of errors as well. For
example, the capabilities of the workers responsible for gathering data from each
individual/household determines the degree of error minimization.




                                             -8-
Categorical selection refers to a method by which all of the individuals in a specific category
meet the requirements to receive the benefit. This method is also known as statistical
selection, classification, or group targeting and determines eligibility in terms of easily
observable individual or family characteristics that are difficult to distort and are correlated
with the relevant characteristic (for example, poverty). Examples include: age, gender,
ethnicity, land ownership, demographic makeup, geographical location, the type of
educational institution attended, and the type of formal healthcare coverage possessed. Age
is a category that is frequently utilized in family cash transfer programs which are principally
used in transitioning countries, in supplemental nutrition programs for children below age
five which are common in poor countries, and in non-contributory pensions for the elderly.
Characteristics like unemployment and disabilities are more difficult to verify, but it is also
possible to use categorical selection for cash transfers to these groups.

Here again, correctly defining category in terms of its correlation to the real risk factor
determines the degree of inclusion and/or exclusion error that may result.

Geographic targeting means determining the eligible population based on where they live
(state, municipality, neighborhood, etc.). This type of mechanism is frequently used and is
generally combined with other methods.

Finally, via self-targeting a program is open to the entire population, but its design includes
features meant to incentivize just the participation of those households or groups that belong
to a specific group (for example, poor households), thereby disincentivizing the participation
of those that do not belong to this group. This is achieved by recognizing the differences in
the private costs of participation faced by poor and non-poor households. Examples of self-
targeting include:

‚Ä¢ employment programs with low salaries, so that only unemployed workers with low or no
  opportunity costs will participate;
‚Ä¢ delivering the transfer via a mechanism that includes lining up and is limited to certain
  hours;



                                              -9-
  ‚Ä¢ transferring in-kind benefits with characteristics of ‚Äúinferior goods‚Äù (for example, flour,
       low-quality rice, etc.); and
  ‚Ä¢ situating service delivery points (supply warehouses, clinics or hospitals, and participating
       schools, etc.) such that the non-poor population would incur greater costs (private and
       social).


III.      Transfer programs in Bolivia
                  3.1 Juancito Pinto Grant (BJP)

  In 2006, the national government of Bolivia decided to incentivize school enrollment and
  reduce desertion in the formal education system as one of its principal goals. Supreme Decree
  28,899 created the conditional cash transfer program known as the Juancito Pinto Grant
  (BJP). The BJP provides an annual transfer of Bs. 200 as an incentive to reduce school absence
  and desertion and to increase children‚Äôs enrollment and continuity in the country‚Äôs
  educational institutions.

  The target population consists of children and youth that attend the formal education system
  at public institutions. The program increased its target population over time, including more
  educational levels over the years, as shown in Table 1.

For each year, the mechanism to identify potential beneficiaries uses categorical selection
given that their eligibility is defined in terms of their individual characteristics.

After multiple modifications to the regulations, Supreme Decree 1,372 of 2012 established
that the program‚Äôs target population consisted of all primary school students (first through
sixth years) and students from the first, second, and third years of secondary school, including
Special Education and Alternative Youth Education students from all public sector educational
institutions and private institutions with agreements with the government. Additionally, the
BJP sets an age limit of 18 years old in order to receive the grant for the formal education and
alternative youth education systems. Based on this categorization, those children and
adolescents that attend private educational institutions are excluded from the program‚Äôs
benefits. Students must achieve a regular attendance rate of at least 80% during the school
year in order to receive the transfer. Figure 3.1 shows the evolution of the number of
beneficiaries and the total expenditure directed toward financing the BJP from 2006 to 2012.

The Juana Azurduy Mother-Child Grant (BJA) was created in 2009 with the objective of
‚Äúdecreasing the levels of maternal and infant mortality and chronic malnutrition among
children younger than two years old‚Äù. The target population comprises all pregnant women
and children younger than two years old that do not have formal healthcare coverage. The
stipend is a cash incentive of Bs. 320 that is given to the pregnant woman for attending four
prenatal checkups, Bs. 50 for each one, a delivery attended by healthcare personnel, and one
postnatal checkup (Bs. 120). For children younger than age 2, the program delivers a transfer
of Bs. 125 for each of the child‚Äôs two-month development checkups. In total, the mother
receives an incentive of Bs. 1,820.

The program comprises a ‚Äúdemand‚Äù incentive for healthcare services and covers all of the
municipalities in the country.

Figure 3.2 shows the evolution of the number of beneficiaries and the program‚Äôs expenditure
on transfers between 2009 and 2013. Given the high degree of turnover of pregnant women
and children due to their short participation in the program, reduced annual affiliation efforts
have resulted in a reduction in the number of beneficiaries.

                 3.3 . My First Decent Job

The ‚ÄúMy First Decent Job‚Äù Program‚Äôs (MPED) principal objective is to increase labor force
insertion and improve employability among youth. It is directed at men and women between
the ages of 18 and 24 that have completed primary school in the public system and/or schools
with an Agreement with the public system, have limited resources, are from urban and
suburban areas, and are unemployed.

In order for a young person to be considered eligible for the program, he or she must have a
per capita family income below the poverty line                            3   and meet one of the following
requirements:

    ‚Ä¢     Electricity consumption per family. The government has determined that households
          with consumption equal to or less than 70 kWh per month are charged a ‚ÄúDignity‚Äù
          rate because they are considered to be low-income families. Consequently, youth that

   ‚Ä¢   Type of educational institution. The Bolivian Government has established that the
       Juancito Pinto Grant will be directed to children that study in state educational
       institutions or those that have agreements with the state, with the assumption that
       these institutions provide services to low-income families. This government-defined
       criterion is one of those adopted by the Program. Consequently, youth from state
       secondary schools or those with an agreement with the state meet the eligibility
       criteria established by the Program.

Implementation of the program began as a pilot in five cities (El Alto, La Paz, Santa Cruz de la
Sierra, Cochabamba, and Montero) in 2009 and was extended to mid-2010, reaching a total
of 2,562 beneficiaries. Following an evaluation process with an eye toward beginning the
expansion phase, the program‚Äôs design was modified, coverage was expanded to the cities of
Tarija and Sucre and the management of the program in Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Montero
was combined.

The expansion phase was finally launched at the beginning of 2012 and was expected to be
completed in the first semester of 2015, with a total of 1,400 young people trained. Beginning
in July 2015, the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security (MTEPS) will launch a
third phase of the program, increasing coverage to the nine departmental capital cities and
Ciudad del Alto, in addition to 5 medium-sized cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants.
During the next 5 years, the program is expected to provide 1,200 beneficiaries per year with
basic and intermediate technical degrees.

In budget terms, even though the program received budget increases throughout the period,
with the most significant in 2014, its implementations capabilities were weak. On average it
has not surpassed an annual execution of more than 50% of its resources.

IV.   Analysis of the effectiveness of the programs‚Äô targeting mechanisms
            4.1 Juancito Pinto Grant (BJP)

 In the case of the BJP, two analyses of the targeting mechanism were performed utilizing the
 2012 Household Survey. First, the program‚Äôs exclusion errors were analyzed, and secondly
 we evaluated whether or not the categorical selection criterion showed a relationship with
 the beneficiary household‚Äôs socioeconomic status.

 Analysis of targeting errors in the BJP. The program‚Äôs target population is students under
 age 18 that are enrolled in the first 8 years of formal education in public educational
 institutions and private institutions with agreements with the state. Table 4.1 shows the
 distribution of beneficiaries by the type of educational institution they attend.

According to the information provided by the 2012 ECH, the majority of the program‚Äôs
beneficiaries attend public institutions, while less than 10% attend private schools with
agreements.

With the goal of determining if the program is making exclusion errors, Table 4.2 presents
the distribution of students under age 18 that have studied up to the eighth year of formal
education, according to whether or not they receive the BJP transfer.

The results presented in Table 3 suggest the existence of some 18.7% of students up to the
eighth grade in state institutions and 24.4% of those that attend private schools with state
agreements that do not receive the BJP‚Äôs cash transfer.

Analysis of the incidence of poverty in the BJP. Even though it is not explicitly explained in
the law that created the program, it is possible that the categorical selection related to the
presence of state funding in the schools that are the target of the program is related to the

objective of incentivizing the accumulation of human capital among the population that
attends those schools. Additionally, it is assumed that the population that attends public
schools or private ones with state agreements is poor and requires this type of incentive for
the formation of human capital. Table 4 shows the incidence of poverty among students
under age 18 by the type of educational institution that they attend.

                          Source: Authors‚Äô elaboration based on the ECH (2012)

Although the incidence of poverty among students at public institutions and private
institutions with state agreements is greater than that among private institutions, there is a
high percentage of non-poor students in those institutions. In effect, some 41.2% of the
students at state schools and 59.4% of those that attend schools that have agreements with
the state are not poor. Figure 4.1 shows that the presence of BJP beneficiaries among the
above 60 percent of the income distribution in private institutions with agreements is much
important than in public institutions. Finally, the use of public funding at schools as a proxy
of poverty, leads to inclusion errors based on the mechanism‚Äôs design, especially for private
schools with agreements, and to exclusion errors as almost 20% of students in private
institutions is poor.

In conclusion, if one assumes that the objective of the BJP is to support poor children so that
they complete their secondary education, then the targeting mechanism, based on its design,
creates inclusion errors (non-poor children that attend public schools or those with state
agreements) as well as exclusion errors (poor children that attend private schools).

           4.2 . Juana Azurduy Mother-Child Grant (BJA)

Just as we performed with the Juancito Pinto Grant, in this section we undertake an
evaluation of the application of the program‚Äôs targeting mechanisms and an analysis of the
incidence of poverty.

under age two, while the remaining 11.6% do not have children. Of the total number of
women in the latter group, 26.4% of them are pregnant and thus eligible for the grant.

With the goal of obtaining a better understanding of the profile of the program‚Äôs
beneficiaries, Table 4.5 presents the distribution of beneficiary women in the Juana Azurduy
Grant program by the type of healthcare coverage they have.

Of the total number of beneficiaries, 81.9% do not have short-term coverage, while 8.8% are
covered by social security in health. In addition, 7.8% of the women beneficiaries have health
insurance from the departmental governments. Finally, 1.5% of beneficiaries state that they
have private healthcare coverage. These latter three categories of coverage signal clear
inclusion errors. Although this inclusion error is small, concerns emerge related to the failings
of the operational mechanisms of the categorical selection tool, inasmuch as it is not possible
to clearly identify the type of coverage that some beneficiaries enjoy.

Keeping the eligibility criteria around the coverage of social security in health is a good proxy
to the households‚Äô level of poverty. Table 4.6 shows the distribution of women according to
their level of poverty and the type of health coverage they have and it ratifies a strong
correlation between the lack of health coverage and poverty. In effect, of the individuals that
belong to poor households, one observes that 83% do not have health coverage.

However, the table also shows a strong correlation between the lack of coverage and not
being poor, with almost 62% of the non-poor also not having healthcare coverage. These
results suggest that the use of the category of no healthcare coverage could also create an
inclusion error based on the mechanism‚Äôs design.

Based on these values, if one adds a household‚Äôs level of poverty to the categorical eligibility
criteria, then the exclusion error is 33.5% and the inclusion error is 10.7%. In terms of the first
error, it is associated with the program‚Äôs operational problems, insomuch as it does not
manage to reach the entire population of potentially eligible individuals. Figure 4.2 shows
that almost 23% of beneficiaries of the BJA of the third quintile of income distribution, a
population group that is vulnerable and eventually only exceeds the poverty line after
receiving a transfer from the program. Finally, the existence of 25% of beneficiaries in the
two highest quintiles of income distribution could be explained by the inclusion errors
created by the lack of objective mechanism of verifying the coverage of social security in
health (the program uses self declaration instead of cross data base checking).

            4.3 . My First Decent Job (MPED)

The ‚ÄúMy First Decent Job‚Äù Program‚Äôs principal objective is to increase labor insertion and
improve employability of young people. It is aimed at men and women between the ages of
18 and 24 that have completed primary school in public schools or those with agreements
with the state, have low income, are from urban and suburban areas, and are unemployed.

As was mentioned previously, an individual targeting mechanism based on simple means
testing is applied which combines a self-declared household income with the presentation of
an energy bill or demonstration of attendance at a public educational institution. The


                                                - 22 -
program‚Äôs eligibility limits are a per capita income below the poverty line and household
energy consumption below 70 kWh.

Due to the impossibility of identifying the beneficiaries via the ongoing household survey, the
following paragraphs present an approximation of the target population based on estimating
electricity expenditure, the type of educational institution that young persons attended, and
their level of poverty.

Household expenditure on electricity associated with consumption less than 70 kWh per
month is calculated based on the information presented in Table 4.8:

                            Table 4.8. Rate table for electricity consumption 4

Based on this information, consumption of 70 kWh is equivalent to:

                 Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ ,Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê‚â§70 = ($22.420 + 50Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•$0.065 + 20Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•$0.414)Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1.15 = Ì†µÌ∞µÌ†µÌ∞µÌ†µÌ∞µÌ†µÌ∞µ40

A household that spends up to Bs40 per month would be consuming less than 70 kWh during
said period. Based on this calculation, and with information from the ECH (2012), it is possible
to identify those households that consume less than 70 kWh per month.

Among the young people that are below the poverty line, some 45.8% attend/attended a
public educational institution and consume less than 70 kWh of electricity; 0.2% only
consumed less electricity than the established parameter; and 51.4% only attended a formal
public educational institution.

These results suggest that the probability of committing an exclusion error is not significant
from the point of view of the design of the eligibility requirements, to the extent that the
majority of young people living in poverty also meet at least one of the other two
requirements. Nonetheless, this mechanism contains some risks. On one hand, it could create
an exclusion error, if a phenomenon of stigmatization of poverty were to present itself. This
has a greater probability of occurring in geographic areas with heterogeneous income levels.
On the other hand, an inclusion error could occur if there were incentives to understate
income. With this in mind, given that a large proportion of non-poor young people (85.5%)




                                              - 24 -
 meet at least one of the other requirements, there could be incentives to understate
 household per capita income.

 In this context, and considering institutional capabilities, one alternative in order to avoid
 these risks is to utilize records for means testing. Having recognized this possibility, in the
 future the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security has decided to use the results
 of the Single Registry of Beneficiaries targeting mechanism implemented by the Ministry of
 Development Planning for the Program. The next section analyzes the general characteristics
 of the Registry and its potential to be used in Bolivia‚Äôs social protection programs.

V.    Estimation of inclusion and exclusion errors in the new Single Registry of Beneficiaries

 With the goal of improving the quality and coverage of the current and future registries of
 beneficiaries of social programs in Bolivia, the Ministry of Development Planning, through the
 Unit for Analysis of Social and Economic Policies (UDAPE), developed a targeting mechanism
 known as the Single Registry of Beneficiaries (RUB) that utilizes the means testing method.
 The Ministry of Development Planning aims to reach agreements with the social programs
 operated by the various Ministries that utilize beneficiary selection mechanisms based on
 vulnerability and/or poverty. Following the example of other countries, such as Peru‚Äôs
 Household Selection System (SISFOH) and Colombia‚Äôs Social Program Potential Beneficiary
 Identification System (SISBEN), a single, poverty-based targeting mechanism allows for
 selection criteria to be standardized, reducing identification costs and improving the final
 results of the targeting process.

 The development of the RUB represents a planning and monitoring tool that would allow
 policymakers to create a database of households and their members based on their
 demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in order to categorize households according
 to their level of poverty. The demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are collected
 through a survey carried out in a census of households located in specific areas of the country.

 The RUB uses a probit model in order to estimate the probability that an individual/household
 will be below the poverty line as a function of the data collected by the RUB survey. The



                                              - 25 -
objective is not just to determine the significance of the collected variables, but also to
establish an estimate of the potential exclusion and inclusion errors that could occur.

The regressors to be considered are divided into 3 groups of variables:

  i.    Personal characteristics: age, gender with a value of one if the individual is male,
        educational level, and employment status.
  ii.   Characteristics of the residence: urban/rural, residential property, principal material
        used in the walls.
 iii.   Household characteristics: mobile and fixed telephone ownership, household
        members per room.

In order to evaluate the significance of the variables and the potential inclusion and exclusion
errors, we utilized data from the Ongoing Household Survey (ECH) from 2012. The survey‚Äôs
objective is to generate and follow indicators on the incidence of poverty, wellbeing, and the
population‚Äôs living conditions. The survey is performed at a national level, covering both
urban and rural areas. Therefore, the study population included the sum of all private
residences and their occupants in urban and rural areas of the country.

Taking into consideration the demographic and socioeconomic variables from the RUB, we
performed a multivariate analysis designed to estimate the probability of belonging to a poor
household as a function of this set of characteristics.

The estimates undertaken show a good regression adjustment, with a success ratio
equivalent to 69%. As was expected, the educational level is negatively associated with the
probability of being poor. Similarly, the number of household members per room positively
affects the likelihood of poverty. On the other hand, those households that reside in urban
areas and have fixed line and/or mobile telephone service are the households with the least
probability of falling below the poverty line.

People‚Äôs economic status significantly affects the probability that they are poor in terms of
income. In effect, being employed or unemployed has a lesser or greater impact on poverty,
respectively, in relation to inactivity.



                                                 - 26 -
Finally, the effects of home ownership are not so clear. The estimator of the dummy variable
that takes a value of one if the household residence is owned turns out to be statistically
significant and positive in terms of explaining the probability of being poor. Although this
result is counterintuitive, it is associated with the low variability of this characteristic among
the study population.

 Based on this theoretical exercise, we estimate that the design of the RUB generates an
 inclusion error of 19.1% and an exclusion error of 11.9%. The exposure to these kinds of errors
 is always present. Policymakers‚Äô efforts focus on minimizing their presence, and this is
 dependent on the number and type of characteristics that are gathered in order to
 approximate the state of income poverty.

 The definition of the target population based on its level of income poverty, requires some
 mechanisms other than self-declaration in order to eliminate the risk of understatement. In
 general, means testing mechanisms gather a set of characteristics related to the household,
 the residence, and the members that make it up, and this is actually one of the causes of the
 existence of these kinds of errors. In that regard, the characteristics of the residence, the
 building materials for example, are aspects that are more linked to the concept of structural
 poverty or to unmet basic needs (NBI) than to a lack of resources. In general, the correlation
 between the direct and indirect concepts of poverty is not one-to-one, due to the fact that a
 lack of resources does not necessarily mean there are unmet needs, given that goods and
 services can come from public, family, accumulated capital sources.

 Nonetheless, this exercise is a theoretical approximation of the potentially achievable results
 with this mechanism based on a probit model. The final calibration of the mechanism should
 be performed when it is put to use with a significant group of beneficiaries.

VI.       Conclusions and future challenges

 The Plurinational State of Bolivia launched the BJP, BJA, and MPED programs in 2006. They
 are designed to promote the accumulation of human capital among households and improve
 employability. The three programs are directed toward well-defined population groups and
 present specific eligibility requirements. With the exception of the MPED, the programs‚Äô goals
 do not explicitly include covering the poor population. However, given that the challenges



                                                  - 28 -
that the BJP and BJA aim to cover are strongly correlated with a household‚Äôs poverty level
(secondary school desertion, infant malnutrition, and a lack of access to healthcare services),
in this paper we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the targeting mechanisms for
covering the poor population. In order to do this, we evaluated the inclusion and exclusion
errors resulting from applying the mechanisms to the general population and to the
programs‚Äô beneficiaries.

The inclusion and exclusion errors from the BJP and BJA are moderate when the effectiveness
of the design of the identification mechanism is evaluated. If one assumes that the objective
of the BJP is to support poor children to complete their secondary education, then the
targeting mechanism, based on its design, generates inclusion errors (non-poor children that
attend public schools or private schools with state agreements at a rate between 40% and
60% approximately) and exclusion errors (poor children that attend private schools at a rate
near 15%). In turn, the BJA, which considers not just the type of health insurance that the
beneficiary has, but also her level of poverty, generates a potential inclusion error of 10% and
an exclusion error of 33%.

Meanwhile, in the case of the MPED the probability of committing an exclusion error is not
significant in terms of the design of the eligibility requirements insomuch as the majority of
young people living in poverty also meet at least one of the other two targeting requirements
(formal education in the public system or a private school with a state agreement and
household electricity consumption at the social rate level). In any case, the mechanism
contains some risk of generating inclusion errors associated with the household income level
requirement because incentives to understate income could exist, especially within the group
of non-poor young people that meets the selection criteria (some 85% of non-poor youth
meet at least one of these requirements).

Keeping in mind the limitations of identifying the poor population as demonstrated by the
mechanisms evaluated in the three programs, one notes a future opportunity to begin to use
the results of the means testing selection mechanism developed under the auspices of the
Single Registry of Beneficiaries (RUB), as implemented by the Ministry of Development


                                             - 29 -
Planning (MPD). This tool attempts to obtain an estimate of individuals‚Äô level of income
poverty, according to a set of characteristics related to their residences, households, and
household members. The results of an initial evaluation of the tool‚Äôs effectiveness have
shown low inclusion and exclusion errors‚Äîfewer than those generated by the current
mechanisms.

The MPD is in the process of collecting household data and is beginning to reach agreements
with the various social programs so they can use this targeting mechanism. Accordingly, the
MPED decided to utilize the results of the RUB once it has covered the program‚Äôs target cities.
Subsequent agreements with other social programs will improve their effectiveness in terms
of targeting, while at the same time increasing their efficiency by decreasing the cost of
beneficiary selection.

Clearly, this entails a very significant qualitative change, insofar as the use of the RUB involves
explicitly stating the poverty level as an eligibility criterion for social protection transfer
programs.

Abstract

As part of the 2006‚Äì2011 National Development Plan, the Plurinational State of Bolivia
launched two cash transfer programs and one youth labor training program aimed at promoting
the accumulation of households‚Äô human capital: the Juancito Pinto Educational Grant, the
Juana Azurduy Mother-Child Grant, and My First Decent Job. The objective of this paper is to
analyze the effectiveness of the targeting mechanisms utilized in these programs. Based on the
information provided by the Ongoing Household Survey, we estimate the mechanisms‚Äô potential
inclusion and exclusion errors. The results permit us to suggest that the categorical selection
mechanisms used in the three programs are effective in reaching the poorest population,
although they present distinct levels of inclusion and exclusion errors associated with both the
design and implementation problems of the particular mechanism utilized.

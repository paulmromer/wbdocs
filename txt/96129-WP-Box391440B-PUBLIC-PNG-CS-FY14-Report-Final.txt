II. Methodology
From April to May 2014, 463 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Papua New Guinea were
invited to provide their opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the country by
participating in a country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the
President; the office of the Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian;
ministries, ministerial departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working
on World Bank Group-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs)
overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and
other organizations. A total of 150 stakeholders participated in the survey (32% response rate).
Respondents either completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency or they
received the questionnaire via courier and returned it accordingly. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing PNG; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG);
the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with
the WBG; the WBG’s sectoral focus in the PNG, the WBG’s future role in PNG; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing in PNG.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Papua New Guinea: Respondents were asked to indicate whether
   PNG is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
   and generating economic growth in PNG, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
   achieved in PNG.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their
   familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Papua New Guinea, WBG staff
   preparedness to help PNG solve its development challenges, their agreement with various
   statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued): development partner.
   Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most
   effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in PNG, with which stakeholder groups the
   WBG should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus most of its
   resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what reasons respondents attributed
   failed or slow reform efforts. Respondents were also asked to respond to a few questions
   about capacity building, whether they believe the WBG should have more or less local
   presence and more or effective collaboration with the UN.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in PNG, the extent to which the
   WBG meets PNG’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the WBG’s
   level of effectiveness across twenty three development areas, such as education, public sector
   governance/reform, transport, and job creation/employment.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. They
   were also asked to indicate whether they think the WBG should take more risk in PNG and
   whether the WBG is adequately staffed in PNG.
F. The World Bank Group’s Sectoral Focus in PNG: Respondents were asked to indicate which
   areas the WBG would be most valuable in related to sustainable development of mining
   sector, the oil and gas sector, and sustainable development of minerals revenues.
G. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in PNG: Respondents were asked to indicate what
   the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in PNG, and which services the Bank
   should offer more of in the country, and what the WBG should do to improve its
   collaboration with the UN in the field. They were also asked to which areas the country will
   benefit most from WBG playing a leading role as compared to other donors.
H. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement that they use
   more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
I. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in PNG, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 81 respondents (54% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2003. For more details, please see Appendix E (page 140).

        similar ratings (6.8) for twenty seven indicator questions as respondents who do not
        professionally collaborate/work with the WBG (6.4)

         Consultants/Contractors working on WBG projects and respondents from PMUs were
         significantly more likely to indicate so than other stakeholder groups.
        Nearly half of the respondents indicated that failed or slow WBG-assisted reforms should
         be attributed to inefficient Government. Among all stakeholders, respondents from the
         media were significantly more likely to indicate so than other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Papua New Guinea,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty three
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Papua New Guinea. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at energy;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at crime and violence;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at local governance and sub-national institutions; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at domestic private sector development.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Papua New Guinea, suggesting that
        ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
        ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
        these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at transport;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at domestic private sector development;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at crime and violence.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates (continued)
The World Bank Group as an Effective Development Partner (continued)
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings for the WBG “being
        a long-term partner.? Respondents from the media and employees of
        ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies tended to give the highest
        ratings, whereas respondents from PMUs and consultants/contractors working on WBG
        projects tended to give significantly lower ratings (see Appendix B for details).
       Three were significant differences between geographic locations in respondents’ ratings
        for three qualities of the WBG being an effective development partner. These qualities
        are “being inclusive,? “collaboration with groups outside the Government,? and
        “collaboration with other donors.? Respondents from the Port Moresby (National Capital
        District) had significantly higher ratings for these qualities of the WBG than respondents
        from other geographic locations.
       Respondents who professionally collaborate/work with the WBG had significantly higher
        ratings for the WBG’s “openness,? and “staff accessibility? compared to respondents who
        do not professionally collaborate/work with the WBG.

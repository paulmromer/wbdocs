I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Mali perceive the World Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Mali regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Mali;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Mali;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
               Mali;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Mali.
       Use data to help inform Mali country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In May 2014, 751 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Mali were invited to provide their
opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial
departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working on World Bank
Group-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 260 stakeholders participated in the survey (35% response rate).
Respondents received the questionnaire via post or courier and returned it accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Mali; their overall attitudes toward the
World Bank Group (WBG); the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work
and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Mali; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing in Mali.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Mali: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Mali is headed in
   the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important development
   priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Mali, and how “shared prosperity? would be best achieved in
   Mali.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Mali, WBG staff preparedness to
   help Mali solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the
   most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Mali, with which stakeholder groups
   the WBG should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus most of its
   resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what reasons respondents attributed
   failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Mali, the extent to which the
   WBG meets Mali’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the WBG’s
   level of effectiveness across thirty-five development areas, such as economic growth,
   governance, job creation, health, education, agriculture and rural development.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Mali: Respondents were asked to indicate what
   the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Mali, which services the WBG should
   offer more of in the country, and which development areas would benefit most from WBG
   playing a leading role as compared to other donors.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites and social
   media channels. Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Mali, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 365 respondents (56% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2007 and 176 respondents (75% response rate) who completed the country survey in FY
2002. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of respondents from the office of the President,
        Prime Minister were combined with respondents from the office of a minister;
        respondents from PMUs and consultants/contractors working on World Bank Group-
        supported projects/programs were combined with employees of ministries; respondents
        from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector
        organizations; respondents from NGOs, community based organizations, trade unions,
        faith-based groups, and private foundations were combined into the “CSO? category; and
        the few respondents from the office of a parliamentarian, bilateral agencies, multilateral
        agencies, independent government institutions, and the judiciary branch were included in
        the “Other? category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Area of Primary Specialization




    When more than 15% of the sample are respondents from a particular sector (see the full list of specialized
    areas in question H2 in Appendix I), analyses are done to see these respondents’ views about the development
    priorities in Mali, the areas of development that would contribute most to poverty reduction and economic
    growth, which areas the WBG should focus its attention and resources on, and importance and effectiveness of
    the WBG’s work in specific sectors.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location
       The majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Bamako.
       Because of the small number of respondents from Koulikoro, these respondents were
        combined with respondents from Bamako for all further analyses.
       Note that there were no respondents from Kidal and Tombouctou.
       Responses across all geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found
        in Appendix C (see page 96).
       Only significant differences between geographic locations in response to indicator
        questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Respondents from the office of President/Prime Minister/Minister had the highest levels
        of familiarity with the WBG whereas respondents from the media and academia/research
        institutes/think tanks had significantly lower levels of familiarity.

        with the WBG in Mali compared to respondents from the FY ’07 country survey (4.2)
        and significantly lower levels of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from
        the FY ’02 country survey (6.7).

        with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Mali, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with their perceptions of the WBG’s relevance to Mali’s
        development, and the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Mali.

       There were statistically significant differences across stakeholder groups in their ratings
        of the WBG’s effectiveness across seven of these thirty-five development areas in Mali.
        For the most part, respondents from the office of President/Prime Minister/Minister and
        local governments tended to give the highest ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness,
        whereas respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks and the media
        tended to give significantly lower ratings. Ratings across all development areas by
        stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 74). Those areas with
        significant stakeholder group differences were:
             “Economic growth?;
             “Food security?;
             “Communicable/non-communicable diseases?;
             “Global/regional integration?;
             “Climate change?;
             “Trade and exports?; and
             “Financial markets?.
       Respondents who collaborate/work with the WBG gave significantly higher effectiveness
        ratings for “Local governance and institutions? and “Gender equity? compared to
        respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG. Ratings across all areas by level of
        collaboration can be found in Appendix D (see page 114).
       Respondents from the agriculture/rural development/food security sector gave
        statistically similar effectiveness ratings for “Rural development?, “Agricultural
        development?, and “Food security? compared to respondents from other sectors. Ratings
        across all areas by sectors can be found in Appendix E (see page 132).

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Mali, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Mali. The areas determined
        to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at social cohesion;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at food security; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Mali, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment;

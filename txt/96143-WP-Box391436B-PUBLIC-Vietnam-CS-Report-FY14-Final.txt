I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Vietnam
        perceive the World Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Vietnam regarding:
             Their views regarding the general environment in Vietnam;
             Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Vietnam;
             Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results,
              project/program related issues, knowledge work and activities, and
              communication and information sharing in Vietnam; and
             Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Vietnam.

       Use data to help inform Vietnam country team’s strategy.




II. Methodology
From March to April 2014, 1,032 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Vietnam were
invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Paper questionnaires were sent to 907 potential respondents via post, with
follow-up emails, and another 125 potential respondents received questionnaires via email.
Questionnaires were completed and returned via post, telephone, or email. A total of 501
questionnaires were completed (49% response rate).

Participants in the survey were drawn from among the National Government; the National
Assembly; project management units (PMUs); local government officials or staff; bilateral or
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; NGOs; the media; and academia/research
institutes/think tanks.

Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Vietnam; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the Bank’s future role in Vietnam; and the Bank’s communication and
information sharing in Vietnam. In addition, every country that engages in the Country Survey
must include specific indicator questions that will be aggregated for the WBG’s annual
Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

II. Methodology (continued)
A. General Issues Facing Vietnam: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Vietnam is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the three most important development
   priorities, and what would best achieve “shared prosperity? in Vietnam.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their
   familiarity with the WBG, its effectiveness in Vietnam, Bank staff preparedness, to what
   extent it should provide capacity building support to certain groups, their agreement with
   various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which it is an effective
   development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values and
   greatest weaknesses, and with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent
   to which the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Vietnam, the extent to which
   the Bank meets Vietnam’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across twenty-four development areas.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult Bank knowledge work and to rate the quality of the
   Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes
   to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which various
   aspects of the Bank’s technical assistance/advisory work contributes to solving Vietnam’s
   development challenges and their level of agreement with a series of statements regarding
   working with the Bank. Respondents were also asked to indicate if the Bank operates with
   too much risk.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Vietnam: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Vietnam.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, their awareness of the Bank’s
   Access to Information policy, and their usage of the Bank’s websites. Respondents were also
   asked to rate their agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s communication
   and information sharing in Vietnam.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they currently collaborate with the WBG in Vietnam, their exposure
   to the Bank in Vietnam, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s survey were
compared to responses from the 335 respondents (46% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY ’10 and the 279 respondents (43% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY ’06. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, the one respondent from the National Assembly was combined with
        respondents from the National Government and the few respondents from the private
        sector were included in the “Other? category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Geographic Location

       The vast majority of respondents were from Ha Noi. Because of the small number of
        respondents from Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and Can Tho, they were combined into
        one “Outside Ha Noi? category for all further location comparisons. Only significant
        geographic location differences in ratings of indicator questions will be discussed in the
        body of this report. All geographic locations comparisons can be found in the Appendix
        (see page 67).

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Familiarity with the World Bank Group

       Respondents’ familiarity with the World Bank Group in Vietnam in this country survey
        was significantly lower compared to that of respondents in the FY ’10 country survey (7.2).
       Respondents from PMUs, local government, and the National Government/Assembly had
        the highest levels of familiarity with the World Bank Group in Vietnam whereas
        respondents from academia, NGOs, and other organizations had significantly lower levels
        of familiarity.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the World Bank Group were significantly,
        strongly correlated with their perceptions of the World Bank Group’s overall
        effectiveness in Vietnam and significantly, moderately correlated to perceptions of the
        World Bank Group’s ability to help achieve development results and that the World Bank
        Group currently plays a relevant role in development in Vietnam.

IV. General Issues Facing Vietnam

Vietnam Heading in the Right Direction

       The majority of respondents across most stakeholder groups indicated that Vietnam is
        headed in the right direction, except respondents from NGOs and the media who were
        significantly more likely to indicate indicated that they were not sure whether Vietnam
        was headed in the right or wrong direction.

IV. General Issues Facing Vietnam (continued)

Achieving “Shared Prosperity?

       Although respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that consistent economic
        growth, greater voice and participation for citizens, and education/training would best
        achieve “shared prosperity?, respondents from bilateral or multilateral agencies were
        more likely to indicate better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
As noted in the “Methodology? section, the indicator questions referred to throughout the survey
report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Survey. These
will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.


The World Bank Group’s Overall Effectiveness (Indicator Question)

       Respondents’ ratings for the World Bank Group’s effectiveness in this country survey
        were statistically similar to those of respondents in the FY ’10 country survey (7.7).
       Respondents from PMUs, local government, and National Government/Assembly gave
        the highest ratings for the World Bank Group’s effectiveness in Vietnam and for the
        extent to which the World Bank’s work achieves development results in Vietnam
        whereas respondents from NGOs gave significantly lower ratings.
       Respondents from Outside Ha Noi gave significantly higher ratings for the World Bank
        Group’s effectiveness in Vietnam and for the extent to which the World Bank’s work
        achieves development results in Vietnam compared to respondents from Ha Noi.
       Respondents who collaborated with the WBG gave significantly higher ratings for the
        World Bank Group’s effectiveness in Vietnam and for the extent to which the World

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)

WBG Activities: Greatest Value

       Respondents in the FY ’10 country survey indicated that the Bank’s greatest values to
        Vietnam were the Bank’s financial resources (56%) and its knowledge (45%).
       Although respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that the Bank’s financial
        resources and its policy advice were its greatest values, respondents from the media were
        more likely to indicate that convening/facilitating was the Bank’s greatest value.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Greatest Weakness
       Respondents in the FY ’10 country survey indicated that the Bank’s greatest weakness in
        its work in Vietnam was imposing technocratic solutions without regard to political
        realities (34%) and not exploring alternative policy options (22%).
       Although respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that the Bank’s greatest
        weaknesses were that its processes are too complex and that it is not willing to honestly
        criticize policies and reform efforts in Vietnam, respondents from the National
        Government/Assembly were more likely to indicate that the WBG’s process being too
        slow was its greatest weakness and respondents from bilateral or multilateral agencies
        were more likely to indicate that the Bank imposing technocratic solutions without regard
        to political realities was its greatest weakness.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)

Capacity Building

       Respondents from the National Government/Assembly, PMUs, local government, and
        other organizations gave the highest ratings for the extent which Vietnam would benefit
        from WBG capacity building support to the public sector, related to implementation of
        specific development projects on the ground, whereas respondents from bilateral or
        multilateral agencies and academia gave significantly lower ratings.
       Respondents from bilateral or multilateral agencies gave the highest ratings for the extent
        which Vietnam would benefit from WBG capacity building support to groups outside of
        government whereas respondents from the National Government/Assembly gave
        significantly lower ratings.

VI. Sectors: Effectiveness (continued)

Effectiveness of Specific Areas (continued)

       Please note the complete breakdown of respondents’ effectiveness ratings for the Bank’s
        work in these development areas can be found in the Appendix. In addition to the
        aggregate mean ratings for each area, respondents who indicated that they “Don’t Know?
        are reported in Appendix A (see page 45), suggesting that primarily informed
        stakeholders responded to these questions. A complete breakdown by stakeholder groups
        can be found in Appendix B (see page 54), by geographic locations in Appendix C (see
        page 67), by WBG-collaborators in Appendix D (see page 77), and by respondents’
        specializations/sectors in Appendix F (see page 89).

       There were statistically significant stakeholder group differences among all but two of
        these twenty-four areas of development. For the most part, respondents from the National
        Government/Assembly and PMUs gave the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness
        across these areas whereas respondents from NGOs and academia tended to give
        significantly lower ratings. Those areas that did not reach statistical significance were:
        “Information and communications technology? and “Trade and exports?.

       Respondents who indicated that they collaborated with the WBG gave higher ratings for
        the Bank’s effectiveness across all of these twenty-four areas of development compared
        to those who indicated that they did not collaborate with the WBG, significantly so for all
        but five areas. Those areas that did not reach statistical significance were: “Law and
        justice?, “Foreign direct investment?, “Social protection?, “Climate change?, and
        “Natural resources management?.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Vietnam, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-four specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Vietnam. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at urban development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at education;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at health; and

        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Vietnam, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at financial markets;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;

        part, respondents from PMUs and local government tended to have the highest levels of
        agreement whereas respondents from bilateral or multilateral agencies tended to have
        significantly lower levels of agreement.

        where country systems are adequate, the WBG makes appropriate use of them, compared
        to respondents from Ha Noi.
       Respondents who collaborated with the WBG had statistically similar levels of agreement
        across all of these aspects compared to those who do not collaborate with the WBG.

        tended to give the highest ratings across these aspects whereas respondents from bilateral
        or multilateral agencies and the media tended to give significantly lower ratings. Those
        areas for which there were not significat differences were: “Flexibility (in terms of
        changing country circumstances)?, “Being inclusive?, and “Collaboration with groups
        outside of the Government?.
       Respondents from Outside Ha Noi had higher ratings across all of these aspects
        compared to respondents from Ha Noi, significantly so for “Being inclusive?,
        “Openness?, and “The speed in which it gets things accomplished on the ground?.

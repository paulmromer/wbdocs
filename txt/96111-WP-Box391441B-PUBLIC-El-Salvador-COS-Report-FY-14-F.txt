II. Methodology
In March-April 2014, 135 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in El Salvador were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President; the office of the Prime
Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial departments, or
implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations;
private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations;
the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 97
stakeholders participated in the survey (72% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned them accordingly. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing El Salvador; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in El Salvador; and the WBG’s communication and information
sharing in El Salvador.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing El Salvador: Respondents were asked to indicate whether El Salvador
   is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
   and generating economic growth in El Salvador, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
   achieved.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG and other regional development banks, their effectiveness in
   El Salvador, WBG staff preparedness to help El Salvador solve its development challenges, ,
   their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which
   the WBG is an effective development partner.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG) (continued):
   Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most
   effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in El Salvador, in which sectoral areas the
   WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts. Respondents were also asked to
   respond to a few questions about capacity building and whether they believe the World Bank
   Group should have more or less local presence.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in El Salvador, the extent to
   which the WBG meets El Salvador’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments,
   the importance for the WBG to be involved in thirty one development areas, and the WBG’s
   level of effectiveness across twenty-eight development areas, such as education, crime and
   violence, public sector governance/reform, poverty reduction, and economic growth.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
   Respondents were also asked about the WBG reports, including if they read/consulted the
   most recent LAC Flagship Report, whether they raised substantive new information, and
   whether they provided them with useful information in terms of work they do.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate WBG’s technical
   assistance/advisory work’s contribution to solving development challenges and their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. They
   were also asked to indicate whether they thing the World Bank Group takes enough risks.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in El Salvador: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in El Salvador, and which
   services the Bank should offer more of in the country. They were asked whether WBG has
   moved to the right direction, and the future role international development cooperation
   should play in El Salvador.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy. Respondents were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value
   of its social media channels, and levels of easiness to find information they needed.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in El Salvador, which WBG agencies they work with, whether IFC and the Bank work
   well together, and their geographic location.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Where the World Bank Group Should Focus its Resources
       Education emerges as not only a top development priority, but also the area where the
        Bank should focus most of its resources according to respondents.
       Respondents whose primarily specialization of work is in “education? (17% of the
        sample) were significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG should focus its attention
        and resources on “education? and “economic growth,? compared to respondents in other
        areas of work.
       However, respondents whose primarily specialization of work is in “education? were
        significantly less likely to indicate that the WBG should focus its attention and resources
        on “public sector governance/reform,? compared to respondents in other areas of work.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
       There were significant stakeholder differences in their ratings for the WBG’s
        effectiveness in several areas. In most cases, respondents from the private sector/financial
        sector/private sector and employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implantation
        agencies tended to give the highest ratings, whereas respondents from independent
        government institutions and academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to give
        significantly lower ratings. These areas of development included:
                      Information and communications technology;
                      Crime and violence;
                      Regulatory framework;
                      Domestic private sector development;
                      Disaster management;
                      Global/regional integration;
                      Food security; and
                      Social protection

       Respondents whose primarily specialization of work is in “education? (17% of all
        respondents) gave significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in the
        following areas, compared to respondents who specialize in other areas:
                      Environmental sustainability;
                      Regulatory framework;
                      Economic growth;
                      Disaster management;
                      Public sector governance/reform;
                      Health;
                      Rural development;
                      Global/regional integration;
                      Food security;
                      Social protection;

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in El Salvador,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty eight
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in El Salvador. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at food security;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at climate change;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at crime and violence;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at trade and exports.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in El Salvador, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption
                The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at crime and violence.

       Respondents from private sector/financial sector/private banks, PMUs, and

        realistic for El Salvador,? whereas respondents from independent government
        institutions and academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to have significantly
        lower levels of agreement with this statement.
       Respondents across stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of agreement with
        all other statements about the WBG’s work in El Salvador including the indicator
        statements.
       Respondents who professionally collaborate/work with WBG tended to have significantly
        higher levels of agreement with the indicator statement that “overall the WBG currently
        plays a relevant role in development in El Salvador,? compared to respondents who do
        not professionally collaborate/work with WBG.

The World Bank Group as an Effective Development Partner
         There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings for two of WBG’s
          qualities as an effective development partner. They are the “the ease of access to the
          people at the WBG who are making decisions important to my work? and “being
          inclusive.? Respondents from ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies
          tended to give the highest ratings, whereas respondents from CSOs tended to give
          significantly lower ratings (see Appendix B for details).

         Respondents who professionally collaborate/work with the WBG had significantly lower
          ratings for the “WBG’s flexibility in terms of changing country circumstances,? compared
          to respondents who do not professionally collaborate/work with the WBG.

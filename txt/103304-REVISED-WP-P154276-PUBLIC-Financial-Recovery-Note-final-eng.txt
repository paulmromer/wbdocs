A.    Background

The power sector of Armenia achieved remarkable results through first generation policy, legal,
regulatory and institutional reforms implemented from 1991-2003, the first decade of
independence. The sector achieved financial sustainability with tariffs that assured recovery of
reasonable expenses and collections that reached virtually 100 percent of sales. The implicit and
explicit subsidies to the power sector were eliminated and the largest sector companies were
among the top taxpayers in the country. More than 70 percent of power sector assets were
denationalized (privatized or transferred to Russian ownership in debt-to-asset swaps). However, in
2010 these achievements started to reverse and gradually worsened during the past several years.
Today, the large state-owned sector power companies, as well as the privately-owned ENA have
accumulated large amount of expensive commercial debts and are on the verge of bankruptcy.

B.      Sector Financial Situation

The state-owned power generation companies are in financial distress and run a sizable financial
deficit. As of February 1, 2016, the state-owned power generation companies (ANPP and YTPC) had
a cash deficit of AMD51 billion1 (0.9% percent of estimated 2015 GDP) or 80% of their total
estimated revenues for 2015.

The swelling debt service requirements were one of the main reasons behind the widening of the
financial gap. As of February 1, 2016, the state-owned power companies had AMD6.5 billions of
short-term and expensive commercial loans and AMD37 billion in payables. The maturities for most
of the loans are below 12 months with annual interest rates of 9%-11.5%. These commercial loans
cost the sector AMD0.7 billion in interest expense per year.

The accumulation of receivables at state-owned companies also contributed to the financial gap.
The state-owned power companies also accumulated significant receivables from privately-owned
ENA, which has struggled to make timely payments for electricity purchased due to its dire financial
condition. The total amount of receivables of the three state-owned companies from ENA
amounted to AMD17.4 billion as of February 1, 2016.

The poor financial performance has led to accumulation of sizable payables. The cash strapped
state-owned power companies have been unable to make timely payments and accumulated
sizable payables. Between 2011 and 2014 the payables of the three companies increased by 67%
totaling AMD46 billion as of the end of 2014. YTPC had the largest payable of AMD 24.3 billion to
Gazprom-Armenia CJSC for gas, which increased to AMD37 billion as of February 1, 2016.

Operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses have also been negatively impacted. The amount of
maintenance and recurrent repair funds allowed in the tariffs of the state-owned power companies
reduced by 31% in real terms from 2008-14 due to inflation. And yet, the actual maintenance and
repair spending of these companies over the period of 2011-14 was 67% below the amount
allocated in the tariffs.

C.      Financial Situation of State-Owned Power Sector Companies

        a) Armenian Nuclear Power Plant

In 2011-2014, the level of short-term liquidity to meet its current liabilities dropped due to
significant increase in loans and borrowings. As a result of eroding equity due to continuous
operating losses, the debt-to-equity ratio doubled. As of the end of 2014, about 30% of outstanding
debt were loans from local commercial banks. Despite the fact that upward revision of the power
tariff for ANPP raised the cash return on assets of ANPP, rapid accumulation of debt led to decrease
in debt service coverage ratio.

        b) Yerevan Thermal Power Centre

In 2011-2013, YTPC had deterioration over almost all measures of operating performance,
profitability and liquidity. Worsening of profitability was driven by narrowing margin on total sales
of electricity, natural gas and capacity. Liquidity reduction was primarily due to fast build-up of
payables and short-term liabilities to Vorotan HPP. Despite its power tariff increase by about 45%
in 2014, YTPC struggled to generate enough cash to meet its current liabilities.

The company’s debt-to-capital ratio decreased, which was largely attributable to fixed asset
revaluation gain in 2012 due to favorable changes in the foreign exchange rate. However, cash
based debt and interest coverage deteriorated. The cash shortage to meet its debt service
requirements was covered with borrowings from Vorotan HPP and commercial bank loans. As of
the end of 2014, almost all of long-term debt (about 87%) consisted of borrowing from Japanese
Bank for International Cooperation under Yerevan CCGT project. The rest was commercial loans
from Ardshininvestbank and a long-term borrowing from Vorotan HPP.

        c) High Voltage Networks of Armenia

In 2011-2014, HVEN had varied operating performance. The transmission tariff decrease in 2012
had an adverse effect on profitability. Short-term commercial bank loans and borrowings taken to
fill the cash shortage caused by a significant revenue reduction in 2012 led to deterioration in
already very low liquidity. The share of debt in total capital increased, followed by declining
interest and debt coverage. As of the end of 2014, 93% of total outstanding long term debts are
donor loans from the World Bank and KfW. The rest were borrowings from Vorotan HPP.

D.         Reasons behind Financial Distress of the Power Sector

The expanding financing gap is due to: (a) incurring expenses and lending/borrowing for non-core
business related activities; (b) non-payments by ENA; and (c) below-cost recovery tariffs.

Non-core business related borrowing, lending and expenses. The Government used the funds of
the state-owned power companies to finance some recurrent expenses, basic O&M and salaries of
the Nairit and Vanadzor chemical plants. The Government also mandated the state-owned
companies to borrow funds and on-lend to these chemical plants. The state-owned companies
were able to make such lending by reducing their spending on required O&M and repairs; and
taking short-term and high-interest loans from commercial banks. As of February 1, 2016, the total
outstanding debt 2 of Nairit and Vanadzor chemical plants to Vorotan and Yerevan TPP was
AMD35.6 billion. Moreover, YTPC took AMD2.6 billion loan to lend to Nairit chemical plant.

In addition, the power sector entities incurred several large expenses unrelated to their core
business activities. Specifically:
    (a) Following 30% increase of end-user gas tariffs in 2012, the Government introduced life-line
        gas subsidies for the poor families involved in the Poverty Family Benefit Program. The tariff
        for poor families was set at AMD100/m3 for the first 300m3 of gas consumed compared to
        the regular tariff of AMD156/m3. The state-owned power companies were mandated to
        finance the subsidy, which cost the sector AMD1.1 billion in 2012-13. Vorotan financed the
        cost of the gas subsidy through the return on assets allowed in its tariff.
    (b) Over AMD2.6 billion for other non-core business related expenditures.

(i)     Inadequate mechanism for compensating exogenously caused losses of ENA. ENA is the
single buyer in the power market and its tariff is the difference between the end-user electricity
tariff (one-part tariff) and the capacity charge of generating plants (fixed charge that most of
2
    Loans + interest + payables.

                                                           6
generators receive irrespective of the generation volume to recover their fixed costs), weighted
average cost of the energy charge of generating plants (kWh based charge), transmission charge,
and the service fees of the power system operator and the settlement center. Thus, if the actual
consumption is lower than the volume planned under the tariffs, or the share of expensive
generation plants is larger than that planned under the tariffs, ENA incurs a loss. As per the current
regulatory approach, that loss is recovered in equal installments in three years and it does not
include compensation for interest costs ENA incurs to finance the working capital until the losses
are compensated. Due to substantial deviation of planned vs. actual generation mix in 2012-14, the
Bank team estimates3 that ENA incurred a cumulative loss of around AMD30 billion despite 40%
increase of average end-user tariffs in 2012-2014. ENA had to rely on short-term commercial loans
to finance the shortage of working capital resulting from this loss. The Bank team estimates that
short-term liabilities of ENA have increased by over AMD35 billion in 2012-14.

(ii)    Absence of mechanism for adjustment of natural gas purchase related costs of thermal
power plants: Historically, there has been no compensation of losses of YTPC and Hrazdan TPP
incurred due increase of gas costs driven by depreciation of local currency (AMD). This jeopardizes
financial sustainability because gas costs account for almost 85% of the total costs of those thermal
power plants. The gas tariff for thermal power plants is fixed in US$ and the entities pay the local
currency equivalent using the AMD/US$ official exchange rate of the Central Bank of Armenia as of
the 25th of the month preceding the billing month. Therefore, if US$ appreciates relative to local
currency, then the actual price paid by the above thermal power plants increases. Historically,
when the thermal plants submitted tariff review filings to PSRC, the PSRC used to reject
compensation of additional gas costs incurred for the reason of depreciation of local currency. For
example, since April 2014, YTPC and Hrazdan TPP incurred a combined loss of US$5 million, which
were not compensated during June 2015 tariff increase. Those losses had to be absorbed by the
entities with very limited return on assets and depreciation expenses.

                                 Box 1. Tariff setting methodology in Armenia
 The Armenian multi-sectoral regulator, the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC) relies on what
 is known as a “rate-of-return? or “cost-plus? tariff regime to determine the allowed revenue of the
 power companies. Under this regime, the revenue that the operators are allowed to collect is expected
 to cover:
         eligible costs related to licensed activities,
         asset depreciation and
         an allowed return on invested capital.
 Eligible costs include operating and maintenance costs, fuel costs (for thermal and nuclear plants), tax
 expenses, other than profit tax and VAT, and other state duties and costs envisaged by RA legislation. In
 case of nuclear power plants, eligible costs shall also include costs related to storage of nuclear fuel,
 creation of power plant decommissioning fund and safety enhancement measures.
 Annual depreciation of fixed assets is calculated using a linear method based on historical value of fixed
 assets and their useful life.
 Allowed return is calculated as a product of return base and allowed rate of return. Return base is the
 value of net assets which equals to the sum of the value of non-current assets recognized by PSRC as
 useful and operational, net of accumulated depreciation, and the allowed amount of working capital.
 Allowed rate of return is defined as a weighted average cost of capital.
 Depending on types of services provided to the power system, power generation companies may have
 different tariff structures: one-part and two-part. One-part tariffs are set for generating plants the
 operating regime of which is not regulated by the power system operator, such as unregulated
 hydropower plants, wind plants and other renewable resource based power plants, which do not offer
 systemic services other than power generation. One-part tariff is determined as a ratio of require
 revenue to annual dispatched electricity.
 Two-part tariffs are set for plants whose participation in the electricity and capacity balance of the
 system is instructed by the system operator. Two-part tariffs are composed of charges for electricity to
 cover variable costs of power generation and capacity charge for ordered capacity to cover fixed costs of
 the plant.

E.       Key Steps for Improving Financial Standing of the Power Sector

The current financial situation of the power sector is not sustainable and will increasingly
jeopardize power supply reliability and quality in the future. A complex of measures need to be
undertaken immediately to address the situation, including:

1.       Prohibiting expenses, borrowing, and lending that are not related to the core business of
state-owned power companies. The Government, as the owner of the state-owned companies,
should legally prohibit the state-owned companies: (a) borrowing for non-core business related
activities; (b) lending to each other or other companies; and (c) incurring expenses not related to
their core business.

                                                           8
2.      Improving the financial standing of ENA. As a single buyer of the power sector, the
financial health of ENA is essential for the financial viability of the overall power sector and for any
future private and public investments that the Government attracts to the sector. To that end, ENA
should be compensated for the losses is incurred in the past two years due to unfavorable
generation mix, the tariff setting methodology should be revised to prevent the current situation
from repeating in the future.

   A. Allow for recovery of AMD24 billion in accumulated losses of ENA. The PSRC should allow for
   recovery of accumulated losses of ENA (including interest costs) to avoid insolvency of the
   company. The recovery of the losses could be done through a combination of: (a) gradual end-
   user tariff increase and (b) refinancing of expensive ENA debts with longer term and less
   expensive debts. ENA should consider developing a financial recovery plan in discussions with
   the Government and PSRC in order to discuss raising of longer maturity and lower interest rate
   financing with potential financiers, such as the private arms of IFIs. The Bank team estimates
   that recovery of accumulated ENA losses will require 14% (AMD62/kWh) increase of end-user
   tariff. If such increase is implemented through one-time adjustment of the end-user tariff, then
   this may have tangible impact on poverty.

   B. Change the methodology for adjustment of ENA’s tariff margin to fully reflect in the new
   tariff period the loss (profit) incurred due to mismatch between actual and forecast margin
   during the preceding tariff period.

3.      Revision of tariff-setting methodology to allow adjusting the tariff by the full size of
natural gas purchase related loss (profit) incurred due to fluctuation of AMD/US$ exchange rate .
The PSRC will revise the existing tariff-setting methodology to allow YTPC and Hrazdan TPP tariffs
for each new tariff period to fully reflect the loss (profit) accrued due to difference between
forecast and actual cost of natural gas purchased during preceding tariff period, which may be
fluctuating due to difference between forecast and actual US$/AMD exchange rate.

4. Refinancing the commercial loans of state-owned companies and redeeming the
commercial payables.

   A. Refinance commercial debts. The Government, as the owner, could seek refinancing of the
   outstanding AMD6.5 billion in short-term commercial loans for Yerevan TPP and ANPP, which
   cost the sector AMD0.7 billion in interest expenses per year. Specifically, the Government could
   consider refinancing those debts with longer term and lower interest rate IFI funding. This
   approach for servicing of debts will cost the sector around AMD0.4 billion during the grace
   period (14.5 years) and AMD1.4 billion per year thereafter (including repayment of the
   principal) with declining schedule. Yerevan TPP and ANPP would substantially reduce debt
   service costs, thus, increasing funds available for better maintenance of assets. The refinanced
   debts should be serviced either through the state budget or by inclusion of the debt service in
   the tariff.

5. Settling the non-commercial debts of the state-owned companies through a series of write-
offs. On June 10, 2015, The Government adopted a decree (No. 617-N) to settle the debts of ANPP,
Yerevan TPP and HVEN to Vorotan HPP.

6. Liquidation of Haigasard: Liquidation of Haigasard SPV is essential for avoiding non-
transparent transactions within the energy sector in future and using this entity for channeling the
power sector funds for non-core business related reasons.

7. Starting a legal process to recover the debts from Nairit and Vanadzor chemical plant. The
Government should authorize the relevant state-owned power companies to file debt collection
lawsuits given the sizeable amount of outstanding debt and persistent non-payment by the debtor.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1. Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe and has a population of 43 million, the majority of
whom live in urban areas. It is a lower middle income country, with the services, industry and agriculture
sectors being main contributors to the country’s GDP. Ukraine faces a number of environmental
challenges, as identified in its National Environmental Strategy 2020 (NES). Key among these are: air
pollution; quality of water resources and land degradation; solid waste management; biodiversity loss;
human health issues associated with environmental risk factors; in addition to climate change.

2. To address its environmental challenges, Ukraine has made important steps in building its
environmental institutions and management, since gaining independence in 1991: the country developed a
comprehensive regulatory framework for environmental protection; became signatory to major
international conventions; established the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) and a
number of agencies with environmental protection responsibilities; developed environmental management
instruments; and established environment and nature protection funds.

3. The system of environmental protection inevitably depends on the overall system of public
governance in the country. Ukraine’s environmental management has been undergoing changes over the
past 3-5 years with a decentralization reform that started in 2010-2012. Ukraine embarked on
decentralization reform, which aims to delegate significant governance authority and financial resources
from central level to local government. The concept of the reform was approved in April 2014. It
includes, inter alia, achieving optimal distribution of powers between the local authorities and central
authorities; implementing fiscal decentralization, including through redistribution of taxes; improving the
quality of management at the regional level; strengthening inter-sectoral coordination in the formation
and implementation of state regional policy; and harmonizing national and regional long-term strategic
priorities. Ukraine also took a course towards European Union integration and started to adopt legislative
acts in line with EU directives and norms. In 2014, the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the
EU was ratified. This agreement now defines the principles of cooperation in different spheres, including
environmental protection and natural resources management.

4. Objective. The objective of the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) is to assess the adequacy and
performance of the policy, legal, and institutional framework for environmental management in Ukraine,
in light of the decentralization process of environmental governance and wider reform objectives, and to
provide recommendations to government to address the key gaps identified.

5. The preparation of the CEA relied on information published and posted on Web sites by government
and regional authorities; on the review of available analytical reports on environmental management in
Ukraine; and on interviews and focus group meetings with stakeholders in Kyiv, as well as in three pilot
regions: Ivano-Frankivsk, Poltava, and Vinnytsya. The scope of this report did not include economic
analysis of Ukraine’s environmental priorities and its environmental management system. Such analysis
is recommended to link environmental management with growth and development objectives.

6. Key Findings. The institutional analysis has identified several key challenges that need to be
addressed to foster the environmental management system’s role in setting a sustainable development
path and enhancing Ukraine’s competitiveness for attracting public and private investments:

Enhance the legislative framework for environmental management.

7. The scope of Ukrainian environmental legislation is quite broad and comprehensive (more than 300
legal acts). However, environmental legislation is largely declaratory in nature and does not have all the

                                                                                                        xii
essential enforcement mechanisms, many of the acts are not coordinated with each other, and legislation
undergoes limited analysis of its impact and is frequently changed. The signature of the EU-Ukraine
Association Agreement is expected to spur the enhancing environmental legislation by bringing in line
with the EU directives.

Strengthen mechanisms for setting environmental priorities linked with Ukraine’s growth and
development objectives and reflect these priorities in environmental and sectoral policies and strategies.

8. The Government of Ukraine approved the National Environment Strategy – 2020, as well as other
strategic government both cross sectoral and sector specific. The following key gaps are identified in
Ukraine’s strategy documents in the area of environment: lack of clear prioritization among the different
environmental goals (this lack undermines opportunities for implementation by failing to be responsive to
financial and human resources scarcity); lack of a clear baseline and realistic target indicators; lack of
clear time frames in the national plans of measures; and weak integration of environmental issues into
sectoral strategies, programs, and activities.

Build effectiveness of the environmental institutions by improving coordination and streamlining
mandates across the different agencies.

9. A number of agencies at the central level are responsible for environmental management. The
Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) is the main state authority tasked with the key role
of developing and ensuring the implementation of environmental policy at the central government level.
The ministry coordinates several agencies, including the State Ecological Inspectorate, State Agency of
Water Resources, State Service of Geology and Mineral Resources, and State Agency of Ukraine on
Exclusion Zone Management. MENR also supervises three research institutes and nine state enterprises.

10. The MENR’s structure and responsibility have been undergoing significant and co ntinuous change
over the past 25 years that included frequent reorganizations and restructuring. The last significant
organizational change was conducted in 2013, when the State Environmental Investment Agency
responsible for the implementation of the UN Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto Protocol was
abolished.

11. MENR collaborates with other Ministries: Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry; Ministry of
Agrarian Policy and Food; Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing, and Communal
Services; Ministry of Infrastructure, and other ministries, state agencies, and inspectorates. However, the
level of collaboration is low and consists mainly of providing "no objection" to legislative acts, programs,
and regulations issued by each government agency. This multitude of agencies with responsibilities in
environmental management, coupled with sometimes overlapping responsibilities, frequent organizational
change and weakness in coordination limit the effectiveness of environmental management.

Strengthen environmental management capacity at the regional level.

12. The environmental management system underwent significant changes due to the Law of 2012 on
“Introducing Changes to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine with the Aim of Optimization of Powers and
Authorities of the Executive Authorities in the Sphere of Ecology and Natural Resources, Including the
Local Level.? The law amended several laws and codes and transferred a number of functions (such as
permits for certain activities, monitoring, supervision, expert reviews, and so forth) from the central
government (MENR) to local governments (oblast state administrations). This law was followed by the
Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 159 (2013) by which MENR’s oblast branches were abolished
and respective departments in oblast state administrations (OSA) were created. This process led to lack of
continuity between MENR’s oblast branches and OSAs’ environmental departments. Consequently, these

                                                                                                        xiii
environmental departments do not have legal information regarding past actions, such as decisions of
ecological expertise, records of past performance, and violations of environmental regulations.

13. At present, each oblast has several agencies with responsibilities for natural resources, permitting,
control, and enforcement – and there is no procedure outlining the coordination mechanism among them.
Consequently, the system of environmental management at the sub-national level requires considerable
effort to develop and organize, because legislative acts are not consistent; regulatory acts are often
missing; and the functions of various agencies are not clearly defined, which results in gaps for some
functions on one hand, and overlap with the central level functions on the other hand.

Expand and strengthen the implementation of a portfolio of environmental policy instruments, with
emphasis on economic instruments and mechanisms to foster good environmental practice in line with
EU requirements.

14. Ukraine’s legislation provides for the use of a wide spectrum of direct and indirect environmental
policy instruments. However, implementation requires strengthening to ensure that they are in line with
international good practices:

15. Environmental Regulations and Standards are based mainly on the use of maximum allowable
concentrations. Only recently, Ukraine started introducing changes for implementation and adoption of
the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive and use of the principle of best available
techniques.

16. Environmental and Compliance Monitoring and enforcement: A number of government agencies
have responsibilities for environmental monitoring, but the efficiency of their work is undermined by
outdated equipment, lack of qualified personnel, and insufficient funding. There is need to clearly divide
responsibilities between the state bodies at the national and regional levels. The OSA environmental
departments lost some of the functions that regional MENR departments had. Cooperation between
departments of OSA and oblast branches of State Ecological Inspectorate is weak. Moreover, in August
2014, the CMU imposed a moratorium (with certain exceptions) on inspections of the enterprises and
organizations by the State Ecological Inspectorate.

17. Environmental Licensing: The environmental licensing system is broad, and it is characterized by a
large number of permits. By the Law of 2012 (mentioned above), responsibilities for environmental
permits were divided between the central government and OSA environment departments. Most functions
stayed with the central agency, which also reserves the right to revoke any permit approved by regional
authorities.

18. Environmental Impact Assessment: The EIA process is highly technical, and consultation and
disclosure are limited. In addition to MENR, the Ministry of Regional Development and Construction
plays an important role in regulating requirements to EIA, as well as in reviewing EIA documentation.
The MENR prepared a draft EIA law in response to the adaptation of Ukraine’s legislation to EU norms,
although this EIA law has not yet been adopted.

19. Strategic Environmental Assessment: At present, no dedicated law or regulations govern SEA. A
draft SEA law was prepared in line with the EU directives, but it remains in draft form.

20. Market-Based Instruments / Economic Instruments: Market-based mechanisms/instruments are
not well developed in Ukraine. Environmental economic instruments that are in use in Ukraine include
emission charges, taxes for special use of natural resources, sanctions on environmental pollution, and
excises and customs duties on environmentally harmful products. However, in many cases, emission

                                                                                                      xiv
charges and sanctions are low and do not stimulate the introduction of environmentally sound
technologies.

Build demand for strengthened environmental management and governance through public access to
information and public participation.

21. Ukraine is party to the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation, and Access
to Justice on Environmental Protection. The MENR publishes some information and the results of its
work on its Web site, and so do environmental departments of OSA and other agencies. Agencies also
share information they have upon request, but often they do not have the requested information. Public
participation is effected through the MENR Public Council (Hromadska Rada), which fulfills the
functions of consultation and of an advising body for the development of environmental policy. Similar
councils exist as advisory bodies at OSAs. There is significant scope for enhancing public access to
information and public participation by activating the public consultation and participation mechanisms of
the different policy instruments and strengthening the environmental monitoring and data availability.

22. NES–2020 foresaw the development and implementation by 2015 of incentives for enterprises to
introduce clean technology production, various energy-efficient and environmental measures, corporate
social responsibility, and environmental audit and certification to stimulate Private Sector Engagement in
Environmental Management. However, assessment of the NES’s implementation demonstrated that this
objective of the strategy was not achieved.

23. Synergies for Strengthening Ukraine’s Environmental Institutions. The ongoing decentralization
reform and the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement create an opportunity and an impetus for the much-
needed reform of the environmental management system in Ukraine. Strengthened environmental
institutions would help Ukraine to more efficiency and cost-effectively address the country’s
environmental priorities; would contribute towards ensuring that Ukraine’s economic growth and
development objectives are met in an environmentally sustainable manner; and facilitate Ukraine’s ability
to be in line with international financing institutions’ requirements for environmental and social
safeguards, thus improving the country's attractiveness for investments. Strengthened environmental
management system will also contribute towards facilitating the implementation of the signed EU-
Ukraine Association Agreement.

24. Key Policy Recommendations. To start, it may be essential to prepare and implement a Roadmap
for Reform of Environmental Management in Ukraine in the short to medium term (1–2 years). To
achieve this, the following tasks should be completed:

        Task 1: Carry out a functional review of the institutions involved in environmental management
        from the point of view of implementation of the EU Environmental Directives. In other words,
        the review should answer the question of whether the environmental institutions in Ukraine as
        they are can effectively implement the EU Directives. A public environmental expenditure review
        should accompany the functional review, to identify government resource allocations to different
        environment goals at central and regional levels.

        Task 2. Determine Ukraine’s environmental priorities linked to its growth and development
        agenda. An important input into setting priorities is the cost of environmental degradation study
        (COED), which would estimate in monetary terms the impacts of major environmental problems
        in Ukraine. The COED may be combined with statistical tools such as distributional surveys to
        determine the priorities that are linked to poverty.



                                                                                                       xv
        Task 3. Apply EU requirements to environmental management, delineate responsibilities, and
        subordination and coordination in the sphere of environmental management of central
        government units (including MENR, ministries, agencies, and so forth); regional government;
        regional branches of central government units; and local government (city, settlement, and
        village).

        Task 4. Develop a roadmap for necessary legislative and regulatory changes (prioritization,
        sequencing, and depth of necessary revisions/change), based on Ukraine’s identified priorities
        and taking into account Ukraine's commitments under the EU–Ukraine Agreement.

25. The need for this roadmap is dictated by the necessity of reforming the existing Ukrainian post-Soviet
institutional structure of environmental management in such a way that it can efficiently function in a
significantly changed administrative, budget, and legal environment.

26. A number of central government agencies, regional authorities, and municipalities will have to be
involved in preparing and implementing the roadmap. This can be achieved by establishing a task force
representing key relevant authorities under Ukraine’s Prime Minister or Vice -Prime Minister. Such a task
force might, for example, be called “The Task Force for Preparation and Implementation of the Roadmap
for Reform of Environmental Management.?

27. The following table summarizes other recommendations, which should be followed after key tasks
of the Roadmap for Reform have been completed.

      INTRODUCTION
1.1   Overview

1. Ukraine is a sovereign, independent, democratic, social, and jural state. It is the second largest
country in Europe, with a total area of 603,550 km2 and a population of approximately 43 million (as of
January 1, 2015), 69% of whom live in urban areas.

2. Ukraine is a lower middle-income country with a GDP of $131.8 billion (2014). Agriculture
contributes 12.1% of GDP, industry 29%, and services 58.8%. Ukraine’s key agricultural products
include grains, sugar beets, sunflower seeds, vegetables, beef, and milk. Key industries in Ukraine are
coal, electric power, ferrous and nonferrous metals, machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, and
food processing.

3. According to the Human Development Index (2013), Ukraine ranked 78th out of 186 countries,
which places it in the high human development category. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development
Index—which takes into consideration how the achievements of a country in health, education, and
income are distributed among its population by “discounting? each dimension’s average value according
to its level of inequality (HDI Web site 2015)—shows a loss of 9% points due to inequality. While
absolute poverty has decreased over the past decade to approximately 1%, approximately 24.1% (2010
estimates) of Ukraine’s population live below the poverty line. Moreover, poverty levels in rural areas are
almost twice as high as they are in urban areas.

4. Ukraine faces governance challenges as it lags behind Europe and Central Asia countries in all
indicators of the Worldwide Governance Indicators—particularly on Political Stability, Rule of Law, and
Control of Corruption Indicators. The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2014 by Transparency
International ranks Ukraine 142 out of 175 countries, with a score of 26 of 100.

5. In February 2014, following protests that ousted the previous president, a national unity interim
government was appointed that embarked on an ambitious reform agenda. The new government set a
course towards integration with the European Union, and Ukraine signed the Ukraine – EU Association
Agreement in 2014. The Agreement calls for the approximation of Ukraine’s standards and legisl ation to
the EU directives in particular areas (including environmental legislation).

6. Ukraine’s ambitious reform agenda provides an opportunity to enhance Ukraine’s environmental
management capacity to improve the well-being of Ukrainians, but also to ensure that the environment is
integrated into the broader sustainable development plans and ongoing reforms. The Government of
Ukraine has requested the World Bank Group’s support in implementing its ambitious reform agenda, and
the WBG announced that in addition to its ongoing portfolio of US$3.7 billion, it stands ready to provide
US$3 billion of new financing to Ukraine and to assist the country in formulating and implementing
urgently needed reforms (World Bank 2014).

7. Since gaining independence in 1991, Ukraine made significant progress in its environmental
management. The country developed a wide regulatory and legal base for environmental legislation;
became signatory to major international and regional environmental agreements; established the Ministry
of Ecology and Natural Resources tasked with setting the country’s environment policy; and established
the Environment Protection Fund and the Nature Protection Fund, among others. In addition, over the
years of independence, a vibrant civil society and active non-governmental organizations working on


                                                                                                         1
environmental issues have emerged. Despite these achievements, Ukraine’s environmental institutions
face key challenges, some of which stem from the broader governance challenges.

8. A number of analyses was carried out on Ukraine’s environmental management over the past decade.
However, there is no recent assessment of Ukraine’s environmental institutions after the decentralization
of environmental management that started in 2010–2012, and that resulted in abolishing the Ministry of
Ecology and Natural Resources regional departments and transfer of responsibilities to local government
authorities.

9. The Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) is an upstream analytic tool that aims to integrate
environmental considerations into the development process and sustainable development assistance,
including Development Policy Lending operations (DPLs). Institutional analysis is a key building block
of Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) and is the key focus of this CEA. Strengthened environmental
institutions are essential for ensuring the implementation of the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement and
compliance with its terms and requirements. Strengthened environmental institutions would also facilitate
Ukraine’s ability to be in line with international financing institutions’ requirements for environmental
and social safeguards and risks—many of which call for a strong system.


1.2     Objective

10. The objective of the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) is to assess the adequacy and
performance of the policy, legal, and institutional framework for environmental management in Ukraine,
in light of the decentralization process of environmental governance and wider reform objectives, and to
provide recommendations to government to address the key gaps identified.

1.3     Approach and Limitations

11. The following factors influenced the preparation of the CEA and to an extent determined its focus:

     The environmental decentralization reform that started in 2010–2012 and which resulted in the
      abolishment of the regional department of the MENR – as a result of this reform, there was lack of
      information and assessment on how the reform was implemented, what were the results, and what is
      the environmental management set up on the ground.

     Bottom up pressure for overall systemic reforms: The Revolution of Dignity clearly signaled the
      bottom up need for critical systemic reforms in Ukraine – many of which touch on the environmental
      institutions. The new Government has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda, and this report,
      while not directly addressing this wider reform, is written within its context and general ambition.

     Signature of the Ukraine – EU Association Agreement: the formal signing and the ratification
      process of the Ukraine – EU Association Agreement provides formal focus for the harmonization of
      the Ukrainian legislation with the EU environmental directives.

     Conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine limits the focus of report: This report is being prepared at a
      time of continuing conflict in the eastern part of the country and following the Autonomous Republic
      of Crimea and City of Sevastopol March 2014 referenda to join the Russian Federation, which were
      widely criticized and declared as “having no validity? in the UN General Assembly resolution 68/262.
      This has directly affected the environmental institutions and function of environmental agencies in the
      affected areas (World Bank 2014). As such, this report did not assess the environmental management
      in the regions that are affected directly by the conflict or those immediately adjacent to them since

                                                                                                           2
    priorities in these areas are shifted to internally displaced persons and defensive activities (for
    example, Donetsk, Luhansk, Odessa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zaporizhzhya).

12. The preparation of the CEA followed the following approach:

       Review of available analytical work. A number of key analytical works have already been carried
        out focusing on environmental management in Ukraine, including but not limited to the public
        environmental expenditure review (World Bank 2003); the two environmental performance
        reviews (UNECE 1999, 2007); Performance Review of the State Environmental Protection Fund
        of Ukraine (OECD 2006); and annual reports and assessments prepared by government
        authorities and civil society.

       Review of the policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional framework of environmental
        management at the national level in Ukraine.

       Review of the institutional framework for environmental management at the regional and local
        levels – to highlight the key changes that took place since the decentralization of environmental
        management took place in 2012 and onwards. The review focused on three regions (oblasts) in
        Ukraine: Poltava, Vinnytsya, and Ivano-Frankivsk. The three oblasts differ in their location,
        geography, and key industries, and they provide a glimpse of some of the common environmental
        management challenges faced at the sub-national level.

       Interviews and meetings with stakeholders and focus groups in Kyiv and in the three pilot
        regions.

13. The current review does not provide a systematic analysis of the state of environment in Ukraine.
Moreover, while strengthened environmental management is expected to provide positive economic
return in terms of reduced cost of environmental degradation, increased cost effectiveness of
environmental regulations, and improved competitiveness, the current report did not include economic
analysis to quantify the current costs of environmental degradation and estimate the costs and benefits of
policy options and mitigation measures. It is recommended that such analysis be carried out to link
environmental management with poverty reduction and growth and development objectives, focusing on
the consequences of environmental degradation on the poorest and most vulnerable groups of the
population, as well as on the opportunities for green inclusive growth.




                                                                                                        3

     UKRAINE’S KEY ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES

14. Ukraine is characterized by a temperate continental climate, with precipitation that is
disproportionately distributed and decreasing in the country’s south and east. Its terrain is mostly rolling
upland plain, and the mountains cover approximately 5% of the country’s area. Three main ecological
zones may be recognized: mixed forests (Polissia), forest steppe, and steppe in the south (40 percent) in
addition to the highlands. The country has vast natural resources, including rich agricultural soil, timber,
metals and minerals, and rich biodiversity resources.

15. Ukraine faces a number of environmental and sustainability challenges. Ukraine’s adjusted net
savings shows a decline following a peak in 2004. In 2013, Ukraine’s adjusted net savings reached -5.4%
of gross national income (GNI), with mineral and energy depletions accounting for some of the depletion
as well as lower gross savings in comparison to comparator countries. (See figure 1.)

Figure 1. Adjusted Net Savings in Ukraine between 2000 and 2014




16. Environmental Performance Index: The Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy and the
Center for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University developed the
Environmental Performance Index (EPI). This index ranks how well countries perform on high-priority
environmental issues, and in 2014 Ukraine was ranked on 95th among 178 countries, that is improvement
of overall score by 5.44% over the past decade. The strongest achievements were made in air quality



                                                                                                          5
issues (by 21.33% in ten years change) and conducting policy in this area (Yale Center for Environmental
Law and Policy 2015).

17. Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Ukraine is on track towards achievement of the
millennium development targets for goal 7: ensure environmental sustainability (see table 2), even though
it still faces challenges in terms of differences between urban and rural populations.

18. Ukraine’s National Environmental Strategy – 2020 identifies the following key environmental
challenges: air pollution; quality of water resources and land degradation; solid waste management;
biodiversity loss and human health problems. Additionally, during the last decades, a number and
frequency of extreme climatic events have increased and affected the key economic sectors,
infrastructure, settlements, water resources, and natural ecosystems (State Statistics Service of Ukraine
2014).

Air Quality

19. The National Environmental Strategy 2020 identifies nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon oxide (CO),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter as key air pollutants. Stationary sources account for
approximately 60% of the emissions (vast majority of emissions are produced from extractive and
processing industries, and from electricity generation) while transport sector accounts for 40% of total
pollution load (NES 2020). For example, in 2013, 42% of the estimated air pollution load occurred in
Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. In 2002, ambient air pollution exceeded national air quality
standards in the most populated and industrialized Ukrainian cities. Even though Ukraine’s ambient air
quality standards are even stricter than the standards recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines
for Europe, almost all large Ukrainian cities exceed the WHO standards for specific pollutants. Strukova
et al. (2006) estimated the health losses from urban air pollution (PM2.5) in Ukraine at 27,000 excess
deaths and 280,000 DALYs lost annually, which was estimated at around 13 billion UAH (US $2.6
billion), or 4 percent of GDP in 2006.

20. According to the Central Geophysical Observatory review (2015), out of 47 cities in Ukraine where
regular monitoring was carried out in 2014, 22 cities were characterized by very high and high combined
air pollution levels. These cities included those with large industrial facilities (metallurgy, chemicals and
petrochemicals, and fuel and energy complexes), as well as those with significant transportation hubs.
Key pollutants included formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, phenol, hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide,
and suspended solids. (See table 3.)

21. Air emission charges account for approximately 70% of total environmental taxes, most of them from
stationary sources. At the same time, air quality and climate represents only 10% of current
environmental expenditures during 2010–2013.

Water Resources and Wastewater Treatment

22. Ukraine’s total renewable water resources are estimated at 139.6 million cubic kilometers per year,
and 3,106 cubic meters per capita per year. While this level puts Ukraine in the no stress level (defined as
below 1,700 cubic meters per capita per year), there is disparity in distribution of the water resources
between different regions. Table 4 below provides an overview of the abstraction, use, and treatment of
surface and ground water resources.

23. The NES 2020 notes that practically all surface and ground water resources are polluted. Key
pollutants include nitrogen and phosphorus, organic substances, which are exposed to light oxidation,
pesticides, oil products, heavy metals, and phenols (NES 2020) (Government of Ukraine 2010).

24. The main causes of surface water pollution is the discharge of contaminated municipal and industrial
waste water directly into the water body or through the sewage system; polluted runoff water from built-
up areas and farmland; and soil erosion in water recharge areas. Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Luhansk, and
Odesa oblasts account for approximately 75% of all discharges into surface waters. Key sectors
contributing to discharge of polluted waters are industrial enterprises (894 million cubic meters), followed
by housing and the communal sector (538 million cubic meters), and the agricultural sector (71 million
cubic meters). Due to the low quality of wastewater treatment, wastewater flow of contaminated surface
reservoirs is not reduced.

25. Almost 70% of the drinking water supply relies on surface water sources, which increases the
importance of reducing pollution of these water sources, including through adequate treatment of
wastewater and limiting the discharge of polluted water into surface and ground water bodies.

26. Wastewater treatment accounts for 43% of Ukraine’s current environmental expenditures during
2010-2013, which puts it at highest category of expenditure. This is in addition to the 6% expenditure for
the protection and rehabilitation of soil, and of ground and surface waters. However, it should be noted
that a large proportion (65% nationally) covers operational costs, which may indicate under-investment in
key wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure.

Solid and Hazardous Waste Management

27. Ukraine identifies four classes of industrial waste, grouped according to hazardous properties and
physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. The first, second, and third classes —considered most
harmful—represent 3% of the annual generation of waste, or 1% of waste accumulation. The fourth class
is considered less harmful and, in practice, represents the total accumulation of solid waste in Ukraine.
Major sources of waste generation in Ukraine are mining, chemical and metallurgical, machine building,
energy, wood pulp and paper, and agriculture sectors. Large accumulations of toxic wastes increase the
risks of ecological accidents from disposed heavy metals, oil products, pesticides, and other materials
(NES 2020). About 350 thousand tons of medical waste is being generated annually (NES 2020). Table 5
shows solid waste generation by classification from 2011 to 2013.

28. An IFC (2012) study on Waste Management in Ukraine (IFC 2012) highlighted Ukraine’s current
waste management practices as resource-inefficient and resulting in negative environmental impacts.
Municipal solid waste generation in Ukraine is estimated between 220–350 kg per capita annually. While
this is lower than EU’s general rate of 510 kilograms, it has been increasing from previous years.
Municipal solid waste is disposed of mainly in 4,157 open dumps and landfills, while 3.5% of total
municipal solid waste is incinerated. Ukraine recovers approximately 5% –7% of municipal solid waste


                                                                                                           8
(even though this may not take into consideration recovery at source - people taking everything of some
value from waste containers for resale for recycling), compared to 60% in EU member states—a figure
that requires Ukraine to double its solid waste disposal capacity in the next 15 years. The IFC (2012)
report identified key measures that are necessary to overcome the current administrative and financial
challenges facing the municipal solid waste sector. These include putting in place the following
mechanisms: market coordination, tariff setting, waste recovery incentives, and mechanisms for private-
sector engagement and financing. (See figure 2.)

29. Waste management accounted for 34% of Ukraine’s environmental expenditures during 2010–2013.
This is the second highest category after wastewater treatment.

Biodiversity and Forests

30. Due to its central location and climate, Ukraine is home to over 70 thousands of flora and fauna
species. It is also on crossroads for over 100 species of migratory birds. Almost 5.4% of the country’s

                                                                                                                       9
area (approximately 3 million hectares) is protected. The main threats to the country’s biodiversity
include loss of habitat due to agricultural activity, deforestation, urban expansion, and industrial activity,
as well as the introduction of invasive species (NES 2020).

31. Over 15% of Ukraine’s land area is covered by forests mainly in the northern and western parts of the
country (NES 2020). Ukraine’s timber stock was estimated at 1,736 million m3. Reforestation in Ukraine
is poor and it is principally determined by estimated wood cut area. Intensification of forestation is
generally not possible due to lack of funds. Forest contamination is increasing rapidly, and protection
from pests and tree diseases that represent a critical problem to forest areas is minimal.

32. Ukraine’s 5th National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity (MENR 2015c) identifies the
key threats to biodiversity. These are the uncontrolled use of forest resources, land degradation, and over-
exploitation of the steppes, recreational activities, and wastewater pollution of the aquatic and coastal
ecosystems, regulation of the Dnipro River and its tributaries changing the natural mode of floods,
organic pollution, and destruction of natural habitats. Additional key threats are natural factors such as
excessive overgrowing of small rivers by air-water vegetation that reduces the biodiversity of aquatic
organisms (plants and animals), invasive species, and climate change in forest areas.

33. In spite of its significance, biodiversity and habitat conservation accounted for almost 3% of
Ukraine’s environmental expenditures during 2010–2013.

Land Resources

34. According to the National Environmental Strategy 2020, the status of land resources in Ukraine is
close to critical. Key threats include: erosion, pollution and flooding, and many problems stem from the
lack of inventory and automation of system for maintenance of land cadaster, imperfection of land
management documentation and insufficiency of legal and regulatory support, that are coupled with low
institutional capacity of the respective executive authorities.

Climate Change

35. Ukraine is party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, which
provides provisions and quantitative commitments for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy
efficiency and the implementation of measures aimed at reducing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
gases. The key sectors for emissions of greenhouse gases in Ukraine, per 2013 figures, are energy (78%);
industrial processes and product use (21%); agriculture (9% in 2013); land use, land-use change and
forestry (16% net absorption of carbon dioxide) (this sector includes both emissions and absorption of
carbon dioxide); and waste (4%) (Government Agency for Ecological Investments of Ukraine 2015).

36. Ukraine’s 6th National Communication Report to the UNFCCC (MOE 2014) summarizes the
following key sectors of vulnerability to climate change impacts:
- Agricultural sector – Grain yield may decrease by 10–16% due to increase in the frequency and
    severity of drought during the growing season, decrease in the frequency of precipitation and an
    increase in the intensity of rainfall, and lack of sustainable snow depth needed for crops to weather
    sub-freezing temperatures.
- Forests – Long-term climate change is very likely to show generally negative impact on forests, the
    impact of increasing climate variability on terrestrial ecosystems are expected to be negative and
    significant. Increasing the fire danger is very likely in the various regions of the country.
- Human health – The report expects that human health will be affected through changes in vector
    ecology, as well as impacts of extremes of temperature (cold season and heat waves).


                                                                                                           10
37. Ukraine’s NDS refers to Ukraine’s international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to the UN
Climate Change Framework Convention, and as part of the second target (Target 2. Improvement of
ecological situation and increase of level of ecological safety), calls for optimization of mix of sources of
energy. It also put as a target to elaborate a national policy and action plan for adaptation to climate
change. In preparation for the Paris COP 21, Ukraine prepared its Intended Nationally-Determined
Contribution to a New Global Climate Agreement (INDC). In its INDC, Ukraine is committed to not
exceed 60% of 1990 GHG emissions level in 2030. Ukraine also declared its support for national
adaptation processes in the context of the international commitments and has accorded identical priorities
to both the mitigation and adaptation activities. The INDC outlined the following next steps for
implementation:
- Adoption of relevant legislative acts for the INDC implementation.
- Implementation of the Association Agreement between the European Union, the European Atomic
    Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part, ratified
    by the Law of Ukraine dated 16.09.2014 № 1678 – VІІ.
- Development and implementation of measures aimed at increasing absorption of greenhouse gases.

      POLICY, LEGAL           AND     REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
FRAMEWORK
3.1   Broader Issues Affecting Environmental Management

38. The system of environmental protection inevitably depends on the overall system of public
governance existing (and the one that has existed) in the country. The present day environmental
governance system in Ukraine has inherited a certain legacy, and faces a number of challenges going
forward.

39. Ukraine embarked on decentralization reform, which aims to empower the local government.
The Government of Ukraine foresees decentralization in five steps (Government of Ukraine
Decentralization Website 2015):
    1. Define the territorial boundaries of the local government bodies and executive power. This step
       envisions the establishment a three-tiered system of administrative and territorial structure: 27
       regions, 120–150 districts (rayons), and 1,500–1,800 communities (hromady).
    2. Allocate responsibilities between the different levels of local government. The preservation of
       natural resources is expected to lie within the purview of the regional government. There is no
       information of what environmental responsibilities (if any) will be within the purview of the
       district (rayon) and community (hromada) levels of local governments.
    3. Allocate responsibilities between the local government and central authorities.
    4. Determine the required resources at each level.
    5. Ensure accountability of local government.

40. The Government of Ukraine has stepped up its decentralization reform following the approval
of the reform concept in April 2014. The proposals on changes to Constitution of Ukraine and draft
laws have been formulated and submitted to the parliament for review and approval. The laws on
territorial communities’ cooperation and state budget, with significant expansion of local budget’
revenues, in line with the reform requirements, were passed in 2014, as well as the State strategy for
regional development up to 2020. Box 1 summarizes the key goals of the State Strategy for Regional
Development up to 2020.
Box 1. Key Goals of the Government Strategy for Regional Development up to 2020

 The Regional Development Strategy – 2020, identified three key goals:
 1. Enhance regional competitiveness;
 2. Territorial socioeconomic integration and spatial development; and
 3. Effective governance of regional development, this includes:
     Decentralization reform of local government and administrative-territorial structure
         Introduction of a three-tier system of administrative-territorial structure
         Definition of a reasonable territorial basis for the work of local authorities and executive
            bodies that can ensure the availability and quality of services provided by such authorities
         Achieving optimal distribution of powers between the local authorities and executive
            authorities by transferring executive functions of executive bodies of local administrations
            to the respective level councils.
         Implementation of fiscal decentralization, including through redistribution of national taxes,
            ensuring autonomy of local budgets guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine, securing
            stable revenue base for each element of local government to allow the implementation of

                                                                                                     13
              their functions and providing fiscal incentives for communities
          Creation of appropriate material, financial and organizational conditions for strengthening
              the economic base of local communities
          Ensuring the availability and quality of public services
        Improving the strategic planning of regional development at national and regional levels
        Improving the quality of management of regional development
          Improving the efficiency of local administrations, improving relations between local
              administration and natural and legal persons through the introduction of e-governance
          Creating an effective system for training and professional development of central and local
              executive authorities, local governments in the governance of regional development
          Improving the monitoring of efficiency of budgetary funds, increased responsibility of local
              authorities for the effective use of resources, aimed at solving social and economic problems
              of regional development
          Enhancing the role of NGOs in shaping the priorities of regional development,
              implementation and monitoring of the implementation
        Strengthening inter-sectoral coordination in the formation and implementation of state regional
         policy
          Reconciliation of objectives, priorities, tasks and activities of central and local executive
              authorities and local government in solving current problems of regional development and
              achieving long-term strategic goals
          Developing an electronic system for sharing of information between the central and local
              authorities
          Harmonization of national and regional long term strategic priorities
          Harmonization of national and regional interests in the development and implementation of
              state regional policy through: a clear division of responsibilities of central and local
              executive authorities, local government; transparent and sustainable distribution of tax
              resources between the state and local budgets; taking into account the local government of
              national interests in solving local issues; impact assessment policy, which is implemented by
              the central executive authority in the relevant area, the level of socioeconomic development
              of regions, separate territories
        Institutional support for regional development

41. During 2010–2013, administrative reforms that focused on decentralization of authority in
Ukraine seriously affected institutional capacity and functions of environmental management. The
MENR regional departments were abolished and their functions were transferred to the state oblast / city
administrations. This reform in environmental management lead to loss of environmental information and
databases, loss of experienced personnel and gaps in implementation of environmental policy and
legislation.

42. However, Ukraine still faces a number of internal challenges in terms of adequacy of policy and
legislation and the implementation of necessary environmental governance changes and reforms.
Delays in adoption of necessary legal acts and regulations in environmental sphere due to frequent
changes in the government and vested interested, have hindered the building of an appropriate
institutional framework with clear responsibilities and a wide stakeholder participation in the process of
making policy decisions (Melnychuk et al. 2015).



                                                                                                        14
43. Ukraine lags behind Europe and Central Asia countries in all of the Worldwide Governance
Indicators, and Ukraine lags behind lower middle-income countries in Political Stability, Rule of Law,
and Control of Corruption Indicators (see figure 3).

Analytical Issues. www.govindicators.org

44. Ukraine is perceived as one of the most corrupt countries, ranking 142 out of 175 countries in
the 2014 Transparency International index (Transparency International 2015). Corruption in
Ukraine could be observed in many aspects of public life, from procurement contracts to licenses and
permits for small and medium-sized enterprises (Government of Ukraine 2014). Literature demonstrates
that state authorities and civil society developed a number of anti-corruption activities, and recently the
Parliament of Ukraine approved the Anti-Corruption Strategy for 2014–2017. However, to date, many
measures are only on paper and have not been implemented. The Government of Ukraine (2014)
diagnostic study underlines that most laws are approved to advance of specific personal or business
agendas rather than the priority of public good. That is why laws are repeatedly amended and do not agree
with other legal acts. Ukraine uses a wide range of support from international donors in improving the
country’s policy and developing strategies and analyses in environmental sphere. However, internal
efforts are needed to solve issues, such as appropriate collaboration and distribution of functions between
the national and regional levels; integration of environmental issues at the sectoral policy level; and
building the relationship between the state authority and civil society and enhancing transparency and
broader public participation, and so on.


                                                                                                        15
45. Ukraine took a course towards European Union integration, and started to adopt legislative acts
in line with the EU directives and norms. Thus, in 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine approved a law “On
State Program for Adapting the Legislation of Ukraine to the Legislation of European Union?, and the
Plans of Measures regarding the fulfillment of this Program were adopted by the CMU’s resolutions for
2011, 2012 and 2013 years. The key step on the road to EU integration was made on September 16, 2014,
by ratification of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, which defined
the further principles of cooperation in different spheres, including environmental protection and natural
resources management. The Association Agreement, which will fully come into force after the ratification
by all EU member states, stipulates the timetable for the gradual approximation of Ukrainian legislation to
EU directives. By February 2015, this Agreement was ratified by 14 EU member states.

46. Another important step was made on November 21, 2014, by the signing of the Coalition Agreement
of Ukrainian Parliament’s Parties. This document includes a chapter “Environmental Management
Reform and Integration of Environmental Policy to Other Sectoral Policies.?

3.2    State Authority and Political Decision-Making Process

47. According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the country’s state authority is divided into legislative,
executive, and judicial branches. The President of Ukraine is the Head of the State, and is the chief
executive officer in the system of state authorities. Ukrainian citizens in a secret vote elect the President
for a five-year term. The President does not lead or take part in any of the three branches of state
authority, but embodies the country and state authority integrally.

48. Based on the Constitution of Ukraine (Article 106) and Decree of the President No. 970/2006 dated
April 15, 2008— “Regulation about the procedure of preparation and introduction of drafts of the
President’s decrees?—the President of Ukraine issues the decrees and directions within his jurisdiction,
and their implementation is compulsory throughout the country’s territory.

49. Parliament of Ukraine (Verkhovna Rada) is a single body of legislative authority. It consists of 450
deputies whom Ukrainian citizens in a secret vote elect for a four-year term.

50. The Verkhovna Rada has the following key powers and tasks: adopting laws; defining internal and
external policy; introducing changes to the Constitution of Ukraine; defining interrelations between
Parliament and the President of Ukraine; approving the state budget of Ukraine and introducing changes
to this budget; assigning Presidential elections and granting consent regarding the President’s selection of
the Prime Minister; arranging the country’s administrative-territorial system; and adopting national
strategies and programs in economic, scientific, technical, social, and environmental domains.

of the Chernobyl Disaster of the Verkhovna Rada is responsible for legislation on environmental issues.
The latest committee was established in December 2014, following the 2014 Parliamentary elections. The
committee consists of 15 deputies, and as of March 2015, the committee has reviewed 87 draft laws and is
the proponent for 35 draft legal acts that are in approval stage (Parliament of Ukraine 2015).

52. The executive authority consists of three levels:

      1. The Cabinet of Ministers coordinates the work of the ministries and other bodies of executive
         authority. It consists of a Prime Minister, three Vice Prime Ministers, and 16 Ministers (Cabinet
         of Ministers of Ukraine 2015). Government agencies provides implementation of financial,
         pricing, investment, and tax policy, as well as policy in the areas of employment of the

                                                                                                          16
           population, social protection, education, science and culture, environmental protection, ecological
           safety, and nature management. Government agencies formulate and implement state policy in
           relevant areas of competences according to the CMU’s strategy.

      2. Central level – ministries, state committees, central bodies of executive authority equated to the
         state committees, and central bodies of executive authority with special status.

      3. Local or territorial level, where their activity provide:
          Regional executive authority of general competence;
          Sectoral authorities, which are subordinated to the central bodies of executive authority or are
            subordinated both to central bodies of executive authority and to local bodies.

53. The ministry is a lead institution in the system of central bodies of executive authority, which
provides an implementation of state policy in its specific field. Ministers are at the head of ministries and
they are members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

54. Ministries and deputies of the CMU prepare draft legislation. Preparation and adoption of the
environmental protection legal acts, decrees and resolutions (postanovy and rozporyadzhennya), by the
CMU is conducted in the following way:

          The ministry prepares a draft legal act and sends it for agreement to sectoral ministries, other
           central bodies of executive authority and interested organizations.
          Within a timeframe of 30 calendar days, all stakeholders, should provide MENR their approval of
           the draft legal act or submit comments and suggestions for consideration.
          The MENR updates relevant draft legal act and sends it again for concurrence.
          The MENR submits a draft legal act or regulation for further proceeding to the Cabinet of
           Ministers of Ukraine after final agreement with all stakeholders has been reached.

55. Based on the adopted legal acts and regulations by the CMU, the ministry has a right to issue internal
orders in the relevant sphere of competence. Various norms, rules, standards, guidance, and
methodological recommendations—jointly referred to as regulations (normatyvno-pravovi akty)—are
approved by the CMU’s decrees/resolutions and orders of the ministries. To become legal, each
legislative document has to be registered with the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine.

3.3       Environment and Sector Strategies and Plans

56. The first document of environment and sector strategies and plans, which set the general background
for national policy and actions for environmental protection and their integration into economic reforms
in Ukraine, was “Main Directions of the National Policy of Ukraine for Environmental Protection,
Natural Resource Use and Environmental Safety? (“Main Directions?). This document was adopted by
the Parliament’s decree on March 5, 1998, for the implementation of Article 16 of the Constitution of
Ukraine and Law “On Environmental Protection? (1991). The Main Directions document established a
foundation for the development of a number of state targeted programs that were adopted during 1999–
2012. Following is a list of those programs:

     State Environmental Program on Crimea’s Development (“Environmentally Safe Crimea?) for 2011–
      2015 (2011);
     State Program on the Development of Mineral & Raw Materials in Ukraine till 2030 (2011);
     State Program “Forests of Ukraine? for 2010–2015 (2009);
     State Ecological Program on the Implementation of Environmental Monitoring (2007);


                                                                                                           17
   State Program on the Development of Mineral & Raw Materials in Ukraine till 2010 (2006);
   State Program “Drinking Water of Ukraine? for 2011–2020 (2005);
   Program on Cessation of Production and Usage of Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer for
    2004–2030 (2004);
   Program on Landslide Control’s Measures for 2005–2014 (2004);
   Solid Household Waste Management Program (2004);
   Program on the Implementation at the National Level the Decisions Adopted at the World Summit of
    Sustainable Development for 2003–2015 (2003);
   State Research and Engineering Program for Development of Topography and Geodesy and of the
    National Cartography for 2003–2010 (2003);
   National Program for the Protection and Rehabilitation of the Environment of the Black Sea and Sea
    of Azov (2001);
   National Toxic Waste Management Program (2000);
   State Program for the Creation of National Ecological Network in Ukraine for 2000–2015 (2000);
   Program on the Implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
    Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction for
    1999–2008 (1999).

57. To address its environmental challenges, Ukraine prepared its National Environment Strategy 2020
(NES) which was adopted by the Parliament in 2010. NES reflects the key environmental challenges
facing Ukraine, and assigns priorities to air quality, water and land resources, forests and biodiversity,
waste management and biosafety. The NES aims to achieve seven strategic goals, which include 104
strategic tasks:

        Goal 1. Promotion of public environmental awareness (16 strategic tasks);
        Goal 2. Improvement of ecological situation and promotion of environmental safety (34 tasks);
        Goal 3. Achievement of safe level of environmental conditions for the population health (11
                tasks);
        Goal 4. Environmental policy’s integration and improvement of integrated environmental
                management’ system (17 tasks);
        Goal 5. Cessation of losses of biological and landscape biodiversity, and creation of
                environmental network (8 strategic tasks);
        Goal 6. Provision of environmentally balanced nature management (9 tasks); and
        Goal 7. Improvement of regional environmental policy (9 tasks).

58. NES stipulates the following instruments for the implementation of environmental policy: inter-
sectoral partnership; strategic environmental assessment; strengthening licensing system; environmental
impact assessment; environmental audit, management, labelling, and insurance; standardization and
reporting; legislation; educational and scientific support; economic and financial mechanisms;
environmental monitoring and control; and international collaboration.

59. NES plans to achieve its goal in two stages:

        For the 2011–2015 period, the NES envisaged stabilizing Ukraine’s ecological situation, slowing
        down the increase of anthropogenic burden on the environment, creating appropriate conditions
        to increase the population’s level of ecological safety, starting to transition to the European
        Union’s environmental protection standards, drafting the respective laws and regulations, and
        improving public participation in environmental protection.




                                                                                                        18
        For the 2016–2020 period, the NES foresees gradually unbundling the functions of environmental
        protection and economic activity related to use of natural resources; implementing European
        Union ecological norms and standards, and ecological and systemic planning; introducing
        economic mechanisms to stimulate ecologically oriented structural transformations; achieving a
        balance between social and economic needs, and tasks in the area of environmental conservation;
        ensuring development of an ecologically efficient partnership of the state, business entities, and
        the public; and broadly disseminating ecological knowledge.

60. The NES underlines several objectives for air protection and foresees reduction of pollutants’
emissions into the air by stationary sources of 10% by 2015 and 25% by 2020. It also plans for the
establishment of standards of pollution load in the discharge gases for mobile sources according to the
standard Euro-4 by 2015, and Euro-5 by 2020. NES also addresses some aspects of climate change and
reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Thus, it aims to optimize the energy sector structure by increasing
the usage of energy sources with low level of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 10% in 2015 and 20%
by 2020. The Concept on Climate Change Adaptation and National Action Plan on Climate Change
Mitigation up to 2030 is also planned to be adopted by 2015.

61. NES foresees several provisions and objectives related to water resources:
 Reform of state management system in the area of rationalization of water use through the
    implementation of integrated water resources management;
 Reconstruction of existing and construction of new municipal wastewater treatment facilities with the
    goal to reach 15% reduction of water pollution (in the first place, organic matters, nitrogen and
    phosphorus compounds) by 2020, and reduce the discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater by
    20% by 2020;
 Development and realization of measures regarding a reduction of pollution level of landlocked
    waters and territorial sea in order to restore ecosystems of Black and Azov Seas.

62. In the area of waste management, the NES foresaw providing storage for 70% of municipal solid
waste by 2015 (for cities with populations greater than 250 thousand) at the specialized environmentally
safe landfills; to increase a volume of procurement and usage of waste in the capacity of secondary raw
materials by 1.5 times by 2020; introduce new technology for waste recycling; and create a system for
safe handling of medical waste by 2015.

63. In 2011, the Government of Ukraine adopted the National Environmental Action Plan 2011–2015
(NEAP) to implement the objectives of the NES. The NEAP describes 278 measures for implementation
during its five-year period. In 2015, a draft National Environmental Action Plan for 2016 –2020 was also
prepared.

64. A civil society review of the implementation progress of the NES showed that the most successful
implementation of strategic tasks was achieved in the framework of Goal 7 “Improvement of regional
environmental policy? (effectiveness >60%). Satisfactory results of the implementation of strategic tasks
were demonstrated in the framework of Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 4, and Goal 5 (effectiveness 30–60%), and
poor results were achieved in the framework of Goal 3 and Goal 6 (effectiveness <30%). In general, the
implementation effectiveness of the whole NES and NEAP was determined as satisfactory; however, it
should be noted that the range for satisfactory is quite wide—at between 30%–60%.

65. The NES foresees the integration of environment into sectoral policies, particularly in the areas of
energy and industry, transport, agriculture, and housing and utilities. Such integration requires close
collaboration with competent ministries and organizations and detailed review of the legislatives and
normative acts, which were prepared by different ministries and adopted by the GoU.


                                                                                                       19
66. Key sectoral strategies and programs include the following:

   Sustainable Development Strategy – 2020 (2015)
   National Action Plan on Renewable Energy – 2020 (2014)
   National Strategy for Regional Development – 2020 (2014)
   Concept of National Targeted Economic Program of the Industrial Development up to 2020 (2013)
   Energy Strategy – 2030 (2013)
   Agriculture Sector Development Strategy – 2020 (2013)
   National Program of Domestic Production (2011)
   Transport Strategy – 2020 (2010)
   National Action Plan on Settlements’ Improvement and their Adjacent Territories for 2010–2015
    (2009)
   State Targeted Program on the Development of the Ukrainian Village up to 2015 (2007)
   National Security Strategy (2007)
   Main Provisions of State Agrarian Policy – 2015 (2005)
   National Program for Reform and Development of Housing and Utility Services for 2009–2014
    (2004)
   Ukraine Economic and Social Development Strategy by a Way of European Integration for 2004–
    2015 (2004)

67. The Strategy of Sustainable Development “Ukraine – 2020? was approved in January 2015; it defines
the goal, vectors, roadmap, and indicators for defense, socioeconomic, institutional, policy, and
legislation relevant to State development. The strategy identifies four key vectors: development, security,
responsibility and pride and 62 reforms and development programs within these vectors. Reform of the
environment sector is identified under the security vector that aims to guarantee the security of the state,
the business and individuals, the protection of investments and private property, and calls for special
attention to be paid to the safety of human life and health, through ensuring a safe environment, among
others. A number of reforms that the strategy considers as top priority, will also have influence on the
environmental institutions in Ukraine, for example: decentralization and public governance reform,
upgrading the government and anti-corruption reform, and judicial reform.

68. Energy Strategy of Ukraine up to 2030 was first adopted in 2006, revised in 2013, and is currently
under review and update as the Energy Strategy up to 2035. However, there are still discussions between
experts and public regarding the relevance of the new Energy Strategy to other sectoral programs,
including NES. The draft Energy Strategy up to 2035 was published on the Web site of National Institute
for Strategic Studies of the President of Ukraine on January 15, 2015 for public consultation, and will be
adopted after the agreement between all stakeholders (NISS 2015).

69. The implementation of the National Strategy for Regional Development till 2020 (2014), may have
far reaching influence on environmental institutions as it calls for enhancing regional competitiveness;
territorial socioeconomic integration and spatial development; and effective governance of regional
development.

70. The National Program of Domestic Production (2011) for the first time took into consideration
environmental aspects of manufacturing. The Action Plan for its implementation calls for incentives for
industries that use and implement new technologies and renewable energy sources; foster the
implementation of energy management and audit and monitoring of measur es’ effectiveness. However,
this Action Plan did not provide clear financial allocation for the implementation of the measures.



                                                                                                         20
71. The Targeted Program for the Development of Agrarian Sector (2007) includes some environmental
aspects—for instance, the implementation of an effective system of soil fertility, soil monitoring,
environmentally friendly technologies, and production of organic products. However, most of these
measures were not implemented in practice. Moreover, the strategy does not address climate change
adaptation in the agricultural sector, nor does it address assessment of risks from extreme weather events.

72. The following key gaps are identified in Ukraine’s strategy documents in the area of environment:

   Lack of clear prioritization among the different goals for achieving the NES goals and its action
    plan. Taking into consideration the financial and human resources scarcity, it is essential that
    priorities are identified to ensure their implementation, moreover, there is lack of clarity on role of
    non-government actors in the achieving the NES goals.

   Lack of a clear baseline and realistic target indicators. For example, the NES refers to the baseline
    as a comparison for reduction of air emissions, discharges to water bodies and reduction of waste.
    However, the NES does not provide the baseline year, nor it provides a baseline. The indicators are
    mostly qualitative description and quantitative performance is not pointed out, which makes
    monitoring of implemented measures quite difficult. Most indicators in NES are quite ambitious, and
    would be difficult to achieve.

   Lack of clear time frames in the national plans of measures, within which the aims and indicators
    should be achieved (for instance, Plan of Measures for the Implementation of the Stockholm
    Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants);

   Lack of sufficient provisions regarding military operations in the NES 2020. The Legal document
    “Main Directions of the National Policy of Ukraine for Environmental Protection, Natural Resource
    Use and Environmental Safety,? adopted by the Parliament in 1998, had a chapter “Military Activity
    and Conversion of Military-Industrial Complex.? NES has some clauses regarding the military-
    defense field, but this topic is not addressed in sufficient detail, and there are no appropriate
    mechanisms and measures that could be applied, for instance, to the military activity in the eastern
    part of the country;

   The NES has two stages of implementation for national environmental policy. During the first stage
    of implementation (by the end of 2015), the Government of Ukraine emphasized providing the
    stabilization of ecological situation; decrease anthropogenic load on the environment and create
    conditions for increasing environmental safety’s level for all population. Only during the second stage
    of implementation (2016–2020), Ukraine is going to implement functions’ differentiation i n the
    sphere of environmental protection and economic activity for natural resources usage, and economic
    mechanisms and effective partnership between the state, business and community. This approach
    does not demonstrate effective environmental management and reforms, because it is difficult to
    stabilize the ecological situation and create environmental safety conditions, if there is no initially
    clear differentiation of functions, responsibilities, economic mechanisms and appropriate
    collaboration between all stakeholders;

   Weak integration of environment into sectoral strategies, programs, and activities. Such
    approach does not follow the principles of sustainable development and implementation of
    international agreements. For example, the adoption of the Strategy of Sustainable Development
    “Ukraine – 2020? was an important and long-expected step for Ukraine. The Strategy mentions
    environmental issues under the security vector, however, it does not go further to detail any



                                                                                                        21
      environmental aspects in the list of first-priority reforms and programs as well as in strategic
      indicators of implementation of the Strategy;

      Similarly, the National Strategy of Regional Development up to 2020 refers to sustainable
      development principles for the regions, but it focuses on socioeconomic development of Ukrainian
      regions without consideration for environmental protection and natural resources management.
      Strategic indicators do not cover environmental issues, only the unit weight of waste recovery to total
      volume of waste is included. It should be highlighted that while the Strategy was developed taking
      into account the latest changes and decentralization reforms, and one of the main tasks is the
      integration of various strategies and plans at national, regional and local levels as well as determining
      clear responsibilities between local authorities. However, in the list of priorities, the environmental
      aspects are not considered, although the latest changes resulted in liquidation of MENR’s regional
      departments and transfer of their functions to territorial-level authorities.

3.4     Environmental Legislation

73. Ukraine achieved important steps in developing its environmental legislation, became signatory to
environmental and sustainable development international conventions, and adopted a wide range of legal
acts and programs. The country’s progress in environmental policy is reflected in different evaluation
reports and analysis made by European Commission, UNDP, UNCTAD, and the International Center for
Policy Studies and public reports (Melnychuk et al. 2012; Ageeva et al. 2013; UNDP 2007a; UNDP
2007b; ICPS 2000; UNCTAD 2013; and Economic Commission for Europe 2007).

74. The scope of Ukrainian environmental legislation is quite broad and comprehensive (more than
300 legal acts) and covers most areas of environmental protection and natural resources
management. However, the environmental legislation faces a number of weaknesses:
     The environmental legislation is largely declaratory in nature and does not have all the essential
       enforcement mechanisms for the implementation of legal acts and international agreements;
     Many of the acts are not coordinated with each other; and
     Legislation undergoes limited analysis of its impact—for example, no in-depth analysis such as
       Regulatory Impact Analysis is conducted for proposed pieces of legislation.

75. The following factors are expected to further shape Ukraine’s environmental legislation: The ongoing
decentralization reform that at minimum will reshape the broader environmental management
responsibilities between national and territorial authorities; and the approximation of Ukraine’s legislation
to that of the EU in line with the Association Agreement signed in 2014 between Ukraine and the EU.
Following the ratification the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union in 2014,
a Coalition Agreement of Ukrainian Parliament’s Parties was signed, which includes a chapter on
Environmental Management Reform and Integration of Environmental Policy to Other Sectoral Policies
(Agreement on a Coalition of Parliamentary Factions “European Ukraine? 2014).

76. Below is a summary of the key legislation pertaining to air quality, water, and solid waste:

Air Quality

77. Ukraine is a party to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, which was ratified
in 1980. In response, Ukraine adopted several program documents, which define the national policy for
reduction of air emissions. These include the following:
 CMU Decree on “Program on Phased Cessation of Ethylated Gasoline’s Usage in Ukraine? (1999).
 Law “On Prohibition of Import and Sale of Ethylated Gasoline and Lead Additive to the Gasoline on
    the Territory of Ukraine? (2001).

                                                                                                            22
   “Concept on the Reduction of Heavy Metals’ Emissions into the Atmospheric Air? (2002), which
    stipulated the following main tasks:
    o Adoption of legal acts to reduce emissions of heavy metals;
    o Reduction of emissions of heavy metals by industrial companies;
    o Development of norms and standards regarding heavy metals according to international
        requirements; and
    o Conducting an inventory of emissions of heavy metals.
   CMU Decree “State Program for Upgrading the Equipment of the Hydrometeorological Survey
    System and the Ambient Environmental Pollution Survey System? (2001), which stipulates air
    pollution monitoring, including transboundary levels.
   CMU Decree “Concept of State Policy’s Implementation regarding Reduction of Pollutants’
    Emissions into the Atmospheric Air, which Caused Acidification, Eutrophication and Formation of
    Ground Ozone? (2003) – aims to introduce a state control system on air pollutants’ emissions,
    harmonize environmental legislation with EU directives, and introduce modern technological and
    gas-cleaning equipment.

78. Ukraine is also a party to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, ratified in
2007. For the implementation of this convention, the CMU approved a Plan of Measures for its
implementation in a resolution in 2012. This Plan foresees
 development of the register of stationary sources of pollutants’ emissions;
 organization of analyses conducted for specification of quantitative emission factors;
 organization of a monitoring system of emissions’ sources; and
 development of a legislative framework and establishment of a regulatory system, which will
    stipulate the implementation of best-available techniques at new and redesign facilities.

79. A review of this Plan may be warranted to clarify the timeframe for the achievement of aims and
indicators.

80. The Law “On Atmospheric Air Protection? in 1992 established the main requirements for air
protection in Ukraine. This law provides for the mandatory standardization and normalization for air
protection; compliance with the requirements during design, building and reconstruction of enterprises
and other facilities that may affect air quality; state reporting and air quality monitoring. Several legal acts
were adopted for the implementation of this law:

   The “Procedure for Organizing and Conducting Air Protection Monitoring? was adopted by the
    CMU of Ukraine in 1999.

   The “Procedure of State Record-Keeping in the Area of Atmospheric Air Protection? was approved
    by the CMU in 2001. This Procedure determines the uniform system for record-keeping of state
    facilities that may have negative impact on air quality and human health, record-keeping of types and
    amount of pollutants emissions as well as impact’s scale of physical and biological factors on the
    atmospheric air conditions.

   The “List of Most Widespread and Dangerous Substances, Emissions of which are Subject to
    Control? was adopted by the CMU in 2001. It relates mostly to nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and
    sulfur compounds, carbon oxide, lead, and its compounds.

   The “Manual on Providing Inventory of Heavy Metals’ Emissions into the Atmospheric Air? was
    issued by the MENR in 2001. This document established the requirements for the procedure for


                                                                                                             23
      inventorying heavy metals’ emissions from stationary sources in order to maintain records and
      minimize impacts on human health, natural resources and environment.

     The “Procedure on Conducting and Payment of Works, which Relate to the Issuance of Permits for
      Pollutants’ Emissions into the Atmospheric Air by Stationary Sources, and Keeping Records on a
      Number of Enterprises, Organizations, and Businessmen, which Received Such Permits? was adopted
      by the CMU of Ukraine in 2002, and this Procedure established a single mechanism for issuance of
      permits and payment execution;

     The same year, MENR approved the “Manual on Procedure and Criteria for a State Record of
      Facilities that have Negative Impact on Human Health and Atmospheric Air Conditions.? MENR
      took an important step in 2006, when standards for pollutants’ emissions limits from stationary
      sources were adopted.

81. In 2010, Ukraine ratified a Protocol about joining to the Agreement regarding Foundation of Energy
Community. According to the provisions of this treaty, the country should implement the Directive
2001/80/EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants
by January 1, 2018.

82. During 2011–2014, the European Commission funded the project “Air Quality Governance in ENPI
East Countries,? which provided support to Ukraine for compliance with international commitments
under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and its protocols. Additionally, study
tour, seminars, trainings, and workshops on inventorying emissions, COPERT 4 software (for calculating
emissions from road transport), data collection, and air pollution modelling were provided.1 Ukraine also
received the Recommendations for Development of a National BAT Guidance Framework for the
implementation of Directive 2010/75/EU on Industrial Emissions (integrated pollution prevention and
control).

Water Resources

83. Ukraine is Party to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and
Other Matter (ratified in 1976), Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution (ratified
in 1994), Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes
(ratified in 1999) and Danube River Protection Convention (2002).

84. For the fulfillment of these international treaties, the parliament of Ukraine adopted its key legislation
for the protection of water resources and water management—the Water Code—first adopted in 1995 and
update late in January 2015. The Water Code regulates water conservation; rational water use; protection
of water resources from pollution, contamination, and depletion; improvement of ecologic conditions of
water bodies; and protection of water user's rights.

85. The Water Code provides a background for the development of state targeted programs, regional
programs, water cadastre and various legal acts. It foresees conducting ecological expertize during
modernization and building the facilities related to water use; conducting a state recording of water
consumption and sewage discharge; conducting standardization in the area of water protection and usage;
and implementation of state monitoring of water resources.

86. The key legal acts and regulations pertaining to water resources management include the following:

     Law on “Approval of State-Targeted Program of Development of Water Industry and Ecological
      Sanitation of Dnipro River’s Basin up to 2021?;
     Parliament Resolution on “State Program ‘Drinking Water of Ukraine’ for 2011–2020?;
     CMU Decree “Procedure for Implementation of State Water Monitoring?;
     CMU Decree “Procedure for Approval and Obtaining Permits for Special Water Use?;
     CMU Decree “On Approval of the Rules of the Protection of Surface Waters from Pollution by the
      Return Waters?;
     CMU Decree “Procedure of Development and Approval of Pollution Discharge Limits and the List of
      Polluting Substances, for which the Discharge Limits are Set?; and
     Order of the Ministry of Environment and Nuclear Safety of Ukraine “Guidance on the Procedure for
      Developing and Setting the Discharge Limit Values for Polluting Substances Released into Surface
      Waters with Effluent Discharges?.

87.   The legal basis for marine protection, including the Black Sea, is foreseen in the following laws:
     Water Code;
     Land Code;
     Environmental Protection Law;
     Nature-Protected Areas Law;
     Law on Fauna;
     Law on Flora; and
     Law on Special (Sea) Economic Zone of Ukraine.

88. Methodologies of hydrographic and waterworks zoning of Ukraine were developed, which identified
the areas of main river basins. This development took place in the framework of the project “UNDP-GEF
Dnipro Basin Environment Program? and EU project “Complementary Support to the Ministry of
Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine for the Sector Budget Support Implementation.? This new
approach aims to improve water management system in Ukraine by introducing integrated river basin
management according to EU Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EU. The updated Water Code also
considered integrated river basin management.

Solid and Hazardous Waste

89. Ukraine is Party of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous
Wastes and their Disposal (ratified in 1999). Before joining this Convention, the Ukrainian Parliament
had already adopted a Law on Waste in 1998. However, after the ratification of the above international
treaty, the law was modified. In 2000, the CMU approved Regulation on Control for Transboundary
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their utilization and disposal. This document defines the procedure
for state control and operations, which could be made for waste disposal and utilization, and adopts
Yellow and Green lists of wastes based on the requirements of Basel Convention.

90. Generally, the key items of legislation that regulates waste management in Ukraine are:
 Law of Ukraine “On Environmental Protection? (1992). This Law provides a general provision for
    the environmental protection by preventing pollution with waste. It also requires obtaining permits for
    waste disposal, and stipulates waste’s reuse and recovery;
 Law of Ukraine “On Sanitary and Epidemiological Well-Being of the Population? (1994). This Law
    introduced the State sanitary norms and rules for maintenance of territories of settlements, rules for
    urban planning, and so on;
 Law of Ukraine “On Local Government? (1997). This Law defines responsibilities of local
    government, including elected (councils) and executive (administrations) bodies;


                                                                                                           25
   Law of Ukraine “On Housing and Communal Services? (2004). This Law establishes the principles
    of state policy for the provision of housing and communal services. It includes principles of equal
    access, reasonable pricing, saving resources, and so on. The law regulates transactions between
    bodies of executive authority, householders and stakeholders, who provide communal services (water,
    heat, waste management, and so on) as well tariffs’ regulation.

91. In 2010, the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine updated the statistical reporting on waste
management (statistical form No. 1 “Waste Management?). This form was unified and harmonized with
international reporting standards (Eurostat) on waste generation and management, and assumes obtaining
information from enterprises annually and based on the territory where manufacturing takes place.

92. In 2011, for the implementation of the Law of Ukraine “On Sanitary and Epidemiological Well -Being
of the Population?, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine approved “State Sanitary Norms and Rules for
Maintenance of Populated Areas.? This document established the requirements for sanitary cleaning of
populated areas, and rules of work on proper cleaning of municipal sites and state sanitary and
epidemiological supervision of public welfare and waste management. Holders of waste carry out
separate collection of waste, including hazardous waste in its composition, in accordance with the
legislation on waste and sanitary requirements.

93. That same year, the CMU approved a resolution on “Some Issues on Providing of Household Waste
Removal Services,? which specifies the rules of tendering contracts for waste collection services.

94. Another important step, made in 2013, was CMU’s adoption of “The Concept of the National Waste
Management Program for the Period of 2013–2020.? The law “On Waste? prohibits the transfer of
unsorted waste to landfills, effective January 2018,

95. In the framework of EU project “Complementary Support to the Ministry of Ecology and Natural
Resources of Ukraine for the Sector Budget Support Implementation,? analysis was carried out on the
development of the waste management system in Ukraine on the way forward to EU integration, and to
adoption and implementation of three main directives. These are Directive 2008/98/EC on Waste (Waste
Framework Directive), Directive 1999/31/EC on the Landfill of Waste, and Directive 2006/21/EC on the
Management of Waste from the Extractive Industry.

3.5 Recommendations

    1. Develop a regulatory framework that supports sustainable development objectives across sectors.
       A full assessment of laws and regulations should be undertaken to assess the environmental,
       social, and developmental impacts of the proposed regulations.

           a. Carry out legislative review to identify the key legal acts that need to be revised and the
              regulations that need to be adopted.

           b. Adopt necessary legislative and regulatory changes taking into account Ukraine's
              commitments under EU–Ukraine Agreement and in line with the agreed schedule of
              implementation.

           c. Establish a system for in-depth analysis, such as regulatory impact analysis for proposed
              pieces of legislation.

           d. Since changes to legislation and regulations will significantly affect the environment and
              environmental governance, these changes should undergo strategic environmental

                                                                                                      26
            assessment—not in accordance with the SEA law, which does not yet exist, but in
            accordance with the spirit of SEA.

        e. Carry out SEA of the proposed changes to legislation and policies and regulations

2. Put in place a system for setting environmental priorities at the national and sub-national levels
   that is linked to Ukraine’s economic growth and development priorities and places the country on
   the path to green inclusive growth. An important input into setting priorities is the cost of
   environmental degradation study (COED): the COED estimates in monetary terms the impacts of
   major environmental problems in Ukraine. The COED may be combined with statistical tools
   such as distributional surveys to determine the priorities that are linked to poverty.

3. Ensure integration of National Environmental Strategy goals in sectoral and regional plans.

4. Ensure the next National Environmental Strategy following year 2020 is prepared in full
   consultation with key stakeholders, and has clear targets and quantitative indicators.

5. Periodically review the impact of economic policy on the environment as well as the economic
   impact of environmental policies in order to mitigate the negative aspects in a timely manner.

      KEY ORGANIZATIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AT THE CENTRAL
LEVEL

96. This section provides an overview of the key agencies tasked with environmental management in
Ukraine at the central level.


4.1      Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources

97. The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) is the main state authority tasked with
the key role to develop and ensure implementation of environmental policy. For the performance of its
duties and functions in environmental management, MENR collaborates with Parliament’s Committee o n
Environmental Policy, Nature Management ,and Elimination of the Consequences of Chernobyl Disaster;
CMU’s Committee on Infrastructure Development and Environmental Policy, as well as the Ministry of
Energy and Coal Industry; Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food; Ministry of Regional Development,
Construction, Housing, and Communal Services; Ministry of Infrastructure; and other ministries and
organizations.

98. The MENR’s structure and responsibility have been undergoing significant and continuous change
over the past 25 years. During this period, the ministry was headed by 17 different ministers, which lead
to frequent reorganizations, renaming the ministry and its subordinated agencies/committees, and
organization restructuring. The last significant organizational changes were made in 2006, when the State
Hydrometeorological Service was transferred to the administration of the Ministry of Emergency
Situations (now the State Service on Emergency Situation under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine).
Another significant organizational change was made in 2011, when the State Committee on Forest
Resources (now the State Agency of Forest Resources) and the State Committee of Land Resources (now
the State Service of Ukraine for Geodesy, Cartography, and Cadaster) were transferred to the
administration of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. Still another change came in 2013, when the
State Environmental Investment Agency responsible for the implementation of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto Protocol was abolished.

99. The number of staff at the MENR also varied over the years. In 1999, the ministry’s central apparatus
had 170 staff members, in 2012 there were 234 staff members, and now the ministry has 211 staff
members. Table 6 presents the organizational structure and number of staff for the MENR as of the
beginning of 2015.

100.    MENR’s central apparatus fulfils its duties and functions directly and t hrough special authorized
executive bodies. The ministry coordinates the State Ecological Inspectorate, State Agency of Water
Resources, State Service of Geology and Mineral Resources and State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion
Zone Management. MENR also supervises three research institutes and nine state enterprises2. According
to the National Environmental Action Plan for 2011–2015, MENR together with public organizations has
foreseen a preparation of the Plan of Enhancement of the Institutional Capacity of the MENR during
2011–2013. However, the plan was not prepared in time due to shortage in budget.

Source. Order of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of 26.01.2015 No. 10 “On Approval of the
Structure of the Central Apparatus of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine.?

101.      The ministry continued to undergo changes:

         In 2010, president’s decree on “Optimization of the System of Central Executive Authorities?
          was issued that aimed to optimize the staff and financing of central executive authorities and
          address duplication of functions.

         This was followed, in 2011, by approval of several legislative acts that resulted in transfer of
          subordinated bodies of the MENR (State Agency of Forest Resources and State Agency of Land
          Resources) to the administration of other ministries, and liquidation of the State Service of
          Conservation Area.

         In 2012, the Parliament adopted the law “Changes to Some Legislative Acts of Ukraine
          Regarding Optimization of Powers of the Executive Authorities for Ecology and Natural
          Resources, included at the Local Level.? This law further revised the functions of the central


                                                                                                       30
           authorities, transferring some MENR functions to the state administrations, including the function
           of issuing permits regarding air emissions and water use, and so forth.

          In 2013, the CMU adopted a Decree on “Liquidation of the Regional Departments of the Ministry
           of Environmental Protection.?

          In 2014, the CMU approved another Decree “Optimization of the System of Central Executive
           Authorities?, by which the State Service of Ukraine for Geodesy, Cartography and Cadaster was
           established by reorganizing the State Agency of Land Resources of Ukraine. State Inspection of
           Agriculture and State Environmental Investment Agency were liquidated.

102.   Figure 4 below presents an overview of agencies and organizations coordinated by the MENR as
of August 2015.

103.    The State Ecological Inspectorate (SEI) agency implements state policy on monitoring and
control in the area of environmental protection, rational use, recreation, and protection of natural
resources. The SEI has 68 staff in the central unit and 2,452 staff in regional departments.

104.      Before a moratorium was announced on all government inspections in August 2014, the SEI
regional departments prepared quarterly and annual inspection plans that were then approved by the
central unit. The inspection plans take into consideration enterprises’ risk categorization (I, II, and III).
The inspectors carry out the monitoring based on the permits for each enterprise. If violation of standards
is identified, the enterprise pays a fine that is calculated based on a formula. A second violation results in
a fine and may result in legal action—for example, over the past year, the SEI in Vinnytsya submitted two
files to the general prosecutor’s office for legal action (however, both cases were ruled not in their favor).
The fines are credited to the central budget and, as such, become a resource for the environmental
protection funds at all levels.3

105.    At present, there is no clear coordination process between the SEI and the environmental
departments of the regional state administration but rely on informal contacts between staff. While SEI
inspection was an enforcement arm in the past, since the moratorium the cities rely on city services and
municipal police for enforcement of environmental conditions.

106.    The State Agency of Water Resources of the MENR implements state policy regarding the
management, use (including recreational use) of surface water resources; development of water industry
and land reclamation; and maintenance of state waterworks facilities, inter-economic irrigation, and
drainage systems. The central apparatus of the State Agency of Water Resources has 143 staff members.

107.    The State Service of Geology and Mineral Resources of the MENR implements state policy in

110.     The Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry is the main agency in the system of executive
authority, responsible for developing and ensuring the implementation of state policy regarding the
country’s fuel and energy complex—that is, policy relating to energy, nuclear-industrial, coal-industrial,
peat extraction, and oil and gas complexes. The central apparatus of the ministry has 373 staff members.
Relating to environmental issues, the structure of the ministry has a Division of the Coordination of
Scientific-Research and Nature Conservation Activity, Metrology, Certification and Accreditation. This
Division is under the Directorate of Strategy of Fuel and Energy Complex’s Development and Investment
Policy.

111.     The Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food develops and ensures the implementation of state
agrarian policy, agriculture and food safety policy; fishery and fish industry policy, protection and
restoration of water living resources; regulation of fishing and safety; veterinary medicine; safety of food
provision in the sphere of quarantine and plant protection; land relations, and topography-geodesic and
cartography activities; forest and hunting management; as well as monitoring and control of the agro-
industrial complex. The central apparatus of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food has 357 staff
members. The ministry coordinates the State Agency of Forest Resources; State Service of Ukraine for
Geodesy, Cartography and Cadaster; State Agency of Fishery, and State Veterinary and Phyto-Sanitary
Service.

112.    The Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing, and Communal Services
(Min-Region-Bud) is responsible for developing and ensuring the implementation of state regional and
housing policy; building, architecture, urban development, housing, and communal services policy;
implementing policy for the effective use of fuel and energy resources, energy-saving, renewable sources
of energy, and alternative types of fuel; implementing policies pertaining to topography and geodesy and
cartography activities, land issues, land protection (except use and protection of agricultural land); as well
as activity regarding State Land Cadaster and activity regarding renewal of the Donetsk and Luhansk
regions (Donbass). The central apparatus of the Min-Region-Bud has 383 staff members. The Ministry
has a Division of Household Solid Waste Management with five staff members, and a Division of Water
Supply and Sewage with six staff members. The ministry also coordinates the State Agency on Energy
Efficiency and Energy Saving.

113.     The Ministry of Infrastructure develops and ensures the implementation of state policy in the
spheres of air service transport, motor, railway, marine, river transports as well as tourism and health
resort activity. The central apparatus of the Ministry of Infrastructure has 262 staff members.

114.    The Ministry of Health develops and ensures the implementation of the state policy for health
protection and sanitary-and-epidemiologic welfare. The ministry approves the state sanitary, hygienic
norms and rules; standards of drinking water’ quality; radiation safety’ norms; and provide a hygienic
regulation of genic modified organisms, food provisions, medicine, and so forth The central apparatus of
the Ministry of Health has 260 staff members. The ministry coordinates a work of the Sanitary-and-
Epidemiologic Service of Ukraine, which has 63 staff members in the central apparatus and 6750 staff in
the regional departments in the regions.

115.      The State Statistics Service: the Division of Natural Resources and Environment Protection
Statistics within the Agriculture and Environment Statistics Department is responsible for environmental
statistics.

116.    According to the Law on Statistics (No. 2614-XII/1992), the SSSU has the following
responsibilities:
 Participate in shaping public policy in the field of statistics and ensuring its implementation;


                                                                                                           33
   Collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, storage, protection and use of statistical information
    on economic, social, demographic, ecological phenomena and processes place in Ukraine and its
    regions;
   Ensuring the reliability and objectivity of statistical information;
   Development, improvement and implementation of statistical methodology;
   Software development, improvement and implementation system of state classifications of technical,
    economic and social Information used for statistical observations;
   Creating and maintaining the Single State Register of Enterprises and Organizations of Ukraine
    registers and statistical respondents observations;
   Introduction of new information technology processing statistical information;
   Interaction information system of the state statistics information systems of state agencies, local
    governments, other entities and international organizations statistical agencies of other countries
    through mutual exchange information of methodological, software and technology and other works
    aimed at the effective use of information resources;
   Coordination of state agencies, local governments and other entities in the organization activities
    related to the collection and use administrative data;
   Ensuring the availability, transparency and openness statistical information, its sources and
    methodology of compilation; and
   Conservation and protection of statistical information.

117.     Statistical surveys in the field of environment and natural resources are carried out in accordance
with the Law on Statistics (1992), as well as in accordance with environmental legislation and a number
of international agreements. The SSSU collects data pertaining to air emissions from industrial stationary
sources and from mobile sources; forest, mineral resources; hazardous waste; expenses of enterprises for
environmental protection; and specially protected areas (Byfuglien J. et al 2012). The State Statistic
Service receives environmental data from the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, Ministry of
Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services, Ministry of Health, State
Agency of Forest Resources and other bodies. The key challenges facing the SSSU are coordination with
other key agencies, statistical education, outdated statistical templates, and legal restrictions particularly
to open data. Approximately 355 legal acts would need to be harmonized with the EU harmonization
process.

118.    According to the Order of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine No. 243 (2014) on “Approval of
the Forms of State Statistic Observations in Ecology, Forest and Hunting Sectors,? the following annual
forms of state statistical observations are approved:
 No. 1-ecological costs “Costs for Environmental Protection and Ecological Payments?;
 No. 1-waste “Waste Management?;
 No. 2-TP (air) “Report on Air Atmospheric Protection?;
 No. 2-TP (hunting) “Shooting Preserve Management?;
 No. 2-TP vodgosp (statistical form on water use, including discharge of waste water), which was in
    use since 1997, was abolished in April 2015.
 No. 3-LG “Forestry Activity?;

119.     A single state registry of enterprises and organizations of Ukraine—a computer-aided system for
the collection, storage, and processing of data on all juridical entities in Ukraine was created.

120.    The Hydrometeorological Service (Hydromet Service), now under the responsibility of the State
Service of Emergency Situations of the Ministry of Defense, plays an important role in air quality and
water monitoring. The Hydrometeorological Service implements the state hydrometeorology and
environmental monitoring policy. During the last 10 years, the institutional and technical capacity of the

                                                                                                           34
Hydrometeorological Service was changed significantly. Before 2005, the Hydrometeorological Service
was under the coordination of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, but since 2005 (and largely for
political reasons), this service was transferred to the Ministry of Emergency Situation. Since 2013,
through the reorganization of the system, the Hydrometeorological Service became a part of the State
Service of Emergency Situations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The number of staff was reduced,
and fruitful collaboration and coordination mechanisms with the MENR regarding environmental
monitoring were lost. Environmental monitoring, hydrometeorological activity, and implementation of
commitments as a member of World Meteorological Organization (WMO) could not be a priority for the
Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, which has other broad responsibilities.

121.     The Hydrometeorological Service of Ukraine implements its work in close collaboration with the
Central Geophysical Observatory and the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute. In the current
situation, full reliable information regarding air and water pollution could be found in the archives of the
Central Geophysical Observatory.

122.     The WMO Strategic Plan for 2012–2015 underscores the importance of improving the
hydrometeorological service in member countries by advancing scientific research and application;
strengthening capacity-building; enhancing partnerships and cooperation as well as strengthening good
governance (World Meteorological Organization 2011). The WMO encourages countries to develop
strategies for the effective provision and application of weather; climate and water information; and
related environmental services within the framework of improving the safety and well-being of peoples,
reducing poverty and protecting the environment.

123.     Within the system of Public Prosecutor's Service, positions of a prosecutor responsible for
control of compliance with environmental protection legislation were available in every oblast
(міжрайонний прокурор з нагл?ду за додержанн?м законів у природоохоронній ?фері ), but in view
of an on-going reform of public prosecutor's service it is not clear whether such function and position will
exist in the future.


4.3     Recommendations

      1. Establish a clear mechanism of coordination and monitoring activity in order to avoid double
         functions between different organizations, and consolidate this mechanism at the legislative level
         introducing appropriate changes to current legal acts.

      2. Strengthen MENR’s capacity in line with the reform and requirements of the Association
         Agreement between the EU and Ukraine.

      3. Strengthen the capacity of other central government organs that have responsibilities for
         environmental and natural resources management.

      4. Review the functions, responsibilities and subordination in the sphere of environmental
         management between the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and other ministries,
         agencies and local authorities.

      5. Enhance and provide appropriate capacity building and personnel training for state bodies
         regarding environmental management and principle of sustainable development at the national
         and local levels with involvement of private sector and civil societies. This activity should take
         into account all requirements of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine and the
         commitments that should be achieved according to this treaty.

                                                                                                         35

      OVERVIEW       OF   ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AT                           THE    SUB-NATIONAL
LEVEL

5.1    Environmental Priorities at the Oblast Level: Regional Action Plans

124.     Oblast (region) environmental action plans are sections of the Regional Plans for Socioeconomic
Development that are developed by oblast authorities in accordance with the Law on Local Government
(Pro mistseve samovriaduvannia), other laws, budget code, government resolutions and
resolutions/decisions of oblast councils and administrations.

125.     These (annual) plans are funded from the oblast Environment Protection Fund (EPF, Fond
Ohorony Navkolyshniogo Pryrodnogo Seredovyscha). Sometimes, these plans also receive funds from the
State budget. Due to extremely limited available financial resources, the oblast environmental plans could
not tackle any fundamental problems; consequently, the funding is allocated primarily for household
waste management programs, wastewater treatment facilities, and the preparation of documentation for
new nature protection areas. These plans are usually developed without coordination with national level,
except for those cases when oblast plans/programs will be funded by the national budget. A program for
liquidation of stocks of obsolete pesticides is one (and relatively successful) example of this latter kind.
Table 7 below provides examples of environmental priorities as identified in their respective Regional
Plans for Socioeconomic Development.

126.    There are examples of regional programs developed by the public (environmental NGOs,
academia, and so forth). These plans are often quite ambitious for the available resources. For example,
Poltava oblast program developed by the civil society listed 28 priorities, while the “official? program
developed by the oblast branch of MENR had six priorities and funding was not sufficient even for the
implementation of the six identified priorities.

127.    Several oblasts developed multiyear Environmental Action Programs. For example, in 2010,
the Volyn region MENR department initiated the preparation of a regional ecological Program “Ecology
2011–2015 and Forecast up to 2020? with the participation of numerous stakeholders. The total envisaged
funding for 2011–2020 was UAH 576.12 million (US$72 million), 16% of the envisaged funding was to
be obtained from the region EPF and 2.5% from the resources of enterprises. In December 2010, this
program was approved by the Volyn Council, with “recommendation to subdivisions of oblast state
administration (OSA), territorial branches of central government organs, rayon administrations and local
government to implement tasks and activities envisaged by the Program.? This formulation means that the
provisions of the Program would be implemented only if there is available funding, which is allocated
annually by decisions of oblast council. According to the report of the Head of Oblast Council, in 2012
only UAH 618,000 ($77,347) was allocated for the year 2012, of them UAH 600,000 ($75,094) was
spent. At the same time, for 2012, the program envisaged UAH 84,172,000, of which UAH 66,247,000
from the state budget.

128.     Underfunding of environmental programs has been a problem that was identified in the
Public Environmental Expenditure Review (World Bank 2003). The report noted that programs
contained much more than could be funded, and actual implementation percentages were low – often
below 10%. Moreover, it was not clear that the programs that were implemented were those of highest
priorities. The report noted a tendency, which continues to date, of identifying a large number of projects
and programs that then compete for funding among each other (as noted above) (World Bank 2003).

129.     In practice, various stakeholders (like cities and other settlements, utilities, businesses,
NGOs, and so forth) submit their requests for funding to oblast authorities. In the past, these were
submitted to MENR’s oblast branch; now, they are submitted to OSA’s Department of Ecology and
Nature Protection). This authority prepares the list of properly prepared requests and then the Ecological
Commission of the Oblast Council with participation of other commissions and people deputies as needed
allocates funding for some proposals. In most cases, more influential people deputies lobby decisions in
favor of their constituencies. However, even if the funding were allocated, quite often the project, for
various reasons, would not be implemented. A typical reason for such non-implementation was the
cumbersome system of tendering and that the money was made available to the implementing agency too
late in the year, and not enough time remained to do the work). Unspent money is not transferred to the
next year, so the project must compete for funding again.

130.     Regional priorities are often missing from the National Environmental Plan. However, even
if a regional priority obtains the status of a National Program, such programs are only partially funded.
For example, by the Decree of the President of 2010, the environmental situation around the city of
Kalush (Ivano-Frankivsk oblast) was designated an “ecological catastrophe?. A program for cleanup and
emergency works was started, but was discontinued. Only one component (liquidation of stored
hexachlorobenzene) was partially done, and now there are criminal investigations into the use of related
funds from the state budget. In May 2015, NGO “EPL-Lviv? reported that UAH 874 million spent in
2010–2013 for cleanup did not reduce hexachlorobenzene contamination of the environment.

131.     An assessment carried out in 2015 by Mama-86 with EU support (EU/Mama-86 2015) further
highlights the disconnect between national environmental strategy and environmental action plans at the
regional and district levels. The NES priorities do not translate into sub-national level priorities and vice
versa—that is, the process of the national priority setting and setting priorities of the national action plans
at the region and district levels seem disconnected (see Annex 3).


5.2   Decentralization of Environmental Management

132.     The environmental management system underwent significant changes due to the Law No. 5456-
VI (2012) on “Introducing Changes to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine with the Aim of Optimization
of Powers and Authorities of the Executive Authorities in the Sphere of Ecology and Nature Resources,
Including the Local Level.? This law amended a number of earlier laws and codes, including the
Administrative Code, Water Code, Law on Environmental Protection, Law on Nature-Protection Fund,
Law on Ecological expertise, among others. In addition, by this law, a number of functions (permits for
certain activities, monitoring, supervision, expert reviews, and so forth) were transferred from the central
government (MENR) to local government (oblast state administrations).

133.    This law was followed by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 159 (2013) “On
Liquidation of the Territorial Branches of the Ministry of Environment.? The MENR’s oblast branches
were abolished and respective departments in oblast state administrations and in the cities of Kyiv and
Sevastopol were created. The Law entered into force in May 2013, when the responsibility for
implementation of the state environmental policy in oblasts and Kyiv and Sevastopol cities was passed
from MENR to respective State administrations.

134.    From the second half of 2013, oblast state administrations started creating their departments of
environmental protection. For local authorities, only the general regulation on a “Structural Subdivision
of Local State Administration? No. 887 of September 26, 2012 was available as guidance, so there was no
clear regulation regarding the department’s structure or any detailed outline of functions, except that the

                                                                                                            40
department’s goal was to “implement the state environmental policy.? Many of these new departments
were named “Department of Ecology and Natural Resources,? which accurately describes their functions.
However, in some oblasts, the situation was different—for example, in Chernivtsi oblast, a Department of
Ecology and Tourism was created, and in Poltava oblast, a Directorate ( Upravlinnia) of Ecology and
Natural Resources was created within the Department of Oil and Gas Complex, Ecology, and Nature
Resources.

135.     The structure of departments varies from oblast to oblast; it depends on the decision of OSA.
Departments can have two or three directorates (upravlinnia), with three to five divisions (viddil) and
sectors in each directorate, and divisions and sectors not in directorates. Names of directorates, divisions,
and sectors are different in different oblasts. All oblast departments have divisions for waste management,
water resources, monitoring, protection of air, and so forth. Some oblasts created separate divisions of the
state ecological expertise (for example, Zaporizhzhya), while others combined this function with other
functions. Obviously, such diversity creates problems for interaction with the central government, which
is supposed to regulate the activities of oblast departments. Table 8 presents an overview of the structure
of OSA environment departments.

                      and local authority from
                      carrying out audits

136.    Therefore, at present there are several government agencies in each oblast with environmental
management responsibilities:
 Branches of central government agencies (oblast ecological inspectorates, oblast water resources
    directorates and/or river basin directorates); and
 Oblast departments of environment and natural resources (as mentioned above, the exact titles differ
    between oblasts).


                                                                                                                 42
Within the boundaries of the cities, the city administrations are responsible for environmental quality
(waste removal, street cleaning, green zones, and so forth) through their departments / sections of housing
and communal services, “amenities and nature protection? (Departament blagoustroyu ta zberezhennia
pryrodniogo seredovyscha); the names of the departments/sections differ across different cities, but their
functions are similar.

137.    Finally, prosecutors supervise the fulfillment of environmental legislation within the Prosecutor
General's Office of Ukraine (if they have not been abolished in current changes) (mizhrayonnyi prokyror z
nahliadu za doderzhanniam pryrodoohoronnogo zakonodavstva).

138.    Technical and some environmental aspects (environmental impacts) in the area of civil
engineering are regulated mainly by the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing and
Communal Services (MRDC), while the compliance control and enforcement of environmental legislation
are exercised by other executive authorities (MENR, State Ecological Inspectorate, State Geological
Service, State Water Resources Agency, State Sanitary Epidemiological Service, and so forth).

139.    A serious problem is a lack of continuity between oblast branches of MENR and
environmental departments of OSAs. It means that departments do not have legal information of what
was happening in the past (for example, decisions of ecological expertise, records of past performance
and violations of environmental regulations, and so forth).

5.3   Roles and Responsibilities of OSA Environment Departments

140.    The reorganization started by the Law of 16.10.2012 created numerous gaps between areas of
responsibility of national and regional (oblast) agencies. These gaps are not yet closed, partly because the
needed regulations have not yet been developed. Below is a brief overview of the key responsibilities,
which are discussed further in chapter 6.

141.     Environmental monitoring and enforcement. The function of OSA’s environmental
departments is to “participate in the monitoring of environment.? However, this function has not yet been
spelled out. The responsibility for issuing orders in case of violation of norms and regulations;
participating in commissions to authorize the launching new enterprises; or controlling transboundary
transactions remained with the central level (that is, MENR) and did not transfer to the new OSA
environment departments. At the same time, the national environmental protection authority can issue
orders to all entities, including regional environmental authorities (Art. 202). See section 6.2 below.

142.     Environmental permits and licensing. The Law of 16.10.2012 divided responsibilities for
environmental permits between central authorities and OSA departments. Most functions remain with the
central authority (Art. 202). The central government authority also has the power, by issuing a mandatory
order (prypys), to cancel any permit or license approved by regional organs. See section 6.3 below.

143.    Environmental impact assessment. The Law of 16.10.2012 envisages that both central
government agency (MENR) and regional (oblast) departments of OSA can perform state ecological
expertise (articles 201–204). The central government authority conducts state ecological expertise for
those projects, “for which the decision is taken by the Cabinet of Ministers.? There is no regulatory
document (similar to the Resolution of CMU of 31.10.1995 No. 870 “On the Procedure of Submission
Documentation for State Ecological Expertise?) that defines the authority of OSA departments.
Consequently, departments do not have the legal grounds to perform this function, and most of them do
not perform this function. The most recent posts about decisions regarding ecological expertise that
appear on departments' Web sites are dated 2013. However, there are OSA departments that conduct state

                                                                                                         43
ecological expertise (for example, in Poltava and Zaporizhzhya). This is discussed further in section 6.4
below.

144.    Environmental disclosure. Environmental departments share information they have with the
public (upon request or through their Web sites), but often they do not have the requested information.
This lack of information is aggravated by the fact that archives of former oblast branches of MENR have
not been transferred to oblast departments.

5.4   Coordination with Sectoral Units / Departments

145.    Each oblast has several agencies with responsibilities for natural resources, permitting, control,
and enforcement. There is no procedure to provide coordination among them. OSA’s environmental
departments work more closely with the oblast branches of SWRA. There is virtually no coordination
between oblast departments of environment and other agencies. Although oblast departments are by law
“regulated? by MENR, coordination mechanisms between the MENR and the newly established OSA
environmental departments need to be put in place and strengthened.

146.    Cooperation between OSA Departments and SEI. Another issue is cooperation between OSA
departments and oblast branches of SEI. This cooperation was rather weak between oblast branches of
MENR and SEI (for example, there was no requirement that information about approved decisions of
ecological expertise or permits issued to enterprises by oblast branches of MENR be made known to SEI.
Cooperation became even more problematic, because these two agencies belong to different authorities
(regional and national).

5.5 Recommendations

147.     The present system of environmental management at the sub-national level requires considerable
effort to develop and organize: legislative acts are not consistent, regulatory acts are often missing,
functions of various agencies are not clearly defined which results in gaps for some functions on one
hand, and overlap with the central level functions on the other. The process of instituting changes to
legislation and introducing new laws is ongoing, and changes become even more frequent because of the
process of adaptation of Ukrainian legislation to European norms.

148.    According to the Plan of Ukrainian President and the Government, by the end of 2015 the process
of decentralization (based on necessary amendments to Constitution and other laws) should be underway.
Decentralization will most likely change territorial system, the balance of power between national and
local authorities in many areas of responsibility, budget procedures and so forth. It is unlikely that current
problems of environmental management could be resolved before the reshuffling of the whole
government system has been completed (or at least until most fundamental changes have been made).

1. Clarify the responsibilities of the regional OSA departments as per current legislation.

2. Establish a consultation mechanism that will encompass broad spectrum of stakeholders, including
   central level authorities, private sector, civil society, academia and research. This consultation
   mechanism will be critical for ensuring broad participation in defining functions, roles, and
   responsibilities, and should be launched as early as possible, so that possible approaches, proposals,
   and ideas are already at hand when the need for them arises—that is, when the shape of a new
   administrative and government system is fixed. Such consultation would also create better contacts
   and understanding among practitioners throughout the country, as well as within each area of
   environmental management.


                                                                                                           44
3. Delineate responsibilities between the central and regional levels of environmental management,
   including with central authorities, departments of central authorities in the regions, other regional and
   local level authorities.

4. Establish a clear mechanism of coordination and monitoring activity in order to avoid any gaps and
   reduce duplication of functions between different organizations, and consolidate this mechanism at
   the legislative level introducing appropriate changes to current legal acts.

5. Provide technical assistance to regional organs and municipalities in implementation of their
   responsibilities in the area of environmental management in a continuous process.

      KEY ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT TOOLS
149.   This section looks at the key environmental management policy tools that are available / used in
Ukraine for environmental management.


6.1   Environmental Regulations and Standards

150.    Since Ukraine gained its independence, environmental regulations and standards were based on
the use of maximum allowable concentrations, which were considered for permitting system. In 2001,
new changes were introduced to the Law “On Atmospheric Air Protection? taking into account air
pollutants’ emissions from existing and new installations. Ukraine started on the path towards
implementation and adoption of the EU IPPC Directive and use of the principle of Best Available
Techniques (BAT).

151.      The same year, CMU adopted the Decree “About Approval of Procedure for the Development
and Adoption the Standards for Pollutants’ Emissions Limits from Stationary Sources.? MENR’s Order in
2004 approved the list of installations, for which these standards are developed. For the installations from
this list, the technological standards are developed and approved by the MENR. During 2008 –2012,
various technological standards for different types of installation and facilities were adopted.

152.    MENR’s Order No. 309 on June 27, 2006, approved Standards for Pollutants’ Emissions Limits
from Stationary Sources (SPELSS) for existing and new installations. Emission limits are specified for
particulate matter, carcinogenic pollutants, gaseous inorganic pollutants, and organic pollutants.
Generally, 139 pollutants are regulated in Ukraine.

153.    The Water Code and three CMU decrees regulate Standards for Pollutants’ Discharge Limits in
Water Bodies. These decrees are “About the Procedure of Development and Approval of Standards for
Pollutants’ Discharge Limits and a List of the Pollutants, which Discharges are Regulated? (1996),
“About Approval of the Rules of the Protection of Surface Waters from Pollution by the Return Waters?
(1999), and “Guidance about the Procedure of Development and Approval of Standards for Pollutants’
Discharge Limits in Water Bodies with Return Waters,? adopted by the MENR in 1994.

154.    In all cases, it is mandatory to regulate 10 pollutants in return waters’ discharge. In addition, a
regulation includes biological oxygen’ demand, chemical oxygen’ demand as well as indicators of
bacteriological pollution, toxicity and radioactivity’ levels. There are also 132 pollutants, which discharge
should be stopped, and they are regulated only in case of their detection in return waters. Additional 155
pollutants, which discharge should be reduced, are regulated in case of presence these substances in return
waters.


6.2   Environmental Monitoring and Compliance Enforcement

155.    Ukraine’s Environmental Protection law foresees the establishment of state environmental
monitoring system, conducting observations on environmental conditions and level of pollution. The
foundations for the operation of an environmental monitoring system are established in the CMU Decree
on “State Environmental Monitoring System?, which was adopted in 1998 and last updated in 2013.
Following are the key legislative acts that regulate environmental monitoring:
 CMU’s decree “Approval of Provision of Land Monitoring? (1993);
 CMU’s decree “Approval of Provision of Conducting State Water Monitoring? (1996);


                                                                                                          46
     CMU’s decree “Approval of Provision of Organizing and Conducting Monitoring for Protection of
      Atmospheric Air? (1999); and
     CMU’s decree “Approval of Provision of Soil Monitoring of Agricultural Soils? (2004).

156.   Ten state entities provide the functions of the State Environmental Monitoring System in
Ukraine:

     Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources
     State Agency of Water Resources
     State Service of Geology and Mineral Resources
     State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management
     State Emergency Service
     Sanitary-and-Epidemiologic Service of the Ministry of Health Protection
     Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food
     State Agency of Forest Resources
     Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services
     State Service of Ukraine for Geodesy, Cartography and Cadaster

157.    In 2007, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (CMU) approved the State-Targeted Ecologic
Program of Conduction of Environmental Monitoring. The Program covered the period 2008–2012 and
has not been updated for subsequent time periods.

Air quality monitoring

158.     Air quality monitoring is carried out in accordance with CMU’s decree on “Organizing and
Conducting Monitoring in the Sphere of Atmospheric Air Protection? (1999) by the State Service of
Emergency Situations of the Ministry of Defense, the Sanitary-and-Epidemiologic Service, and
MENR, as well as by enterprises and organizations whose activity could lead to negative impacts on air
quality.

159.    By CMU’s decree on “Approval of Provision about State Environmental Monitoring System?
(1998), the State Service of Emergency Situations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine monitors air
pollution and the chemical composition of atmospheric precipitation (including snow cover). Air quality
monitoring is conducted in 53 cities of Ukraine at 162 stationary stations, 2 route posts and 2 stations of
transboundary transport.4 Mandatory monitoring of air quality at the national level covers seven
pollutants: dust, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon oxide (CO), formaldehyde (H2CO),
lead, and benzopyrene. Some stations monitor additional pollutants. According to the Provision of
Organizing and Conducting a Monitoring in the Sphere of Atmospheric Air Protection, a monitoring of
other 29 pollutants is carried out only at the oblast level according to the regional programs.

160.    The SEI conducts selective sampling analysis of emission sources, and measures more than 65
elements (Decree of the President of Ukraine of 13.04.2011 No. 454/2011 “On Regulations on State
Ecological Inspectorate of Ukraine?). In 2012, the instrument-and-laboratory control for compliance with
the standards for pollutants’ emissions limits was conducted by the SEI at 1,054 enterprises with 2,800
stationary sources of emissions checked and 13,000 samples conducted. Violations of standards were
observed at 431 sources of emissions, and additionally, 279 sources of emissions worked without
obtaining permits. The largest number of enterprises was checked by inspection in the following regions:
Dnipropetrovsk – 105, Donetsk – 90, Chernivtsi – 72, Zakarpattya – 72, Zaporizhzhya – 67, Lviv – 65,

and Kharkiv – 56. The smallest number of enterprises was checked in Rivne – 13, Vinnytsya – 12, and
Poltava – 17 (MENR 2013a).

161.    The Sanitary-and-Epidemiologic Service of the Ministry of Health Protection of Ukraine
provides monitoring of ambient air quality in the residential and recreation zones, including areas of
highways, sanitary-hygienic zones, territories of schools, medical building, and so forth Additionally,
analysis of atmospheric air quality could be conducted in case of citizen complaints.5,6,7

Water Quality Monitoring

162.    The State Service of Emergency Situation conducts monitoring of hydro-chemical water
conditions at 151 water bodies; hydro-biological observations at 45 water bodies measuring 46
elements/parameters; and observations of chronic toxicity are provided for 8 water bodies. In addition,
indicators of radioactive pollution of surface water are followed. Monitoring of coastal waters is carried
out at several Black Sea and Azov Sea monitoring stations, where from 16 to 26 hydro-chemical
parameters and bed silt are measured.8

163.     State Ecological Inspectorate collects water samples from the water bodies and receives data for
60 measured parameters. State Ecological Inspectorates of the Protection of Black and Azov seas have
their own observation systems. They coastal water samples are collected monthly and analysis of impact
of pollution sources is carried out, as well as monitoring of pollution discharge from the ships and
pollution from oil and gas production.9 In 2012, the instrument-and-laboratory control for compliance
with the standards for pollutants’ discharge limits was conducted by the State Ecological Inspectorate at
1,228 enterprises, at which 1,514 effluent water discharges were checked. The largest number (157) of
inspections took place in Dnipropetrovsk region; 143 took place in the Donetsk region, and another 143
took place in the Lvov region. The smallest number (9) of inspections was conducted in Sevastopol City,
and nine were conducted in the Volyn region. The largest number of instances in which standards were
exceeded was observed in the Ternopol, Dnipropetrovsk, and Donetsk regions, and the smallest number
of instances in which standards were exceeded was observed in the Kharkiv and Cherkassy regions.10

164.    The State Agency of Water Resources of Ukraine monitoring water quality in rivers, water
reservoirs, canals, irrigation systems, water supply systems, transboundary watercourses and water bodies
in the area of impact of nuclear power plants. Water quality control is conducted for physical and
chemical parameters at 72 water reservoirs, 164 rivers, 14 irrigation systems, and 5 canals of complex
purpose.

165.    The Sanitary-and-Epidemiologic Service provides observations of sources of centralized and
decentralized water supply (including groundwater) as well as recreation zones along the rivers, marine
and water reservoirs.

166.   The State Service of Geology and Mineral Resources of the MENR conducts monitoring of
groundwater, particularly the assessment of groundwater incidence and its geochemical composition by
measuring 22 parameters, including heavy metals and pesticides.11

167.    Self-Monitoring: In 2012, a draft CMU decree on “Approval of Procedure for Conducting
Environmental Monitoring by the Enterprises, Agencies and Organizations that Have or May Have
Adverse Impact on the Environment? was prepared with the objective of improving the normative base in
environmental monitoring. This legal act foresees the establishment of a single procedure for carrying out
monitoring in order to observe the impact of industrial companies’ activit y on the environment, and
provide the efficient submission of information. However, this document has not been adopted as of
writing of this report (August 2015).

Environmental Monitoring at the Oblast Level:

168.    OSA’s Environmental Departments have the function of “Participation in the monitoring of
environment,? but this function has not been specified yet. As discussed above, a number of other central
and regional government agencies have various responsibilities in the area of environmental monitoring
(MENR, SEI, SWRA, and other units responsible for forestry, fisheries, land resources,
hydrometeorology, and geology). At present, oblast councils do not provide funding for environmental
monitoring (for environmental departments), and a similar issue exists at SEI’s oblast branches, which do
not receive funding from national SEI.

169.     Enforcement: Because of the reform of 2012, OSA environmental departments lost authority to
issue orders in case of violation of norms and regulations, including violations of conditions of licenses,
resource use or emissions. Oblast level environmental authorities do not participate in the work of
commissions that authorize launching new enterprises or buildings or objects of infrastructure; they do
not have control over transboundary transactions even if these transactions take place on their territory.
All these responsibilities stay with the national authorities. At the same time, the MENR can issue orders
to all subjects, including regional environmental authorities (Art. 202).

170.    A serious problem is a lack of continuity between oblast branches of MENR and environmental
departments of OSAs. It means that departments do not have legal information of what was happening in
the past (for example, decisions of ecological expertise, records of past performance and violations of
environmental regulations, and so forth).

171.    Another issue is cooperation between departments of OSA and oblast branches of SEI. This
cooperation was rather weak between oblast branches of MENR and SEI (for example, there was no
requirement that information about approved decision of ecological expertise or permits issued to
enterprises by oblast branches of MENR was made known to SEI). Now cooperation becomes even more
problematic because two agencies belong to different authorities (regional and national).

172.    The Provision about State Environmental Monitoring System, adopted by the CMU in 1998 and
updated in 2013 refers to collaboration between different stakeholders regarding monitoring information,
however, there is no clear responsibilities and enforcement between the state bodies at national and
regional levels, particular in case of last administrative reforms and review of functions between different
organizations in environmental sphere;

Moratorium on Inspections

                                                                                                         49
173.    In August 2014, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine imposed a moratorium on inspections of the
enterprises and organizations by the State Inspections till the end of year: inspections may only be carried
out based on a court decision.12 Later, the Law of Ukraine13 established that inspections of enterprises
during January–June 2015 could be conducted only with CMU’s permission or by request of the
enterprise. These changes affect the work of the State Ecological Inspectorate, which does not have right
to inspect enterprises for their adherence to environmental standards.

Collaboration

174.    Collaboration between ministries, agencies, and other state organizations is mostly conducted by
the use of established intergovernmental commissions, working groups in different issues, participation in
the round tables, joint conferences and events as well as by the official correspondence (request of
information, agreement a draft law, and so forth) and informal contacts. For the purpose of coordination
and collaboration on environmental monitoring between all stakeholders, in 2001 the Interagency
Commission on Environmental Monitoring was established by the CMU’s decree. However, this
Commission was liquidated in 2010.

175.    The MENR concluded bilateral agreements with other ministries and agencies (for instance, with
the State Service of Emergency Situations, Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing
and Communal Services, State Agency for Water Resources) and developed relevant regulations of
information exchange between the stakeholders. MENR gathers all information, which is passed to the
Information Analytical Center (IAC) of the MENR.14 Based on the received data, the ministry issues the
information-analytical overview “Environmental Conditions in Ukraine? and publishes it on MENR’s
Web site. Unfortunately, access to the IAC’s information for the public is limited and requires receiving a
login and password. Additionally, IAC’s functioning and issuance of the information-analytical overview
depends on the availability of funding to support this activity. Thus, the IAC’s Web site was last updated
in July 2014, and the last information-analytical overview “Environmental Conditions in Ukraine? was
published on MENR’s Web site for the first quarter of 2013.


6.3     Environmental Permits and Licensing

176.    Environmental licensing system in Ukraine is characterized by a large number of permits that are
issued by government authorities.

177.     Key permits include the following:
        Permit for the development of standards for the emission of pollutants from stationary sources;
        Permit for the emissions of pollutants from stationary sources to atmospheric air;
        Permit for special water use;
        Permit for the development of pollution discharge limits in water bodies;
        Permit for waste storage and utilization; and others.

178.    In total, 59,219 permits were issued by the MENR and its regional departments (which are
liquidated now) for special use of natural resources in 2012 (MENR 2013a).

179.    Environmental Permits and Licensing at the Oblast Level: By the Law No. 5460-VI of October
16, 2012, responsibilities for environmental permits were divided between the central government and
OSA departments. Most environmental licensing functions remained with the central agency (Art. 202).
Central government also maintained the authority to cancel, by issuing a mandatory order ( prypys), any
permit or license approved by regional authorities. Table 9 provides a list of permits / licenses within the
realm of responsibility of the OSA environmental departments:

180.     The table above is by no means exhaustive, and many issues remain unresolved (as is seen from
the description of permits above) as of the time of writing of this report (August 2015). Regulations are
being prepared and approved by local authorities, and these should be developed and approved by every
oblast. For example, in Lviv, oblast regulation on “administrative service? “Permit for emissions in the air
for enterprises of groups II and III? was approved by the Head of Lviv OSA on March 10, 2015, and on
the lease of water objects on April 23, 2015. A new law “On licensing of certain business activities?
should enter into force on June 28, 2015, but there are still no regulatory documents to clarify the
responsibilities of oblast environmental departments.

181.     Below is an overview of the key permits:

182.    Air Emissions Permits: In 2002, the CMU adopted a Decree on “approval of the procedure for
works and payment associated with the issuance of permits for emissions of pollutants into the
atmosphere from stationary sources, keeping records of number of enterprises, organizations, and
individual entrepreneurs who have received such permits? that established a single mechanism for the
issuance of permits.

183.    According to the Law “On Atmospheric Air Protection,? industrial companies should obtain an
air emissions permit. Before 2013, such permits were issued by the MENR’s regional departments.
However, after the regional departments were abolished in 2013, the permits for Group I (enterprises,
which are at the state recordkeeping and should implement environmental safety technology) are issued
by the MENR, and permits for groups II and III are issued by the oblast state administrations within a

                                                                                                         51
period of thirty calendar days. The issuance of a permit requires receiving concurrence from the Sanitary-
and-Epidemiologic Service during 15 days from the date of document receipt. The validity term of the
permit for Group I is 7 years, Group II – 10 years and Group III – unlimited. MENR keeps a record of
about 2,500 Group I enterprises, and 185 permits were issued in 2014 (MENR 2015b).

184.    Permits for Special Water Use: The main legislative acts that regulate the issuance of permits for
special water use are:
 CMU Decree on “Procedure of Approval and Issuance of Permits for Special Water Use?;
 CMU Decree on “Procedure of Development and Approval of Pollution Discharge Limits and the
    List of Polluting Substances, for which the Discharge Limits are Set?;
 Ministry of Environment and Nuclear Safety Order on “The Guidance on the Procedure for
    Developing and Setting the Discharge Limit Values for Polluting Substances Released into Surface
    Waters with Effluent Discharges?.

185.    As is the case with air permits, prior to 2013, permits for special water use were issued by the
regional departments of the MENR. The permit could be valid for a short term (3 years) or for a long-term
(from 3 to 25 years), depending on the situation and compliance with the pollution-discharge limits.

186.    The administrative reforms and the abolishment of the MENR’s regional departments have also
affected the issuance of permits for special water use. Oblast branches of the State Water Resources
Agency (SWRA) have lost most of their responsibilities after the reform, but the responsibilities of oblast
(region) and rayon (district) state administrations on these resources are still not clearly defined. Two new
laws entered into force in 2013: “On Delineation (rozmezhuvannia) of the State and Municipal Property?
and “On Aquaculture?. However, no regulatory acts were developed, so lease agreements on water
objects could not be reregistered in accordance with the new laws. Overall responsibility stays with the
SWRA in Kyiv, which simply cannot cope with number of water objects (over 1,000 in each oblast). At
the same time, oblast branches have only advisory voice at best.

187.     Only the MENR could issue permits for the development of standards for pollutants’ discharge
limits in water bodies. However, following the adoption in 2014 by the Parliament of Ukraine of a Law
“About Changes to Some Legislative Acts of Ukraine regarding the Reduction of Number of Permitting
Documents?, there is no legal foundation at this time for obtaining such permits.

188.     Permits for waste management: In 1998, the CMU adopted a decree “On Approval of Procedure
for Development, Adoption and Review of Limits for Waste Generation and Disposal? (2013). According
to this Procedure, the MENR considers an application and draft limits on hazardous waste generation and
disposal; approves these limits and issues the permits for waste disposal. The limits for waste generation
and disposal, and permits for waste disposal, were cancelled in 2014 because of adoption of law on
“Changes to Some Legislative Acts of Ukraine regarding the Reduction of Number of Permitting
Documents?, and waste management permits were introduced. Currently, according to the Law of
Ukraine “On Waste?, local (municipal) authorities are responsible to issue waste management permits,
but do not issue them due to lack of regulations.

189.     Permits for use of NPF resources: The issuance of permits for use of resources at NPF objects is
still unresolved. Since 2013, OSAs are responsible for NPF objects on their territories, but the respective
changes to the Law on NPF have not been made. Therefore, there is no legal way for issuing even simple

6.4   Environmental Impact Assessment



                                                                                                          52
190.    The environmental impact assessment (EIA) process in Ukraine was developed during the 1990s
based on former Soviet regulations introduced in 1988. Several papers and books have been published on
the evolution of the EIA system in Ukraine and other post-Soviet countries (for example, a
comprehensive paper by Teel 2001). Most of the conclusions and recommendations of this author remain
valid for the need to strengthen the EIA system and bring it closer to international good practices.
However, the ongoing reorganization of the government during the 2000s, have further slowed the
strengthening of the EIA system in Ukraine.

191.     Environmental assessment in Ukraine is a two-stage process:
         i. OVNS – Preparing the environmental impact assessment documentation (referred to in
            Ukrainian as OVNS), which includes an assessment of potential impacts on the natural,
            manufactured, and social environment, and designing prevention, mitigation, and
            compensation measures. This step is the responsibility of the developer of the plan or project;
            and
        ii. Ecological Expertise (EE) – Review of the prepared document by authorized government
            agencies (state ecological expertise) and/or the public (public ecological expertise).

192.    Table 10 below presents an overview of the EIA system in Ukraine, as per current legislation and
the draft EIA law which is prepared in response to the requirement for harmonization with the EU
directives as result of the Ukraine–EU association agreement signature. Annex 1 provides also
comparison with the relevant EU and World Bank good practices in EIA.

EIA Legislation and Procedures

193.    Ukraine’s Environmental Protection Law (1992) formulates a mandatory requirement for carrying
out environmental impact assessment. Articles 26–30 specify the types of ecological expertise (EE)
(public or state); objects subject to EE; government authorities responsible for carrying out EE (the
central government agency for environmental protection, together with central government agency for
sanitary-epidemiological well-being); and the mandatory character of EE (“implementation of the project
without a positive decision of EE is forbidden?).

194.    Procedure of preparing environmental impact assessment documentation for full-scale EIA
(OVNS) is prescribed by the State Construction Norms DBN A.2.2-1-2003 on Conducting Assessment
of Environmental Impact (Ukrainian acronym OVNS). Annex E to this DBN (updated in 2013 by the
Resolution No. 808) lists types of activities and objects of high environmental risk, for which a full-scale
OVNS is mandatory. These State construction norms on OVNS (DBN A.2.2-1-1995) were first
developed and approved in 1995, when the EE law was adopted. They were reviewed and amended in
2001–2003, when some provisions were added that accounted for new legislation including the Aarhus
Convention. In 2002, the first and only "Guidance on developing OVNS" was prepared and published by
Kharkiv Institute of the State Civil Engineering Committee (UkrNDIINTV Derzhbudu Ukrainy).

                                                                                                                  56
Stages of EIA

195.    Screening. The Law on Ecological Expertise (1995) lists potential objects of ecological expertise
(Art. 27). These could be development schemes; development of sectors of economy; master plans of
settlements and schemes of regional (rayon) planning; drafts of regulatory documents that regulate
environmentally damaging economic activities; documentation for new technologies and genetically
modified organisms; and the proposed implementation of materials, substances, and objects that may
adversely affect the environment.

196.    The Environmental Protection Law and the Law on Environmental Expertise (1995) specify that
the preparation of the OVNS (EIA) document and state environmental expertise are mandatory for
projects having high environmental risk. CMU Resolution No. 808 (2013) presents a current list of such
projects and includes 33 types of activities (see Annex 8). As with the earlier list, there are no thresholds
for most of the activities.

197.   Article 31 of the Law on Regulation of City Planning Activity (2011) also prescribes that a full-
scale EA (with the state EE) is mandatory for high environmental risk objects and for hazardous objects.
These are defined by the Law on the Objects of Increased Risk (2001) as those with planned use of
hazardous substances and that pose risk of emergency situations.

198.    For other construction objects, a full-scale EA is not required. Construction objects are divided
into five categories of complexity: Objects in categories I–III do not require complex state expertise,
while objects in categories IV–V should be reviewed by the complex state expertise process, which
includes environmental analysis. Design documentation for such objects must have a section on
environmental impacts, and measures for their minimization, mitigation, and compensation in all types of
design documentation (such as a feasibility study, detailed design, and so forth). A panel of experts,
among them experts on ecology, energy efficiency, labor safety, and others as needed, review the design
documentation.

199.     For civil engineering (construction) activities that do not require OVNS , a set of design and
construction norms and standards, DBN A.2.2-3-2014 “Composition and Content of the Design
Documentation for Construction,? defines terminology, types of construction activities and objects, and
so forth. Annexes B.1.2 and D of these norms require developing a mandatory section on "environmental
impacts, measures for their minimization, mitigation and compensation" in all types of design
documentation (feasibility study, detailed design, working design). When the State Civil Engineering
Expertise (Derzhbudekspertyza) reviews design documentation, experts also analyze and approve this
mandatory section on "environmental impacts, measures for their minimization, mitigation and
compensation". Specialized State Enterprise "Derzhbudekspertyza" was created by the Order of the
Minister of Regional Development and Construction (MRDC) No. 358 (2007) and has branches in all
oblasts of Ukraine and a specialized branch for road construction projects.

200.     Scoping. No formal scoping procedure is described. All environmental impact documentation
addresses a list of topics in state construction norms. The DBN-A.2.2-1.2003 State Construction Norms
require that the following be addressed:
 Evaluation of three alternative locations before a decision is made;
 Environmental and sanitary impacts;
 Technical solutions for reducing impact, including use of cleaner production options, and related
    costs;
 Design and costs of the infrastructure needed for an industrial site; and


                                                                                                          57
   Transport of and availability of energy for the planned activity.

201.    There are many media-specific and other environment-related laws (land code; water code; and
laws on air protection, protected territories, ecological network, and so forth) stipulating that certain
requirements be taken into account when EA is carried out. Annex B of the state construction norms DBN
A.2.2-3-2014 lists these relevant laws and conventions.

202.    Content of EIA study. The first stage of the EIA process is an assessment of potential impacts of
    the proposed activity on the natural, manufactured, and social environment, and designing/planning
    prevention, mitigation, and compensation measures. The Law on Ecological Expertise and the State
    Construction Norms detail the key sections of the EIA. At this stage, there is no mechanism to
    integrate views of stakeholders such as local governments into the content of EIA study (except for
    land acquisition).

203.    Public consultation. Ukraine ratified the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public
Participation in Environmental Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters in 1999.
As a result, the MENR developed several regulatory acts that specify provisions of this Convention.

     Detailed requirements to organize public consultations on environmental matters are
      developed for only two activities. These are projects involving radiation hazard (Resolution of
      CMU of 1998 with amendments of 2006) and the development of cities’ and territories’ master
      plans (Resolution of CMU of 2011). In all other cases of full-scale OVNS, Section 1 of the State
      Construction Norms DBN A.2.2-1-2003 (paragraph 1.6 part 4, and paragraph 1.9) lists general
      guidance on how the public consultations must be organized. Paragraph 1.10 of DBN A.2.2-1-
      2003 provides for documentation of public consultations that must be included in the final OVNS
      report. The required document includes information about publication of the Statement of Intent
      (zayava pro namiry), information about public consultations, written and other comments from
      the public, justified decisions by the project developer in response to public comments, and
      information about the person providing public ecological expertise (if there was one).

     The project proponent and OVNS developer are responsible for organizing public
      consultations. The organization of public consultations (public hearings) can also fall under the
      responsibility of local government, and different procedures have been approved in different
      territorial communities (cities, towns, and villages). A local government authority could convene
      public hearings either upon its own initiative or upon request from community members. Such
      meetings could be organized at the village (sil'skyi shid), town, or city level. Decisions made
      during the course of such hearings are considered as recommendations.

     In practice, public consultations and hearings are rarely organized. The developer of OVNS
      publishes Statement of Intent (Zayava pro namiry) in a local newspaper (in effect, it could be one
      with small circulation). Except for controversial projects that affect local community, often there
      are no comments from the public and public consultations are not organized. Full-scale, well-
      prepared public consultations usually are organized only in case of large projects with
      international financing. In these cases, information on the projects, non-technical summary and/or
      full ESIA are also published on the web sites of the project developer and IFI, and comments
      from the public receive due attention.

204.    State Environmental Expertise. Article 28 of the Environmental Protection Law assigns the
responsibility for carrying out State Environmental Expertise (SEE) to the central government agency.
This differs markedly from Article 13 of the Law on Environmental Expertise, which stipulates that the
environmental departments of oblast state administrations and by the central government agency conduct

                                                                                                      58
the SEE. Article 37 of the same law specifies ways of implementing SEE, which may be carried out by
the following:


        (i)     Divisions of government agencies’ environmental expertise;
        (ii)    Special commissions, with participation of environmental expertise divisions and other
                experts (not from government agencies); and
        (iii)   Contracting specialized organizations to carry out preliminary analysis and preparing
                proposals for the government agency, which then reviews and approves these proposals.

205.     MRDC accredited private structures carry out EE for construction projects (except for certain
objects, such as those funded by public funds or some other categories lick nuclear power facilities, etc.).

206.     An issue that faces the ecological expertise for construction projects is the lack of a system to
monitor the implementation of mitigation measures set out in the "Environmental Protection" section of
project design documents. Local environmental authorities are not always notified of the EE, and follow
up only protests from the public. At the same time project proponents, with positive conclusions for the
construction, do not always understand the level of responsibility for compliance with environmental
legislation. However, it should be noted that there also are challenges that face the implementation of
measures in the case of objects that are state environmental expertise (the main difference is that in the
case of the OVNS the "Statement of Intent" and "Statement of Environmental Impact" are published).

207.    There is no special regulatory document on the rules of submission of strategies, plans, master
plans of cities, and legislative acts to the SEE (although the Environmental Protection Law lists these as
objects of SEE, and ecological expertise for such objects is carried out). These issues, as well as many
other provisions were regulated by the “Instruction on Conducting State Environmental Expertise,?
approved by MENR Order No. 55 (1995), but it was repealed in 2004, after entry into force of the Law on
the Order of Approval of Investment Projects.

208.     The review of OVNS and issuing a decision is an administrative service. The Information Card of
MENR on Administrative Service “Issuing a Decision of the State Ecological expertise? and the
Technological Card of MENR on Administrative Service “Issuing a Decision of the State Ecological
Expertise? administer this service. The former specifies mandatory requirements for submitted
documents, and the latter describes stages and timing of the work in preparing the decision and its
disclosure. The MENR and some Oblast State Administrations’ (OSAs’) environment departments
provide this service (at least this was the case in Zaporizhzhya, Poltava, and Sumy at the time of the
study). In Sumy, the regulation on this service, Information and Technological Cards of Sumy OSA
(similar to Information and Technological cards described above) was approved by the order of the Sumy
Oblast Department of Ecology, Fuel and Energy Complex and Nature Resources in May 2014. Some
other oblast departments (like Ivano-Frankivsk) do not provide this service, because, in their opinion,
there is no appropriate government regulation.

209.    In terms of number of SEE carried out, there is variance between the different OSA. For example,
the environmental department of Zaporizhzhya OSA issued 70 positive decisions during one year
(September 2013–August 2014). In most other oblasts (where industrial economic activity is less
intensive than in Zaporizhzhya), there were 2–4 decisions a month. In Kyiv oblast, the environmental
department's Web site lists (as of May 15, 2015) 86 decisions on various objects, but without indicating
when these decisions were issued. The MENR Web site provides limited information on the number of
expert reviews that were conducted by separate expertise or by participation in complex state expertise.
For nine months in 2011 (the months are not specified), the MENR Web site notes that 291 expert
reviews of design documents and 56 reviews of proposed regulatory acts and guidance were conducted.

                                                                                                         59
The total number of objects reviewed by the expertise department of the MENR was 1,260 in 2010; 393
in 2011; and 71 in 2012. (See table 11 for a comparison between countries of staff and number of EIAs.)

210.    The SEE conclusion indicates that the project documentation meets the applicable regulations. It
should be noted, however, that it may be developed on basis of information that is not fully correct, or the
design may change following SEE conclusion. There are no effective mechanisms for monitoring the
implementation by the project proponent of environmental mitigation measures envisaged in project
documentation.

211.     Disclosure of SEE Decision. The MENR and the OSAs disclose information in electronic format
on the SEE conducted. As there is no one unified database, searching for information on SEE decisions
requires accessing the Web sites of the MENR and the individual OSAs responsible for SEE for a specific
project. Moreover, the format and details vary between MENR and the different OSAs. The MENR
expertise page (http://www.menr.gov.ua/expertyza/), for example, publishes copies of the Request for
SEE forms submitted and copies of the SEE decisions. Similarly, the Zaporizhzhya OSA provides all
relevant information (name of applicant; activity; number and date of decision). Some other OSAs
mention only the number of decisions. At the same time, the MENR activity report for the first half of
2014 (the only one available on the Web site (accessed May 16, 2015) does not mention environmental
expertise at all (although the report provides number of licenses and permits for hazardous waste
management). Copies of the submitted and reviewed EIAs (OVNS) are not available in electronic format
and do not get disclosed. The MENR provides only copies of EIA in transboundary context on its Web
site.

some OSAs.

212.     Certification of EIA preparers. The preparation of environmental assessment documentation
(either OVNS or section of design documentation on environmental and social impacts) is the
responsibility of project proponent. The developer of OVNS or section of documentation must be
certified as “engineer-designer in the area of provision of safety for life and health of people, protection of
environment?15 by the All-Ukrainian Center for Licensing and Certification in Civil Engineering.16
Certificates are issued to qualified candidates with a diploma in engineering and 3–5 years of practical
work experience, and upon successful completion of the respective training module and an assessment.
This system replaced an earlier certification of firms system that required consulting firms to have a team

of professionals. The current system does not have such criterion, which many EIA practitioners in
Ukraine attribute for deterioration of EIA documentation.

213.    EIA is prepared either by the organization that develops the overall design, or by specialized
consultancy firms. As a rule, large design firms have licenses for preparing OVNS, as well as for all
accompanying works (like the engineering survey, technogenic and fire safety works, and so forth), so
they develop OVNS together with design documentation. Small companies subcontract specialized
companies to do the work. Currently, because there is no requirement to have a license, small companies
can have one or two certified engineers on their staff and develop OVNS by themselves. A number of
consultancies in all oblasts that offer services of preparing OVNS, usually such companies also can
conduct environmental audit, and prepare documents for obtaining permits. The procedures described in
paragraphs 212-213 apply only to construction projects and do not include areas such as mining
(boreholes, quarries, mines) and other activities (for example, hazardous waste management, activities in
water fund lands, etc.)

214.    Education and professional training. At present, there is no university degree in EIA or
environmental expertise, but elective courses at the undergraduate and master’s le vels are offered in
several universities as part of majors in ecology and environmental protection.17 The All-Ukrainian
Center for Licensing and Certification provides additional post-diploma training and issues a certificate of
“engineer-designer in the area of provision of safety for life and health of people, protection of
environment,? which is required for preparing OVNS.

215.    Within the MENR system, the State Ecological Academy of Post-Diploma Education and
Management18 (SEAPDEM), offers a number of training courses, including a course in environmental
expertise. Similar post-diploma courses are offered also by numerous other universities in all oblasts of
Ukraine (usually ecological expertise course contains also a section on preparation of OVNS). At
SEAPDEM, the Chair of Ecological Management, Standardization, and Certification of the Institute of
Ecological Safety and Management teaches a course on environmental expertise. Key audiences include
MENR staff, senior officials, and specialists from other central and regional organs of government, and
private sector staff and management. There is no information on the number of trainees who graduated
and their employment.

216.    From 1994 to 2001, within the framework of a cooperation agreement between the US EPA and
the Ministry of Environment of Ukraine, a series of 3-day EPA training courses “Principles of EIA? were
delivered to mixed groups of trainees (officials of the MENR and other government organs, and
representatives of local authorities, business, academia, and NGOs). However, later delivery of these
trainings was discontinued. In the framework of the same agreement, a demonstration project of preparing
EIA according to internationally recognized standards was carried out from 1997 to 2001, but the MENR
has not incorporated the lessons learned from this project into its work. Perhaps the major achievement of
the project was introducing procedures of information dissemination and public consultations in the
revised version of state construction norms on OVNS, issued in 2003 (DBN A.2.2-1-2003).

217.    Approximation of Ukrainian legislation to EU legislation. In September 2014, Ukraine ratified
the signature of the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement. Under this Agreement, Ukraine will cooperate
with the EU on environmental issues, and Title 5 “Economic and Sector Cooperation?, Chapter 6
“Environment? of the Agreement defines the scope of this cooperation. Article 363 of this chapter states
that “Gradual approximation of Ukrainian legislation to EU law and policy on environment shall proceed
in accordance with Annex XXX to this Agreement.? The MENR prepared a plan for implementation of

the Agreement in areas within the responsibility of MENR. The Order of the Minister No. 317 on
Implementation of EU–Ukraine Agreement (2014) approves this plan and the order includes provisions
for adaptation of Ukrainian legislation to the requirements of EU Directives: 2011/92/EU (EIA),
2001/42/EC (SEA), and 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information among others. In
accordance with the plan, a draft EIA law was prepared and public consultation on this draft was held in
April 2015. The law was not passed in June 2015 (as envisaged by the plan), and the draft has not yet
been passed to the Parliament Committee on the Environment (as of June 2015). A similar situation exists
with the Law on Strategic Environmental Assessment (due date December 2015). The preparation of the
draft has been completed, but consultations have not been scheduled yet as of June 2015.


6.5   Strategic Environmental Assessment

218.    There is no dedicated law or regulations on strategic environmental assessment in Ukraine,
although according to the Law on Environmental Expertise (1995) plans and programs are objects of
ecological expertise. At present, SEA is conducted only in limited cases, and mostly as part of the
requirements of international financing organizations. Thus, in 2011–2012, two strategic environmental
assessments were carried out for the projects of the Regional Program of Innovation Development of Lviv
Oblast and the Program of the Development of Small Scale Entrepreneurship in Lviv Oblast for 2013 –
2015 in the framework of the PRISM project (2015).

219.   The National Environmental Strategy up to 2020 foresees the improvement of legislative
framework for the implementation of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as a mandatory
instrument for strategic planning of the socioeconomic policy at the national, regional, and local levels.

220.    The MENR prepared a draft SEA law, which is being consulted on with key government
stakeholders. The draft law was also published on the MENR’s Web site in March 2015 for public
consultations. Per the approximation schedule, it is expected that the SEA law will be approved by
August 2017.

221.    A five-year project (2010–2015) “Building Capacity in Evidence-Based Economic Development
in Ukrainian Oblasts and Municipalities Project? (EBED Project), financed by the Government of
Canada, supports capacity in evidence-based economic development planning in Ukrainian oblasts and
municipalities. The EBED project aims to encourage sustainable development of Ukrainian oblasts and
municipalities by building the capacity of local authorities to use quantitative analysis and forecasting
tools in economic development planning. In the framework of this project, the Manual “Strategic
Environmental Assessment? and Methodological Recommendations were prepared for the public
administrations and local government (EBED Project 2015). The purpose of these documents is to give a
theoretical and practical knowledge on SEA to the current and future government officials. The Manual
incorporates lessons learnt from Ukraine’s first regional SEA, a case study from Dnipropetrovsk region
led by EBED, and includes the experiences of Canada and other countries on SEA implementation.

222.    An important tool to complement the SEA would be the requirement that any policy, program, or
plan be analyzed from the point of view of costs and benefits to allow lawmakers and policy makers to
assess the relative efficiency of the proposed policy, program, or plan from the point of the view of the
environment.


6.6   Market-Based / Economic Instruments




                                                                                                       62
223.    The Environmental Protection Law (1992) provides for the use of economic instruments to
achieve environmental management objectives. The Ukraine Environmental Performance Review reports
(OECD 1999 and OECD 2007) provide an overview of the environmental economic instruments in use in
Ukraine, these include emission charges (air emissions, discharges to water bodies, and waste disposal),
taxes for special use of natural resources, sanctions on environmental pollution, and excises and customs
duties on environmentally harmful products.

224.    Since the introduction of these instruments, the rates were revised several times. The latest
revision took place in March 2015, and tables 12–15 below reflect the latest rate update. In addition, as of
January 2015, a new 5% excise tax took effect on oil product and other fuels. The new excise duty applies
to buses, trucks, and electro-mobiles. The excise duty on new buses and trucks is EUR 0.003 per 1 cc of
an engine, EUR 0.01 – EUR 0.016 excise duty on electro mobiles, and EUR 109 per electro-engine.

225.     The State Tax Administration is responsible for the timely collection of the pollution charges, and
the collection rate is approximately 90%. The Budget Code (Law of Ukraine of 08.07.2010 No. 2456-VI
“Budget Code of Ukraine.?), updated in March 2015, establishes the distribution of the collected
environmental taxes as follows: 20% of environmental charges is directed to the state budget, 25% to
oblast budgets, and 55% to local administration budgets. Overall, the share of environmental taxes in
Ukraine’s overall tax revenue forms approximately 1.3%, compared to EU average of approximately
6.3%. See Figure 6 below.

226.    Table 16 below presents information on environmental payments (taxes and penalties for
environmental pollution), and table 17 presents percent breakdowns of current environmental
expenditures. The largest amount of payments was received for air emissions, but the largest expenditures
were directed to reducing the negative impacts of pollution on water resources. The “polluter pays?
principle is not fully developed and implemented in Ukraine yet, and this is an area for further work. The
public assessment report (2013) underlined that a key lack of environmental policy is the imbalance
between costs gathered due to pollution, and costs, which are necessary to eliminate the negative impacts
from pollution (Ageeva et al. 2013).

                                                                                                                       65
227.    A public environmental expenditure review carried out by the World Bank (2003) identified a
number of challenges facing the use of economic instruments in Ukraine. A key point in the Bank’s
review was that pollution charges were seen more as revenue-generating instruments rather than
instruments to achieve environmental quality. This was further confirmed by regional data disaggregation,
which showed that compliance rates with charges and fines were lower in regions with higher pollution
loads and where fines were less likely to be imposed.

228.    Currently, there is another change regarding target use of environmental payments. Before 2014,
environmental charges were directed to MENR’s Special Fund and earmarked for environmental
protection measures. However, the latest changes to Ukrainian legislation foresee that environmental
payments will be directed to the General State Fund (MENR 2015b).

229.     Market-based mechanisms/instruments are not well developed in Ukraine. The Government plans
to introduce internal emissions trading scheme between largest industrial companies. However, for this
moment, there are no legislative, institutional and technical backgrounds for this activity. Some market
based mechanisms were operated under the Kyoto Protocol implementation’ period during 2008–2012,
and it included joint implementation projects for emissions reduction, and international greenhouse gas
emissions trading scheme. Those mechanisms allowed modernizing the industrial companies, attracting
investment and reducing emissions. New opportunities and mechanisms will be developed under the
upcoming global climate change agreement, which is planned to be adopted in Paris at the end of 2015.

230.    OECD (2006) carried out a performance review of the State Environmental Protection Fund of
Ukraine. The review aimed to improve the management of the public environmental finance system in
line with international good practices. A part of the review was an analysis of the fund’s administration,
and of its operational strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the review proposed a reform plan to
strengthen the fund’s expenditure-management capacity. The review identified key issues to be addressed,
these included the lack of appropriate policy and institutional structure, and absence of a clearly
formulated national environmental policy. The review also provided recommendations to strengthen the
effectiveness of the state environmental protection fund. These included:
    1. Reduce the number of local funds and concentrate the resources at a national and oblast level;
    2. In consultation with stakeholders, identify a particular niche for the Fund to ensure that it plays a
        strategic role in the national environmental policy.
    3. Design a proper organization and management structure of the State Fund.
    4. Define the programs of the Fund in line with good international practices;
    5. Introduce a medium-term budget framework to allow for the smooth implementation of multiyear
        projects;
    6. Introduce and maintain regular monitoring and control of individual investment projects
        implemented with support by the Fund.


6.7   Public Access to Information and Public Participation

231.     In 1999, Ukraine ratified the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in
Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention). Access to
information is provided by publishing information in official printed matter and on official Web sites,
informational stands, and giving information to the public in response to official requests. However, not
all information could be open by the state authority to public access, and there is a restriction on access to
confidential information, and to secret and organizational information.

232.   The MENR publishes environmental information and the results of its work on the following
Web site www.menr.gov.ua. However, some information is outdated.

                                                                                                           66
233.     Any person and/or organization may request information they need from the MENR by sending
an official letter to the ministry. According to the Law “On Access to Public Information?, the MENR has
a responsibility to provide the required information during 5 days. If the information about environmental
protection is related to persons’ life and health, food quality, catastrophe, or emergency situations, then
the ministry should provide the required information to the public during 48 hours. In case the required
information is large and additional data are needed to be collected, the MENR could extend a term of
preparation of this information up to 20 days with informing the person or organization about this
extension in written form.

234.    Over the past years, civil society organizations noted some challenges in receiving information,
which include absence of responses from the state authority or just partial answers; failure to comply with
the terms of replying; scrambling ecological information by the state bodies and using a “classified
information? stamp; restrictions on receiving information about draft strategies, programs, and plans
(Ageeva et al. 2013 and Melnychuk et al. 2012).

235.     While making documents available on the Internet is important way of making data and reports
available for access and consultations, it has its limitations taking into consideration that only 32% of
individuals reported using a computer in 2012 and 35% of households have Internet access at home (UN
Data 2015). Moreover, there is gap between urban and rural areas in terms of Internet users: 82% of
Internet users live in urban areas, 37% of whom live in cities with a population over 500,000, while
Internet penetration in rural areas is only 18% (Freedom House 2014). For this reason, supplementing the
posting of documents online with other methods would ensure their wider dissemination. Such
supplementary methods could include the use of television and cellular phones, since almost 96% of
households own a television and 90% of households own a cellular device. (See figure 7.)

Figure 7. Number of Internet Users per 100 People (2013)




Source: World Bank DDP. Accessed July 21, 2015.

236.    In April 2015, the Government of Ukraine took additional steps to increase transparency by
granting free access to public information online in the form of open data. These government steps were
Law No. 319-VIII (“Amendments to Some Laws of Ukraine on Access to Public Information in the Form

                                                                                                        67
of Open Data?) and Law No. 313-19 (“Access to Information on Budget Figures in the Form of Open
Data?). These laws are expected to push government agencies to publish operational data, statistics, and
reports upon request. Data will have to be updated regularly and published on government Web sites and
on the national open data web platform at data.gov.ua. Additional regulation is needed however to specify
the types of data that will be public (Kyiv Post 2015).

237.     Public and non-government ecological organizations (NGOs) have the opportunity to influence
the decision making process by making their proposal to the draft legislative acts and reports, which are
published for the consultations on the state authority’s Web site. According to the Law “On Access to
Public Information,? the state bodies should published a draft legislative act or other documents on their
Web sites at least 20 days before the date of adoption a legislative act. When the state authority publishes
a draft document, it is necessary to point out the contact information of the person to whom the proposals
could be sent. However, not always the state bodies involve the public and in many cases comments are
not taken into consideration. For example, during adoption of the Law of Ukraine “About Regulation of
Town Planning Activity,? public opinion was not considered (Ageeva et al. 2013).

238.    Following the ratification of the Aarhus Convention, an important step was taken by establishing
the Public Council (Hromadska Rada) under the MENR in 1996. The Public Council fulfills the functions
of consultation and advising body and aims to ensure public participation in decision making for the
development of environmental policy. Staff members from the ministry have participated in the meetings
of the Public Council, which give the opportunity to receive the information and discuss strategic and
current environmental issues. Decisions of the Public Council were mandatory for the consideration by
the MENR. In 2012, the Public Council conducted seven meetings. Unfortunately, frequent changes and
appointment of new ministers lead to inefficient work and disagreement between the Public Council and
high authority (Ageeva et al. 2013).

239.    Another positive step was made in 2004, when Aarhus Informational Center was created in the
MENR’s structure. The Center provided ecological information and information about environmental
policy to all interested stakeholders and public. It also conducted trainings for state officials, prepared and
published information in mass media, conducted roundtables and conferences, as well as organized public
consultation regarding environmental impact assessment. In 2012, the Aarhus Informational Center was
liquidated, which impacted collaboration between public and state authority as well as fulfillment of the
provisions of Aarhus Convention (Ageeva et al. 2013 and Melnychuk et al. 2012).

240.    According to Ukraine’s NGO portal, approximately 1,500 non-governmental organizations, all
over the country, note “protection of environment? in their registration information (Single NGO Register
2015). The number is expected to be lower, since many of these are associations or clubs for
hunting/fishing.


6.8   Private Sector Engagement in Environmental Management

241.     Ukraine’s Environmental Protection Law calls for the establishment of an incentive mechanism
for private sector through the provision of tax benefits, loans, and so forth, if enterprises introduce a clean
technology production, develop and implement various energy-efficient and environmental measures.
However, public assessment of environmental policy (Melnychuk et al. 2012) underlines that this
mechanism does not work in practice.

242.    The National Environmental Strategy (NES) foresees the development and implementation of
incentives for enterprises by 2015, based on a system of environmental management, corporate social


                                                                                                            68
responsibility and environmental audit and certification. However, assessment of the NES’s
implementation demonstrated that this task of the Strategy was not implemented (MENR 2015a).

243.     Currently, the largest companies introduce by themselves such international certifications in
environmental management and quality as ISO 14001. The emphasis of ISO 14001 is threefold: (i)
compliance with legislation; (ii) prevention of pollution by avoiding, reducing, and controlling pollutants;
and (iii) continual improvement of the environmental management system. Figures 8 and 9 below show
the evolution of ISO 14001 certificates in Ukraine and compare the number of certificates per 1,000
enterprises internationally. There has been significant increase over the past decade in the number of
companies that obtain ISO 14001 certification in Ukraine (see figure 8). However, the number of such
companies as a share of total enterprises is smaller than in comparison countries (see figure 9).

244.   The adoption of environmental management systems can assist firms to obtain financing by, for
example, fulfilling the environment requirements of potential financial investors, enhance their
competitiveness through reducing reputational risks and improving efficiency, and access new clients by
meeting buyers’ environmental demands, which may further enhance the opportunities provided by the
EU–Ukraine Association Agreement.

245.    Support for private sector are currently provided through two projects: “The Public -Private
Partnership Development Program (P3DP)? supported by USAID19 and “Support Resource Efficient and
Cleaner Production Center (RECPC)? supported by the UNIDO and UNEP.20 Thus, in 2013–2014 the
regional work of RECPC focused on more than 20 industrial companies in the Kyiv, Odesa, Vinnytsya,
and Zaporizhzhya regions in order to assist them in implementing energy-efficient measures and the
concept of clean production.


6.9   Access to Justice in Environmental Matters

246.     The Civil Procedure Code (Art. 3) and the Administrative Code (Art. 6) provide the citizens of
Ukraine the right to seek legal recourse in cases of violation of their rights, freedoms and interests,
including in the area of environmental protection and environmental rights. However, the role of judiciary
in environmental matters is limited by a number of factors, including – the overall weaknesses in
judiciary that face Ukrainian judiciary – for example, the Global Competitiveness Index (2014–2015)
ranked Ukraine at 140 out of 144 in terms of Judicial Independence21 with a score of 2.0 out of 4.0.
Barriers include lack of legal support, the psychological barrier to accessing judiciary for environmental
matters, and lack of knowledge on court processes. Additional barriers are the perceived high legal costs,
restrictive judiciary procedures, a complex legislative base, lack of effective enforcement mechanisms,
and corruption as identified by EPL in their project on monitoring court cases related to the environmental
rights of people in the Lviv and Ternopil regions (Environment People Law 2010). The analysis noted
that a large portion of the cases surveyed during the survey period pertained to right to access to
environmental information.


6.10 Recommendations

247.     A key challenge facing Ukraine is expanding the range of environmental policy instruments and
mechanisms to foster green inclusive growth. Developing a portfolio of well-functioning environmental
policy instruments, that include a mix of command and control and market based instruments, supported
by community based and voluntary policy tools will help Ukraine to achieve its environmental protection
and sustainable growth objectives and would create incentives to address Ukraine’s priority
environmental problems. While basis for many tools is already there, as has been discussed in the sections
above, many of the existing tools require strengthening to ensure that their implementation is in line with
international good practice.

1. Strengthen the environmental monitoring as an effective tool for setting priorities and building
   demand for strengthened environmental management.

            a. Introduce changes to the legislation regarding environmental monitoring with clear
               allocation of responsibilities between all stakeholders regarding gathering and submission
               of environmental data and activity of Information Analytical Center, and provide
               appropriate financial resource for supporting this work and making monitoring
               information available to the public on the MENR’s Web site.

            b. Review monitoring parameters to harmonize them with the EU monitoring parameters.

            c. Revise the Provision on State Environmental Monitoring System, adopted by the CMU in
               1998, taking into account reforms of central government organs, administrative reforms
               and changes in functions between organizations at national and regional level. The
               Provision should reflect appropriate mechanisms of state, regional, public and private
               responsibilities in this area. Introduce changes to the legislation regarding environmental
               monitoring with clear allocation of responsibilities.

            d. Build capacity of government and regional agencies to gather environmental information
               and disclose it, and prevent the loss of available documentation and archives during the
               admin-reform process.

2. Streamline the environmental permitting process.

            a. Carry out the inventory of current environmental permits taking into consideration
               administrative changes and establish appropriate mechanism for issuing permits at the
               national and local levels in line with international good practice and EU directives.

3. Strengthen compliance enforcement capacity of relevant agencies at local and national levels.

            b. Develop appropriate mechanisms and instruments for conducting inspections by the State
               Ecological Inspectorate for the compliance with environmental standards by the
               enterprises.

            c. Strengthen capacity of environmental inspectorate on central and regional level (legal,
               technical, analytical, law enforcement issues).

            d. Ensure coordination between, on the one hand, the environmental inspectorate on the
               central and regional levels, and, on the other hand, other central and regional government
               bodies having a role in compliance monitoring and law enforcement over various natural
               resources, such as air, water, land, forest, biodiversity, fish, and so on.

4. Develop appropriate legislative framework and mechanisms for introducing a “polluter pays?
   principle and an integrated permitting system according to the Directive 2010/75/EU.

5. Strengthen EIA as a preventative tool and SEA as a planning tool.

            a. The draft EIA law being prepared within the context of approximating Ukraine’s
               legislation to the EU Acquis is a step forward that has the potential to strengthen and
               bring to international good practice the EIA legislation and practice. Nevertheless,
               managing decentralization reform requires institutional strengthening at the regional
               (oblast) level.


                                                                                                       71
               Adopt the new EIA law in line with the EU directive and international good practice.
               Supplement the Law with appropriate regulatory acts. Preparation of the new legislation
               and regulation should be carried out in close and intensive consultations with all
               stakeholders: sectoral ministries, regional and local authorities, business, and NGO
               communities. Consultations with stakeholders and the public on the prepared draft should
               be organized not only in Kyiv, but in other regions as well, and sufficient time for
               addressing comments should be reserved. Implementation of EU directives requires strict
               adherence to their principles. However, it provides quite significant opportunities for
               taking into account each country's existing traditions, practices, and approaches. Close
               work with stakeholders will be important for this, and stakeholders will have a forum to
               voice their opinions, and they will be aware of the nature of upcoming changes well
               before these changes become mandatory.

           b. Carry out a detailed review of the EIA procedures, roles and functions of various
              government agencies. In line with assessment recommendations, prepare standard
              procedures and technical guidelines based on the new law and agreed functions of
              various government and regional organs.

           c. Adopt the law on strategic environmental assessment and supplement the law with
              appropriate regulatory acts with involvement of local authorities, public and private
              sector.

           d. Establish a national EIA / SEA database that is accessible to all stakeholders. There is
              already basis for database in the MENR and some regional departments publishing
              information on the EIA (but not the EIAs themselves except for the case of transboundary
              impacts). The database should include information on preparation of EIA (that is,
              following screening) and should store information on EIAs, SEAs, and allow for
              searching by keyword, region, year, and so forth. Such a database would simplify the
              commenting by public and relevant authorities facilitate compliance monitoring and
              allow monitoring and evaluation of the national EIA system.

6. Build demand for strengthened environmental management and governance with public participation

           a. Enhance the implementation of a Law of Ukraine “On Access to Public Information .?
              Permanently update and publish information on the MENR’s Web site and Web sites of
              other ministries and regional organs in systematic way.

           b. Develop and implement clear procedures of information disclosure and public
              participation in environmental decision making, which would specify for each type of
              activity the scope of disclosure, mandatory level of public involvement, responsibilities
              of government organs and other stakeholders, mechanisms of addressing public
              comments.

           c. Strengthen the capacity of judiciary to address environmental issues.




                                                                                                    72

     KEY POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

248.    The institutional analysis has identified several key challenges that face Ukraine’s environmental
management system. Key among these are the following:
i) Enhance the legislative framework for environmental management.
ii) Strengthen mechanisms for setting environmental priorities linked with Ukraine’s growth and
     development objectives and reflect these priorities in environmental and sectoral policies and
     strategies.
iii) Build effectiveness of the environmental institutions by improving coordination and streamlining
     mandates across the different agencies.
iv) Strengthen environmental management capacity at the regional level.
v) Expand and strengthen the implementation of a portfolio of environmental policy instruments, with
     emphasis on economic instruments and mechanisms to foster good environmental practice in line
     with EU requirements.
vi) Build demand for strengthened environmental management and governance through public access to
     information and public participation.

249.     Strengthening Ukraine’s environmental management system will contribute towards Ukraine’s
compliance with the terms of the Ukraine–EU Association Agreement signed in 2014. It will also
contribute towards enhancing Ukraine’s competitiveness through clearer and more consistent rules of the
game where it comes to environmental regulation and bringing the system of environmental management
at the local and national level closer to international good practice.

250.    The ongoing decentralization reform and the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement create an
opportunity and an impetus for the much-needed reform of the environmental management system in
Ukraine. At the same time, given the multiplicity of priorities that face the Government of Ukraine, it is
essential that the Government of Ukraine is selective and strategic in addressing the different
environmental management priorities, which would be critical for this reform to be successful.

251.    To start, it may be essential to prepare and implement a Roadmap for Reform of Environmental
Management in Ukraine in the short to medium term (1–2 years). To achieve this, the following tasks
should be completed:

        Task 1: Carry out a functional review of the institutions involved in environmental management
        from the point of view of implementation of the EU Environmental Directives. In other words,
        the review should answer the question of whether the environmental institutions in Ukraine as
        they are can effectively implement the EU Directives. A public environmental expenditure review
        should accompany the functional review, to identify government resource allocations to different
        environment goals at central and regional levels.

        Task 2. Determine Ukraine’s environmental priorities linked to its growth and development
        agenda. An important input into setting priorities is the cost of environmental degradation study
        (COED). The COED estimates in monetary terms the impacts of major environmental problems
        in Ukraine. The COED may be combined with statistical tools such as distributional surveys to
        determine the priorities that are linked to poverty.

        Task 3. Apply EU requirements to environmental management, delineate responsibilities, and
        subordination and coordination in the sphere of environmental management of central
        government units (including MENR, ministries, agencies, and so forth); regional government;

                                                                                                       74
        regional branches of central government units; and local government (city, settlement, and
        village).

        Task 4. Develop a roadmap for necessary legislative and regulatory changes (prioritization,
        sequencing, and depth of necessary revisions/change), based on Ukraine’s identified priorities
        and taking into account Ukraine's commitments under the EU–Ukraine Agreement.

252.     Two great tasks facing Ukraine dictate the need for this Roadmap: (i) decentralization reform
shall transfer significant authority to regional and local (municipality) level, and (ii) implementation of
EU–Ukraine agreement will create a new legal and regulatory system. This requires a review of roles and
responsibilities of government agencies involved in environmental management and environmental law
enforcement. It becomes necessary to reform the existing Ukrainian post-Soviet institutional structure of
environmental management in such a way that it can efficiently function in significantly changed
administrative, budget and legal environment.

253.    On December 11, 2014, Ukrainian Parliament approved an Action Plan of the Cabinet of
Ministers (Програма ді?льно?ті Кабінету Міні?трів України), which is aimed also at implementation
of the EU–Ukraine agreement. Unfortunately, this Action Plan does not mention environmental issues
(consequently, it was criticized by many “green? CSOs).

254.    A number of central government agencies, regional authorities, and municipalities will have to be
involved in preparing and implementing the Roadmap. This can be achieved by establishing a task force
consisting of key relevant authorities under the Prime Minister or the Vice-Prime Minister of Ukraine.
Such a task force could be called, for example, “The Task Force for Preparation and Implementation of
the Roadmap for Reform of Environmental Management.? Table 18 below summarizes other
recommendations, which are recommended for implementation after key elements of the Roadmap for
Reform have been implemented.

Annex 7. Examples of Central and Regional Governments’ Roles in Environmental Management

Colombia: The National Environmental System (SINA) in Colombia consists of the Ministry of
Environment, Housing and Territorial Development (MAVDT) at the national level. The ministry was
created by Law No. 99 (1993) to consolidate key environmental management functions dispersed
throughout the national government. The MAVDT is responsible for overall national environmental
policy formulation and coordination. At the regional and local levels, SINA consists of 33 regional
Autonomous Corporations (CARs) and urban environmental authorities (AAUs) responsible for
environmental enforcement and water resources development, and research centers responsible for
collecting and disseminating environmental data. The decentralization of environmental management to
the CARs allowed the financial autonomy and facilitated local stakeholders’ participation in
environmental governance (World Bank 2007).

Netherlands: At the central level, the Dutch Ministry of Environment works closely with other ministries
and provincial and municipal authorities, among others, to set the national environmental policy and
propose national legislation to Parliament. It also develops guidelines (white papers) for municipal and
local authorities to formulate policy and regulations within their own jurisdictions. The provincial
government is responsible for translating guidelines into the regional context: develop regional policy and
draw up regional zoning plans; granting environmental permits; enforcement of environmental
regulations by large companies; stimulate the use of sustainable energy. The municipal government is
responsible and has the financial means to implement the national policy and strategy on environmental
management: prepare local regulations and implement and enforce decisions and regulations; water
quality and wastewater treatment; preparing regulations for implementing and enforcing the national
environmental regulations.

Poland: At the national level, the Ministry of Environment is responsible for developing national
policies, legislation, and supporting and monitoring policy implementation in almost all environmental
areas except land use planning; as well as water administration, policy for forest and mineral resource
management. The MoE is responsible for two specialized organizations, and oversees the operations of
the national parks, and of five central administrative authorities including the General Directorate for
Environmental Protection (GDEP) and its 16 regional directorates (RDEPs). The GDEP’s main tasks are
managing EIA and strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and overseeing the Natura 2000 network.
The regional and local authorities consist of three levels: regions (voivodships), counties (Powiats), and
municipalities (gminas). The voivodship Environmental Protection Inspectorates handle routine
inspections of large polluters; deal with large generators of waste; and spatial planning and land
development. County and municipality government authorities issue development consents and pollution
permits based on installation size; counties also handle small and medium-sized waste generators; local
spatial development plans; and inspecting small and medium-sized installations. Municipalities are also
responsible for municipal waste management; setting policy direction for local development; and in
consultation with the local RDEP issuance of EIA decisions. Any disputes in responsibilities between
local and regional authorities and the central government are handled by administrative courts. A key
challenge for decentralization of responsibilities is insufficient funding from central level to carry out
these responsibilities (OECD 2015).

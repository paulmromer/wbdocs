SRI LANKA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE

Spring 2017
Preface
          The Sri Lanka Development Update has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past six months in Sri Lanka’s economy, and places these in
          a longer term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy
          changes over the period, it updates the outlook for Sri Lanka’s economy and social
          welfare. Second, the Update provides a more in-depth examination of selected
          economic and policy issues, and analysis of medium-term development challenges.
          It is intended for a wide audience, including policymakers, business leaders, financial
          market participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Sri
          Lanka’s evolving economy.

Executive Summary




                        Sri Lanka has the opportunity to sustain growth, job creation and poverty reduction in the
                        medium term, provided it shifts from a public investment, non-tradable sector-driven growth
                        model to a private investment, tradeable sector-led model, and benefit from its location close
                        to the largest fast-growing economies in the world. To get there it needs to maintain macro-
                        fiscal stability and increase its resilience to natural disasters, while pursuing structural
                        reforms to promote competitiveness and attract more FDI, use policy instruments to support
                        the structural adjustment and protect the poor, and improve accountability.

                        supported by strong rebound in investment was able to partially mitigate the impact
                        of inclement weather conditions on real sector. However, external buffers remained
                        weak on account of a challenging external environment and continued low FDI
                        flows. Inflation has been rising since the second half of 2016 on account of drought

                        helped the country regain concessions under the Generalized System of Preferences
                        Plus (GSP+) from the European Union in May 2017. Amendments to the VAT law
                        were introduced in November 2016, advancing on the fiscal consolidation agenda.
                        However, some other vital reforms were lagging behind; these included introduction
                        of the proposed Inland Revenue Law, implementing the One-Stop Shop for FDI,
                        reforms to the investment climate and trade, SOE reforms such as for Sri Lankan

policy reforms.          with the IMF program will add to the confidence while helping reform the tax
                         system to pursue revenue led fiscal consolidation. Monetary policy has shown that it
                         stands ready to take appropriate action in the direction of stability. These
                         developments have contributed to an improved outlook.

                         Growth is expected to reach 4.7 percent in 20173 and grow marginally over 5.0
                         percent beyond, driven by private consumption and investment. The impact of past
                         high monetary growth along with the increase of VAT collection will increase
                         inflation in 2017 although low international commodity prices will maintain some
                         downward pressure.

                         The external sector is poised to benefit from the reinstatement of GSP+
                         preferential access to European Union and rapidly growing tourism, although the
                         drought could adversely impact exports and increase petroleum imports. Foreign
                         capital inflows to government securities and FDI inflows will help closing the
                         external financing needs with no Eurobond falling due in 2017. External buffers are
                         projected to improve, with emphasis placed on purchasing foreign exchange,
                         maintaining a more market-determined exchange rate, using monetary policy and
                         the sale of selected government assets.

                         The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 5.2 percent of GDP for 2017 creating
                         space for planned increase in public investment thanks to the impact of VAT
                         changes in its first full year of implementation. Further revenue-increasing policy
                         measures along with improved tax administration will help increase revenues and
                         reduce the deficit to 3.5 of GDP by 2020.

The     outlook     is External risks include disappointing growth performance in key countries that

                       conditions would increase the cost of debt and would make rolling over the
                       maturing Eurobonds from 2019 more difficult. Faster than expected rises in
                       commodity prices would increase pressure on the balance of payments and make
                       domestic fuel and electricity price reforms more difficult. On the fiscal side, risks
                       include the delay in passing structural revenue measures and slower than expected
                       improvement in tax administration. Finally, the increasing occurrence and impact of
                       natural disasters could have an adverse impact on growth, the fiscal consolidation
                       path, the trade balance and poverty reduction.

crucial for sustained   reforms. These key challenges are inter-linked and require a comprehensive and
and equitable           coordinated approach. Adopting a piece-meal solution to address the challenges is
growth.                 unlikely to be successful. Although a turbulent external environment, domestic
                        political onsiderations and institutional constraints on policy implementation make
                        it challenging, a strong political will and support of the bureaucracy could help
                        advancing the reform agenda. Steps are needed to ensure the support of private
                        sector, civil society and other stakeholders through improved communications on
                        costs and benefits of the reform agenda.

                        These challenges include:
                         dealing with the weak external liquidity position and refinancing risks through
                           managing liabilities actively;
                         improving the debt management function with requisite institutional, legal and
                           strategy frameworks to manage the costs and risks of domestic and external
                           debt portfolios;
                         staying on the fiscal consolidation path creating fiscal space for health,
                           education, social protection and other public investments, and mitigating the
                           impact on the poor by replacing untargeted effective subsidies to the non-poor
                           by targeted spending;
                         improving the economy’s competitiveness and promoting trade and FDI to
                           facilitate a shift in the growth model driven more by private investment and
                           exports;
                         making progress on and completing the already started governance reforms
                           such as Right to Information, the National Audit Law and the Public Finance
                           Law; and
                         enhancing the country’s resilience and disaster preparedness to deal with
                           frequent natural disasters more pro-actively.

Box 1: Sri Lanka: country context
Sri Lanka is a Lower Middle-Income country with a GDP per capita of USD 3,835 in 2016 and a total population of
21.2 million people. Following 30 years of civil war that ended in 2009, Sri Lanka’s economy grew at an average 6.2
percent during 2010-2016, reflecting a peace dividend and a determined policy thrust towards reconstruction and
growth; although there were some signs of a slowdown in the last three years. The economy is transitioning from a
previously predominantly rural-based economy towards a more urbanized economy oriented around manufacturing
and services.
The country has made significant progress in its socio-economic and human development. Social indicators rank
among the highest in South Asia and compare favorably with those in middle-income countries. The economic
growth has translated into shared prosperity with national poverty headcount ratio declining from 15.3 percent in
2006/07 to 6.7 percent in 2012/13. Extreme poverty is rare and concentrated in some geographical pockets;
however, a relatively large share of the population subsists on little more than the extreme poverty line. The country
has comfortably surpassed most of the MDG targets set for 2015 and was ranked 73rd in Human Development
Index in 2015.
The economy’s weak competitiveness is an issue to address. Restrictive trade policies over the past decade have
created a strong anti-export bias, which has been reflected in a dramatic decline in trade. While growth in Sri Lanka
has been strong over the past few years, it has been inward-oriented and based on growth of non-tradable sectors.
Sri Lanka also attracts a much lower volume of FDI than peer economies and the shortcomings in the investment
climate pose obstacles for new firms. Moreover, significantly large state participation in the economy has
implications on competitiveness in a number of sectors and labor market dynamics.
Low revenues critically impact Sri Lanka’s fiscal position. The major causes of this decline are the low increase in the
number of tax payers (less than 7 percent of the labor force and formal establishments pay income tax), reductions
in statutory rates without commensurate efforts to expand the tax base, inefficiencies in administration and
numerous exemptions. Low revenues combined with largely non-discretionary expenditure in salary bill, transfers,
and interest payments has constrained critical development spending have squeezed expenditure on health,
education and social protection, which are low compared to peers.
Sri Lanka has a 3-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program with the IMF, which is primarily focused on
increasing revenues. The program calls for fiscal consolidation; transition to flexible inflation targeting; and reforms
in public financial management, state enterprises and trade and competitiveness. The IMF announced that the
second review reached a staff-level agreement with Sri Lankan authorities subject to submission of a new Inland
Revenue Act to the Parliament by June 2017.
The government that came to power in 2015 envisions promoting a globally competitive, export-led economy with
an emphasis on inclusion. It has indicated the keenness to undertake reforms in the areas of public finance,
competitiveness, and governance and education sectors.

A. Recent Developments




Sri Lanka’s growth slowed in 2016 due to a deceleration of consumption amid inclement weather.

The real sector was     The impact of floods in the month of May and droughts in the second half of 2016
adversely affected by   reduced the year’s economic growth to 4.4 percent compared to 4.8 percent
weather.                recorded in 2015. Adverse weather turned the agriculture sector’s contribution to
                        growth into a negative 0.3 percentage points4 while impacting related industry and
                        service sectors (Box 2). In contrast, the construction sector’s contribution to growth
                        increased to 1.0 percentage point indicating a strong rebound from a negative
                        contribution to growth in the previous year. This was mainly due to resumption of a
                        few large-scale infrastructure projects and increased private construction activities.
                        Nevertheless, the construction rebound was not sufficient to fully compensate for
                        the dampened performance of other industry and service sectors amid unfavorable
                        weather conditions, leading to a lower growth rate for 2016 compared to the
                        previous year (Figure 3).

Consumption and         Contribution to growth from consumption reached a six-year-low at 0.7 percentage
net exports recorded    points with both private and public consumption growing marginally. The increase
subdued                 in interest rates and taxes and the impact of past currency depreciation affecting
performance.            import prices reduced private consumption’s contribution to growth to 0.5
                        percentage points. Meanwhile, on-going fiscal consolidation efforts kept public
                        consumption in check in real terms in 2016, after the 2015 fiscal budget increased
                        public consumption significantly. However, mirroring construction sector growth,
                        gross fixed capital formation made a significant contribution to growth at 6.2
                        percentage points5 while net exports had a negative impact on growth of 2.5
                        percentage points due to increase in imports compared to exports (Figure 4).

Box 2: The impact of recurring natural disasters
Sri Lanka is vulnerable to recurring natural disasters with a significant economic, fiscal and social impact:
      The May 2016 floods and landslides had a total estimated impact of LKR 100 billion. It was
        estimated that the damage was mainly to the private sector (housing, industry and commerce, LKR
        90 billion), while the effect on the public sector was mainly through infrastructure and transport
        sector damage (LKR 8 billion). In the aftermath, the Government drew the USD 102 million
        World Bank’s Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan with a Catastrophe Deferred
        Drawdown Option (Cat-DDO) to provide immediate liquidity. The disaster affected mainly the
        Colombo and Gampaha urban areas, which has a large number of people living in or close to
        poverty.1
      The late 2016 drought’s impact mainly affected the agricultural sector, and led to widespread
        food insecurity in the affected regions. It led to decreased exports of agricultural exports, mainly
        tea, and increased imports of petrol, as hydropower reservoirs ran dry. The impact can also be
        seen on GDP growth, where the negative impact on agriculture dragged down growth.2
      Floods and landslides in late May 2017 have affected districts in the South-West, affected more
        than half a million people and caused 213 deaths and 77 people missing. This disaster destroyed
        over 3000 houses and partially damaged more than 20,000 houses. The economic impact of the
        event is being currently studied.3

On average over the long term, annual losses for housing, infrastructure, agriculture, and relief from
natural disasters are estimated at LKR 50 billion (or around USD 327 million), with the highest annual
expected losses from floods (LKR 32 billion), cyclones or high winds (LKR 11 billion), droughts (LKR 5.2
billion) and landslides (LKR 1.8 billion). This is equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP or 2.1 percent of
government expenditure.4

The execution of the budget is knocked off track continuously due to the impact of natural disasters, which
seem to have increased in frequency, severity and economic impact as Sri Lanka’s economy has grown and
has become more sophisticated. Although fewer people were impacted than in previous floods, the damage
caused by the 2016 floods and landslides was more than twice as high in US dollar terms than the worst
flood disasters between 1992 and 2011.4

It is of utmost importance for Sri Lanka to increase its physical resilience (to reduce impact of disasters)
and financial resilience (to deal with the impact when the disaster happens). To improve physical
resilience, the World Bank is supporting the Government’s Climate Resilience Improvement Project
(CRIP)5 and recommends:
     1. Identify current climate risk, and implement immediate risk mitigation interventions
     2. Identify future drivers of risk
     3. Create basin-level long-term risk mitigation investment plans, followed by physical investments

To improve financial resilience, the World Bank recommends the following options to increase the
Government’s immediate financial response capacity against natural disasters and better protect its fiscal
balance as well as to achieve timely response, relief and recovery:

Short term
    (a) Streamline damage-and-loss data collection and reporting system
    (b) Develop a national disaster risk financing strategy
    (c) Review the sustainability of the current catastrophe insurance program implemented by the
          government Enhance data sharing for insurance market development

Medium to long term
   (d) Develop financial tools to support decision making, including a disaster risk model for Ministry of
        Finance Establish a National Disaster Reserve Fund as fast-disbursement mechanism for the
        financing of post-disaster operations;
   (e) Explore catastrophe risk insurance options for public assets;
   (f) Strengthen the agricultural insurance program

Inflation rose due to weather, VAT changes and demand pressures.
Inflation has been          A combination of factors including crop losses due to adverse weather, past
rising from the             currency depreciation and increased indirect taxes have contributed to a rise in
second half of 2016.        inflation since the second half of 2016 while low inflation levels observed in the year

                            (2013=100) reached 6.0 percent in May 2017 from 4.8 percent recorded a year
                            earlier. Annual average inflation followed suit by rising to 5.4 percent from 2.7
                            during the same period. In addition to food inflation, larger contributions to the rise
                            in prices came from health,6 education restaurant and hotel segments with the
                            increase in VAT rate. Reflecting demand pressures in the economy amid continued

Rationalization of expenditure and improved revenue collection helped meeting fiscal targets.

                        5.4 percent of GDP as against a 7.6 percent reported for 2015 (Table 1, Figure 7).11

The deficit was         Foreign sources provided about 61 percent of net financing, which included
financed mainly         sovereign bonds worth of USD 1.5 billion12 and syndicated loans amounting to
using foreign           USD 700 million raised in external financial markets. The remaining 39 percent was
financing.              financed through domestic sources predominantly by the banking sector, especially
                        by the central bank. This was manifested in the treasury bill stock held by the central
                        bank almost tripling by end-2016 compared the previous year. As in the past,
                        Employees’ Provident Fund, National Savings Bank and other savings and
                        insurance institutions made a significant contribution to the domestic non-bank
                        financing component.

Exchange rate           In spite of fiscal achievements, the central government debt increased by 1.6
depreciation and        percentage points to 79.3 percent of GDP in 2016 due mainly to exchange rate
high interest rates     depreciation and the real interest rate effect (Figure 8). Meanwhile, the debt profile
pushed up central       also indicated significant exposure to a variety of risks. The non-concessional and
government debt         commercial component of the government foreign debt rose from 1 percent in
further.                2000 to 53 percent in 2016. The interest rate risks on foreign currency debt has
                        risen, while average interest rates also increased. The average time to maturity has
                        shortened, while reserve adequacy in relation to share of the foreign-currency
                        commercial debt component has deteriorated. Given the bunching in external
                        Eurobond repayments, external debt service could become a matter of concern
                        starting from 2019. These factors suggest that, in the absence of high growth rates
                        seen in earlier years, fiscal consolidation and more efficient debt management are
                        key to improving debt profile and bringing it back debt to a sustainable path.

The fiscal risk posed   Treasury guarantees primarily granted to SOEs and state agencies to borrow from

guarantees has          although the utilization remained relatively low.13 Moreover, the composition of
increased.              guarantees has been changing over time, with the significance of guarantees given to
                        institutions with stable revenue streams, such as Ceylon Petroleum Corporation
                        (CPC) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), declining from 90 percent in 2006 to 36
                        percent in 2016 while guarantees given to state establishments, primarily dependent
                        on the state budget, are on the rise (Figure 11).14




                        11 The final fiscal deficit was 13 percent lower than the approved deficit estimate.
                        12  During the year, USD 1.5 billion worth of sovereign bonds were issued at yields between 5.75 (5-
                           year) and 6.825 (10-year).
                        13 Issued treasury guarantees increased as a share of GDP from 5.6 percent in 2015 to 7.1 in 2016 while

                           the used guarantees also moved up from 3.7 to 4.4 percent of GDP during the same period.
                        14 Among others, these include Road Development Authority, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence

                           University and Urban Development Authority. These agencies have no significant sources of
                           revenue and the debt repayment will likely come from the Treasury in the future.

                         last quarter. Prolonged drought conditions led to the depletion of hydropower
                         capacity and increased petroleum imports for thermal power generation towards the
                         end of the year. Although strong growth in tourism flows along with stable worker
                         remittances continued to cover the trade deficit, service outflows and interest
                         payments are expected to have led to a current account deficit of 2.4 percent of
                         GDP.

Debt-creating flows      Volatile capital in- and outflows from the government securities market in the wake
dominated the            of rising global interest rates and political developments (Figure 12), external debt
financial account.       service payments and lower than expected FDI inflows15 exerted pressure on the
                         external financial account in 2016. Project financing-related debt flows16 and
                         proceeds from sovereign bonds and the syndicated loans mentioned above
                         remained the key inflows. Reflecting external sector pressures, the end-period
                         exchange rate depreciated by 4.0 percent against a strengthening dollar and 3.2

                         2017 are estimated at USD 7.0 billion, implying that official reserves net of short-
                         term liabilities are negative; nevertheless, about USD 2.3 billion or one third of these
                         liabilities represent swap arrangements with domestic banks (which have issued
                         medium-term international bonds) that may be rolled over.20 The central bank
                         expects that the foreign inflows related to the setting up of Hambantota PPP, the
                         issuance of sovereign bonds21 and purchases of foreign exchange would shore up
                         reserves in the coming months.

                            in May 2017. The coupon rate of 6.20 percent reflected a spread of 380 bps over the US Treasury
                            rate for a 10-year security, which compares well with a 540 bps spread recorded in the previous

The monetary policy was tightened belatedly to curb rapid credit growth and rising core inflation.

Amid high monetary            The central bank increased the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) in January and

bank tightened                curb high private credit growth and rising inflation. Notwithstanding the resultant
policy in 2016 and            overall increase in market interest rates,22 private credit granted by the banking
2017.                         sector recorded a 21.9 percent year-on-year growth on account of the expansion of
                              loan book in the trade, financial and other personal service categories and
                              construction, consistent with the large contribution to gross fixed capital formation
                              to GDP growth in 2016.23 The central bank increased the policy rates by 25 basis
                              points in March 2017 as a precautionary measure to check inflationary pressures.
                              Mirroring the high credit growth, reserve money also grew rapidly with increased
                              central bank financing to the government to reach a record high annual average
                              growth rate of 25 percent for the year 2016 while broad money (M2b) posted a
                              growth of 18 percent (Figure 14). Despite high growth in monetary aggregates,
                              market experienced occasional liquidity shortages, pushing up interest rates.




                              22 Driven mainly by policy rate tightening, average weighted prime lending rate increased by about 400

                              23 The sluggish response of private credit growth to policy tightening at least in part reflects the lags in

                                 monetary policy transmission.

Listed equity returns were subdued due to political uncertainty and decelerating net foreign

Listed equity market            Rising domestic interest rates shifting capital to fixed income securities weighed on

performance.                    Index (ASPI) declined for a second consecutive year by 9.7 percent in 2016
                                following a 5.5 percent decline in 2015. Market capitalization also declined as a
                                share of GDP reflecting the trend of overall index performance.24 Although
                                dividend yield increased thanks to the decrease in stock prices, Price-Earnings ratio
                                (PER) decreased by about 30 percent during the year 2016. However, some limited
                                upward momentum of the indices was observed in the first quarter of 2017.

The banking sector              The banking sector remained well capitalized and adequately liquid. The regulatory
continued to remain             Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) requirement under Basel II was maintained well
stable.                         above the required level of 10 percent and the Statutory Liquid Asset Ratio was also
                                maintained well above the minimum statutory requirement of 20 percent during the
                                year 2016. The expansion of the loan book was supported by the growth in deposits
                                in a high interest environment. Faster growth in lending rates compared to deposit
                                rates led to increased net interest income resulting improved Return on Assets
                                (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) for the banking sector. Non-Performing Loan

                                growth and aggressive credit recovery. However, NPL ratio could be elevated in
                                2017 when the pace of credit growth decelerates following two years of rapid credit
                                growth. Moreover, increasing leverage, shown by the strong increase in credit
                                relative to the size of the sector, such as construction, tourism and financial
                                business, warrants attention (Figure 13). Although the sector remains well-
                                capitalized, implementation of Basel III will require the banks to strive hard to
                                increase the capital base.

Despite the fast poverty reduction, there remain areas with significant poverty; a large share of the
population subsists on little more than the extreme poverty line.

Extreme poverty is      Despite the recent macroeconomic challenges, extreme poverty remains low, as the
low in Sri Lanka and    $1.90 (PPP 2011) poverty rate fell half a percentage point, from 2.4 to 1.9 percent
fell slightly further   between 2009/10 and 2012/13. The real per capita consumption of the bottom 40
between 2009/10 and     percent increased 2.2 percent annually between 2006/07 and 2012/13, and
2012/13.                improved living standards is reflected in rising asset ownership, declining shares of
                        food consumption, and a rise in reported household per capita income among the
                        poor. A new poverty estimates for Q1 2016 is expected to be released in May, 2017.

During the past year, Employment in agriculture continues to fall, boosting productivity and contributing
labor market trends   to continued declines in poverty. Between 2013 and 2016, the share of employment
have been mixed.      in agriculture fell from 30.2 to 27.1 percent. Unemployment remained constant
                      during that period, at a manageable 4.4 percent. Furthermore, perhaps due to the
                      shift out of agriculture, the share of workers 40 hours or more increased from 65.5
                      to 67.9 percent of the workforce. Female labor force participation remains low and
                      lags male rates by nearly 40 percentage points.

A large share of the    Moderate poverty remains high. In 2012/13, nearly 15 percent of the population,
population subsists     and a quarter of the Estate sector, lived on less than $3.10 per day. Furthermore,
on little more than     pockets of poverty persist in the North, East, Estate Sector and Moneragala district
the extreme poverty     where equality of opportunities in terms of access to services and linkages to the
line.                   labor market are weaker. Spending on social assistance declined in real terms
                        between 2004 and 2014, and suffers from inefficient targeting. The decline in social
                        assistance comes as consumption growth became markedly less pro-poor between
                        2009/10 and 2012/13, causing the Gini coefficient of inequality to rise sharply from
                        0.363 in 2009/10 to 0.389 in 2012/13. Other challenges also remain, including high
                        rates of malnutrition, low rates of female labor force participation, and a rapidly
                        aging population.25

insecurity.             percent) than the national average (6.7 percent). However, their high population

A relatively favorable   The continuation of the IMF program will add to the confidence while helping

in the backdrop of       has already undertaken to implement an ambitious medium-term reform agenda
policy reforms.          aimed at improving competitiveness, governance and public financial management
                         that would bring in long-term benefits. Monetary policy has shown that it stands
                         ready to take appropriate action in the direction of stability. This is supported by a
                         strengthening global growth outlook, including in some countries important to Sri
                         Lanka (Box 3). These developments have contributed to an improved outlook.

Growth is expected       Growth is expected to reach 4.7 percent in 201729 and grow marginally over 5.0
to pick up with          percent beyond, driven by private consumption and investment growth. Although
manageable               the short to medium term growth will continue to be driven by non-tradable
inflation.               sectors, successful implementation of reforms should help the country to rely on
                         productive tradable sectors in the long run. Inflation will pick up towards upper
                         single digit level in the first half of 2017 because of past high monetary growth
                         along with the increase of VAT collection. However, the base-effect will see
                         inflation stabilizing around mid-single digit level towards the end of 2017. Low
                         international commodity prices, though gradually increasing, will help maintain the
                         downward pressure. In the medium term, the announced shift by the central bank
                         to flexible inflation targeting will keep inflation in the single digits, while the
                         exchange rate is left to adjust to market forces.

Fiscal consolidation     The fiscal deficit is projected to fall to 5.2 percent of GDP for 2017. This is thanks

                              with improved tax administration will help increase revenues. On the expenditure

                              assuming no major additional recurrent expenditure commitments. Under this

                              fiscal balance is projected to become marginally positive in 2017.

Public debt levels are        This continued fiscal consolidation is projected to bring the public debt burden on a
projected to fall,            downward path again. Fiscal discipline is even more important in an environment of
provided fiscal               rising domestic interest rates, an expected gradual tightening of global financial
consolidation                 conditions and an expected gradual depreciation of the exchange rate, as the central
remains on track.             bank moves to inflation targeting. Under the baseline scenario, this would return the
                              debt-to-GDP ratio to 72 percent of GDP by 2020. However, this is subject to
                              shocks. A shock to the growth rate or exchange rate would widen the fiscal deficit
                              (Figure 15) and would mainly affect the path of public debt (Figure 16).30 In
                              addition, there is a risk that guarantees and other contingent liabilities are called.

Box 3: Global economic context
Growth and prices: Global growth is firming, contributing to an improvement in confidence. A recovery
in industrial activity has coincided with a pick-up in global trade, after two years of marked weakness. In
emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), obstacles to growth among commodity exporters
are gradually diminishing, while activity in commodity importers remains generally robust. As a result, and
despite substantial policy uncertainty, global growth is projected to accelerate to 2.7 percent in 2017, up
from a post-crisis low of 2.4 percent in 2016, before strengthening further to 2.9 percent in 2018-19 (Table
3.1). Commodity prices have continued to rise moderately, although prospects for increased U.S. shale oil
production are weighing on the outlook for oil prices.
Financial markets: Global financing conditions have been benign and benefited from improving market
expectations about growth prospects. Financial market volatility has been low despite elevated policy
uncertainty, reflecting investor risk appetite and, perhaps, some level of market complacency. Renewed risk
appetite has supported EMDE financial markets and led to a narrowing of corporate bond spreads
globally. Capital inflows to EMDEs were robust in the first half of 2017, partly in a rebound from late-
2016 weakness. Over time, however, a gradual tightening of international financing conditions may weigh
on capital flows to EMDEs.
Risks: Substantial risks cloud this outlook, despite the possibility of fiscal stimulus in some major
advanced economies, particularly the United States. Escalating trade restrictions could derail a fragile
recovery in trade and undo gains from past liberalization efforts. A further increase in policy uncertainty
from already high levels could dampen confidence and investment and trigger financial market stress, after
a period of unusually low financial market volatility. Market reassessment of advanced-economy monetary
policy, or disorderly exchange rate developments, could contribute to swings in EMDE asset prices and
capital flows, potentially amplified by vulnerabilities in some countries. Over the longer term, persistent
weakness in productivity and investment growth would erode potential growth.
Factors affecting EMDE growth prospects: Even if the expected modest rebound in investment across
EMDEs materializes, slowing capital accumulation in recent years may already have reduced potential
growth. Moreover, structural headwinds to global trade, worsening demographics, slowing productivity
growth, and governance and institutional challenges could adversely affect EMDE growth.
South Asia: Growth in the region is forecast to pick up to 6.8 percent in 2017 and accelerate to 7.1
percent in 2018, reflecting a solid expansion of domestic demand and exports. Excluding India, regional
growth is anticipated to hold steady at 5.7 percent, rising to 5.8 percent, with growth accelerating in
Bhutan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka but easing in Bangladesh and Nepal. India is expected to accelerate to 7.2
percent in fiscal 2017 and 7.5 percent in next fiscal year. Pakistan is expected to pick up to a 5.2 percent

                               portfolio and official financing (Table 3). Faster than expected rises in commodity
                               prices would increase pressure on the balance of payments and make domestic fuel
                               and electricity price reforms more difficult. On the fiscal side, risks include the delay
                               in passing structural revenue measures and slower than expected improvement in
                               tax administration. Tightening global financial conditions would increase the cost of
                               debt and would make rolling over the maturing Eurobonds from 2019 more
                               difficult. Finally, the increasing occurrence and impact of natural disasters could
                               have an adverse impact on growth, the fiscal consolidation path, the trade balance
                               and poverty reduction.

and equitable            coordinated approach. Adopting a piece-meal solution to address the challenges is

                         advancing the reform agenda. Steps are needed to ensure the support of private
                         sector, civil society and other stakeholders through improved communications on
                         costs and benefits of the reform agenda.

                         but may require the public sector to assume more fiscal risk. In this context, the
                         Government has taken steps to set up a unified Debt Management Office (DMO),
                         but progress has been slow since then. A proactive debt management strategy can

                        sustain growth in the medium term with an aging population. A reduced fiscal
                        deficit will also limit exposure to global financial markets, which have become more
                        volatile recently and which are expected to gradually become tighter, and to free up
                        credit for the private sector in the domestic market. A reduced fiscal deficit, a
                        reduced debt level and more predictability in the markets will also reduce the burden
                        on the central bank to provide temporary financing, which gives it more operational
                        independence to pursue an appropriate monetary and exchange rate policy for the
                        country.

                        expensive tax holidays, exemptions and special rates. Although there is room for
                        improvement through sector targeting, investment allowance based incentives could
                        be helpful for simplification and reduce leakages while preserving competitiveness.

consideration.          example, it appears that little of the direct benefits of many current VAT
                        exemptions accrue to the poor. In fact, virtually all tax exemptions are less efficient
                        in helping poor, since wealthier households account for the majority of
                        consumption on almost all specific items. However, removing them does come at
                        the cost to the poor. Replacing them by targeted expenditure under the social safety
                        net could be a more efficient way to protect the poor at a lower fiscal cost, while
                        simplifying the VAT system. Ongoing efforts to reform the targeting system used
                        by the flagship Samurdhi Social Protection program will help in this regard. The
                        increased fiscal space could be used for investment in public health and education
                        provision and infrastructure to benefit poor areas.

                  1. Special Focus: Unleashing Sri Lanka’s Trade Potential
Box 4: Policy recommendations to improve trade and business environment and FDI
This section contains a number of policy recommendations, which are summarized here:
     Trade policy: (1) adopt trade policy with a gradual but firm liberalization schedule, allowing time
        for adjustment to avoid a sudden shock to fiscal revenue and the balance of payment; and (2)
        make progress on bilateral trade agreements while carefully evaluating the costs and benefits to Sri
        Lanka, with a particular focus on non-tariff barriers and Mutual Recognition Agreements.
     Trade facilitation: (1) adopt a systematic and effective risk management system, the absence of
        which imposes a huge burden in terms of time and cost, adversely impacting competitiveness; and
        (2) create a single trade information portal will help meet the informational needs of businesses.
     Innovation: improve the innovation landscape in Sri Lanka especially for SMEs and start-ups.
     FDI attraction: (1) enhance effectiveness of the Board of Investment as a ‘one-stop shop’ for
        foreign investors; (2) strengthen BOI’s investment attraction capabilities by adopting modern tools
        and techniques in sector targeting, investor outreach, and investor facilitation; (3) strengthen
        investment retention capacity through ‘after sales services’ for existing investors; and (4) address
        regulatory barriers to FDI in backbone sectors to promote exports.
     Ensure coherence and coordination between investment policy and trade policy with a clear
        indication of future policy direction.
     Conduct awareness campaigns and adopt an effective communication strategy to dispel concerns
        regarding PTAs.
     Enhance institutional capacity of GoSL to address the shortcomings in the investment climate
        undermining the competitiveness of the private sector.
     Formulate a legal framework and policies to help firms and workers adjust to the impact of trade
        policy reforms and allow them to seize new opportunities.

                         gradual but firm liberalization schedule, allowing time for adjustment, with a fixed
                         phase-out schedule (sunset). It is clear that para-tariffs need to be consolidated,
                         reduced in magnitude, and eventually eliminated, as they are non-transparent in
                         nature and their ad-hoc imposition as an easy “go-to? for revenue generation takes
                         away predictability, which is critical for production and investment decisions.
                         Similarly, export taxes on agricultural commodities need to be revisited as the
                         rationale behind them is no longer clear. Policy simulations suggest that the
                         expected increase in economic activity and trade, and other ongoing tax revenue
                         reforms will offset the possible losses from reducing the tariff and para-tariff rates.

                         for trade facilitation, widespread awareness campaigns are vital for information

Box 5: Impact of mega-regional trade agreements on South Asia and Sri Lanka
Recent global political developments suggest that for many people in advanced economies globalization
has gone too far. Political events in the UK and the US have been interpreted as signaling a shift against
the international trade architecture including mega-regional trade agreements. However, it is noted that
recently stalled mega-regional trade agreements, which did not include any South Asian country, were
expected to reduce South Asia’s competitiveness. In fact, simulations on the impact of hypothetical new
trade barriers applied across the board suggest that the harm for the region would be limited; while a
scenario where hypothetical new trade barriers would be applied selectively, South Asia could actually
benefit from trade diversion. Sri Lanka also stands to gain from the observed growth recovery in advanced
economies, because they are the main markets for its exports. The gains would be larger if its exports were
more diversified and its supply response were more elastic. The current globalization backlash should thus
not dissuade South Asian countries including Sri Lanka from having a stronger outward orientation.

The recently published World Bank South Asia Economic Focus looks at the impact of recent trade-related
global developments on the South Asia region. The full report is available online at:

of the private sector.   High transaction cost associated in complying with unnecessarily burdensome
                         regulations which undermine entrepreneurship is a factor contributing to the high
                         level of informality prevalent in the country. In turn, unfair competition from
                         informal businesses is one of the main obstacles that has stunted the growth of Sri
                         Lanka’s formal sector, which in turn has been a drag on firm productivity.

                         According to the 2017 survey results, Sri Lanka ranks 110 out of 190 economies in

                         Lanka(GoSL) announced the Government’s intention to improve Sri Lanka’s
                         investment climate and reach a top 70 ranking on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing
                         Business Index by 2020.

                         GoSL needs to recognize that its policies and behaviors play a critical role in
                         shaping the investment climate in Sri Lanka. In this context, a well-defined

                         forward.
                         It is clear that investment reform is a cornerstone of meaningful and long-term
                         growth; it attracts investment that generates employment opportunities, provides
                         access to knowledge capital, and plays a significant role in formalizing the informal
                         sector in Sri Lanka’s economy.

                        economy. Firms and exporters will gain access to world-class inputs at competitive
                        prices, and thus be able to breach new markets. Since trade and investment
                        complement each other, trade liberalization will also bring FDI, which, in turn, will
                        bring skills, technology, and foreign capital as well as access to GVCs and new

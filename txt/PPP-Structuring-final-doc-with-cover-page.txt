Introduction




1. Introduction
1.1. Background
There has been substantial capacity addition over the last six decades and yet, demand has constantly been
outstripping supply. This can be attributed to the energy and peak shortages caused by the rapid economic
growth, urbanisation and a growing population. As per CEA estimates, diesel-based captive generation which
constitutes 20% of the present grid connected capacity bridges the deficit. In addition to peak shortage, the
electricity spread is an equally serious issue. About 40% of the population has little or no access to commercial
energy , while with the rest face insufficient and erratic power supply coupled with an increasing amount
unscheduled load shedding.

Despite low per capita GHG emissions, by virtue of its size and accelerating growth rates, India will majorly
influence global energy investments and carbon trajectories. Census 2011 reveals that 93% of the urban
population uses electricity for lighting. This population being relatively economically well off, even has access to
diesel-based generator sets as a back-up solution to the irregular grid based power supply. However, a majority
of the rural population still depends on kerosene for their lighting requirements. This greatly hampers
productivity and limits their scope of work, ultimately crippling overall development.

In summary, while India has a total power supply installed capacity of around 250 GW, only around 135 GW of
this actually caters to the demand due to a range of issues whether lack of fuel, stranded assets, inefficient old
assets, etc. Given that per capita power consumption in India is only at around 950 kilo watt-hour (kWh), and
would need to increase to global levels (China at 4000 kWh; western nations at 15,000 kWh), the actual
demand supply deficit in India is likely to be much higher than the current 4% peak electricity shortage. The
Planning Commission’s Working Group for the 12th Plan estimated a total fund requirement for the power
sector alone in the 2012-2017 period, to be around Rs 14 lakh crores. Further, given the major impact of a
growing power sector on the environment, there is a major need for a growth in renewable energy sources and
the Planning Commission estimated investments required (within the total fund requirement above) of Rs
135,100 crores for renewable energy (RE) sources. Finally, given the scale of investments needed, the
requirement for private sector to participate in a major way in development of such projects through modalities
such as public private partnerships (PPPs) becomes critical so as to better leverage funds and efficiencies

1.2. Purpose of the Study
While various initiatives such as RGGVY, aimed at expanding grid connectivity are underway, the actual supply
still remains highly unpredictable and limited. In remote areas with a low population density, off-grid energy
solutions seem most practical and economical. However, most off-grid solutions, due to their size will need to
drive energy from renewable sources such as biomass, solar, hydro or wind. There is also an element of
uncertainty attached to such off-grid solutions as once there is grid penetration in the area; consumers are
likely to procure the same power at a lower rate.

Given the above backdrop, the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance (DEA) has been
supporting the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in developing possible models and pilot
projects in the RE space utilizing the PPP modality, which can thus provide PPP models for replication in the
sector and thus help achieve the RE capacity development as envisaged.

This analysis has thus been undertaken with this objective, first to briefly analyse the current RE sector and the
learnings from RE schemes and projects underway, and then to develop a possible PPP model or pilot project
structure for a critical area within the RE sector, which would mitigate challenges being seen at present in any
part of the RE arena. The model developed would especially highlight key support required from the
Introduction




Government to make PPPs an attractive and bankable proposition. The model could then be tested through a
pilot project to be developed by the relevant state or central government authorities.

As per our initial analysis, development of affordable, accessible, and reliable energy supply in rural areas is one
of India’s biggest challenges. Despite a series of ambitious programmes such as the RGGVY which solely focus
on rural electrification, most PPP investments still tend to be largely limited to the urban consumer bases with a
better commercial bankability rationale. The actual impact of past government rural electrification programmes
has also been challenged by several aspects such as the definition of the term electrified or providing sufficient
incentives for PPP investments in rural areas. It has been noted in some studies that the actual per capita
consumption in villages in heavily electrified states such as Madhya Pradesh may indeed have gone down
despite the advancements in infrastructure.

While over 93% of urban India uses electricity as its primary source for lighting, only 55% of rural India does
the same leaving the remaining 45% dependent on other sources or with no access to any source at all. Over
25,000 villages are reportedly considered ‘un-electrified’; the actual numbers however, are much higher if
supply patterns are used as a criteria rather than the infrastructural development.

Rural electrification has thus been identified as a key impact area where an RE model undertaken under a PPP
modality and supported by adequate government funds, can lead to measureable, affordable and reliable
increases in electricity supply to the rural population; paving the way for inclusive development of the country.

1.3. Electrification scenario at rural and urban level
1.3.1. Rural Electrification Status
The Indian government considers rural electrification to be the prime mover for rural development. It is also
the basic pre-requisite for all industrial activity and also contributes significantly towards increasing
agricultural productivity, jobs and income generation activities. Several programmes have been initiated at the
national level to promote electrification of remote villages and BPL households through the deployment of
various renewable energy technologies that include family biogas plants, solar street lights, solar lanterns, solar
PV systems, biomass gasifiers and micro-hydro plants. Several programmes and policies focused on
development of rural energy, economy, and electrification to improve rural livelihood with the help of
renewable energy have also been initiated. However, inspite of all said interventions, the real numbers are not
too convincing.

1.3.2. Urban Electrification status
Currently, 93% urban households use electricity for lighting. Energy access in the urban areas has attained a
satisfactory level but peak power shortage mandates the employment of prudent grid management approaches.

Further, due to wide disparity in electricity usage across households in urban and rural areas, it is important to
improve energy access in the far flung rural zones. In addition, the hamlets or other small settlements that
surround villages which have been electrified under the RGGVY have no access to grid electricity. This calls for
immediate contemplation regarding innovative approaches that can provide energy access in such areas. In
order to meet the energy requirement, it is necessary to understand the appropriate size of applications that can
be entrusted with the task of providing power.
Introduction




1.4. Benefits of small scale projects over centralized
    applications for Rural Electrification
Grid coverage in rural areas has considerably increased recently. However, the non-availability of power in
these grids has created a huge demand deficit resulting in severe power shortages. Power availability in grids
can be increased by inserting grid interaction generating assets. These can either be large megawatt plants or
small clustered assets and can assist in meeting the local load requirement.

The larger ones have a higher gestation period. Identifying an appropriate site and seeking the rights for the
site, environmental clearances and power transmissions are among the many challenges in this process.
Moreover, fuel supply for such plants another major impediment.

Small scale projects with reasonable capacity have an edge over such centralised plants. These can be connected
to the grid connected at various points and can energise the grid at the distinct load center. Site identification
and subsequently securing relevant clearances may not be an issue in rural areas. Also, they have a
comparatively low gestation period. Extremely small plants are not economically viable but if they are
reasonably sized and can supply power to a group of villages and hamlets, they are likely to be more sustainable.
This can also help in utilising the local talent, generating more economic activity in the process.

1.5. Renewable based decentralized application for Rural
     Electrification
Renewable technologies have substantial potential to provide a reliable and secure energy supply as an
alternative to grid extensions or as a supplement to grid power and are therefore suitable for electrification of
rural areas, especially the remote ones that still lack access to modern energy sources like electricity. In India,
locally available, renewable energy sources can go a long way in alleviating the electricity deficit and can play a
prominent role in enhancing energy access. Also, with the increasing thrust that the government is placing on
power from renewable energies, it will be prudent to employ renewable power in developing decentralised
generation assets to plug the rural energy deficit. The government has also promulgated various schemes to this
effect. The JNNSM, for example, encourages the employment of decentralised applications that are solar-based.

Typically, the kilowatt scale of generation assets based on renewable energy has been developed in the
decentralised mode to power villages across certain states. Organisations such as SARAN Power and HUSK
Power have installed biomass-based decentralised gasifier generation sets ranging from 30 to 40Kw. This has
been done across villages in Bihar, following the cluster approach. Even the flagship initiative of the
government of India to electrify villages not covered under RGVVY, typically range in a few kilowatts. The list of
such DDG projects has been provided in the annexure.

Currently operating decentralised plants are facing their own set of challenges. These projects are rendered
redundant once the grid penetrates as the same power supply then becomes available at cheaper rates.
However, grid penetration does not guarantee round the clock power availability. This makes it imperative to
design a plan wherein grid connected kilowatt scale generation assets with a cluster approach can be created in
order to electrify as well as power the rural households.

1.6. Project Structuring of the Rural Electrification
    Projects- Case for PPP structuring
Considering the fact that small scale renewable projects connected to the grid may prove to be a cornerstone in
rural electrification, it is essential to create a suitable framework under which these projects can be developed.
It is also important to understand that the development of such projects under a government ownership model
will invariably become a difficult proposition. This is because the government will not only be responsible for
the identification of suitable sites and provide necessary clearances, but will also have to create the necessary
Introduction




apparatus for project aggregation, implementation as well as development. This, apart from making the process
extremely complex, will make the monitoring of all these projects rather difficult.

In a PPP on the other hand, the responsibility of the government is only to identify the site, secure clearances
and procure power from generation assets. The private sector will have to employ its expertise in developing
renewable assets as well as contribute towards the overall implementation of the project. It is advisable for
small scale renewable energy based grid connected projects to be established under PPPs which will then sell
the power to local distribution utilities at retail tariffs. Government support through viability gap funding shall
also be provided to ensure its bankability. Certain such solar power projects at the rural level have already been
proposed.

1.7. Structure of the report
In order to achieve the aforementioned objective, a sound understanding of the policy regime which is currently
being pursued to develop solar and wind projects in the country is essential. Additionally, it is important to
comprehend the rural electrification status as well as the surrounding policies aimed at promoting rural
electrification initiatives. Gauging the existing structure of private participation will provide useful insight into
how the level of engagement in solar and wind related PPP models can be increased.

2.1.1. Overview of current status of electricity demand and supply
       in India
Despite increase in installed capacity by more than 110 times in 62 years, India is still not in a position to meet
its peak demand as well as energy requirement. The peak power deficit during FY 2001-02 was 12.2%
approximately 9252 MW, however, at the end of FY 2013-14, the peak power deficit decreased to the order of
4.5% and in absolute terms peak deficit clocked at 6103 MW. The figure below presents the status of peak
power required vis-à-vis peak power met during the various periods.

Similarly, the shortage in terms of energy availability was around 7.5% at the end of FY 2001-02 (39,187 MU)
whereas at the end of FY 2011-12 it reduced to around 4.2%. However, in absolute terms it increased to
42,428MU. As fallout of this situation, the planned and un-planned load shedding measures were required to
be undertaken by most of the Utilities to bridge this demand-supply gap. The figure below presents status of the
year-wise variation of energy requirement and its availability-

India’s energy usage has been rapidly increasing as a result of economic growth in the last decade; however
India still has one of the lowest per capita consumptions of energy and electricity in the world and many states
face an acute power shortage. Also, the growing energy supply deficit can be further verified and collaborated
with the fact that India has a low per capital energy consumption vis-à-vis China and other Western countries

It may be noted that shortage in both capacity (i.e., MW terms) as well as energy (i.e., in MU terms) is showing
ascending trend. The increasing power shortage may be attributed to the following factors:

         Inadequate generation capacity addition
         Poor financial position of the distribution utilities
         High distribution losses
         Transmission capacity constraint

Therefore, there is a growing emphasis to bridge the demand supply gap by supplementing the conventional
energy sources with alternate non-conventional energy sources as well as to decrease the carbon footprint in
energy intensive Indian economy by providing thrust on implementation of alternate energy sources. Next
section highlights major policy initiatives undertaken by the Government of India for promotion of renewable
energy in India.

2.2. Major renewable energy policies and regulation in
    India
2.2.1. Electricity Act 2003 (EA 2003)
The Electricity Act 2003 (EA 2003) has radically changed the legal and regulatory framework concerning the
RE sector. EA 2003 was passed by both houses of the Parliament and made effective from 10 June 2003,
making it the single most important piece of legislation for the sector and effectively nullifying all earlier
enactments. EA 2003 provides for policy formulation by the Indian government and mandates SERCs to take
steps for promoting renewable and non-conventional sources of energy within their area of jurisdiction.
Further, it has explicitly stated the formulation of National Electricity Policy (NEP), the National Tariff Policy
(NTP) and the plan thereof for development of power systems in order to ensure optimal utilisation of all
resources including the renewable ones.
Extract from relevant sections of the EA 2003

Section 3        The central government shall, from time to time, prepare the NEP and NTP, in
                 consultation with the state governments and the authority for development of the power
                 system based on optimal utilisation of resources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear
                 substances or materials, hydro and renewable sources of energy.
Section 4        The central government shall, after consultation with the state governments, prepare and
                 notify a national policy, permitting stand alone systems (including those based on
                 renewable sources of energy and non-conventional sources of energy) for rural areas.
Section          The appropriate commission shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, specify the terms
61(h)            and conditions for the determination of tariff, and in doing so, shall be guided by the
                 following, namely:
                 …
                 (h) the promotion of co-generation and generation of electricity from renewable sources of
                 energy;
                 …
Section          The state commission shall discharge following functions, namely:
86(1)(e)         …
                 (e) promote co-generation and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy
                 by providing suitable measures for connectivity with grid and sale of electricity to any
                 person, and also specify, for purchase of electricity from such sources, a percentage of total
                 consumption of electricity in the area of distribution licensee
                 …

2.2.2. National Electricity Policy 2005
Significant regulatory developments have taken place since the notification of the NEP 2005 by the central
government. Its various provisions reinforce the need for harnessing RE generation.
NEP 2005 provisions

5.2.20          Feasible potential of non-conventional energy resources, mainly small hydro, wind and bio-
                mass would also need to be exploited fully to create additional power generation capacity.
                With a view to increase the overall share of nonconventional energy sources in the
                electricity mix, efforts will be made to encourage private sector participation through
                suitable promotional measures.
5.12.1          Non-conventional sources of energy being the most environment friendly, there is an urgent
                need to promote generation of electricity based on such sources of energy. For this purpose,
                efforts need to be made to reduce the capital cost of projects based on nonconventional and
                renewable sources of energy. Cost of energy can also be reduced by promoting competition
                within such projects. At the same time, adequate promotional measures would also have to
                be taken for development of technologies and a sustained growth of these sources.
5.12.2          The Electricity Act 2003 provides that co-generation and generation of electricity from non-
                conventional sources would be promoted by the SERCs by providing suitable measures for
                connectivity with grid and sale of electricity to any person and also by specifying, for
                purchase of electricity from such sources, a percentage of the total consumption of
                electricity in the area of a distribution licensee. Such percentage for purchase of power from
                non-conventional sources should be made applicable for the tariffs to be determined by the
                SERCs at the earliest. Progressively, the share of electricity from non-conventional sources
                would need to be increased as prescribed by SERCs. Such purchase by distribution
                companies shall be through competitive bidding process. Considering the fact that it will
                take some time before nonconventional technologies compete in terms of cost with
                conventional sources, the commission may determine an appropriate differential in prices
                to promote these technologies.



2.2.3. National Tariff Policy, 2006
As per the NTP 2006, it will take some time before the non-conventional technologies can compete with
conventional sources in terms of electricity cost. Therefore, procurement by the distribution companies can be
done at preferential tariffs determined by the appropriate state commission.
NTP 2006 provisions

6.4 (1)           the appropriate commission shall fix a minimum percentage for purchase of energy from
                 such sources taking into account availability of such resources in the region and its impact
                 on retail tariffs....

6.4 (2)          .... such procurement by distribution licensees for future requirement shall be done as far
                 as possible through competitive bidding process under section 63 of the Act within the
                 suppliers offering energy from same type of non conventional sources.


2.2.4. National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC)
The NAPCC, announced by the prime minister of India on 30 June 2008, envisages several measures to address
global warming. One of the important measures identified involves increasing the share of RE in total electricity
consumption. It has set a target of 5% RE purchase for FY 2009-10, with an increase of 1% in target each year
for the next 10 years.
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




NAPCC provisions

4.2.2            The EA 2003 and the NTP 2006 provide for both the Central Electricity Regulatory
                 Commission (CERC) and the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) to prescribe
                 a certain percentage of total power purchase by the grid from renewable based sources. It
                 also prescribes that a preferential tariff may be followed for renewables based power.
                 A dynamic minimum renewable purchase standard (DMRPS) may be set, with escalation
                 each year till a pre-defined level is reached, at which time the requirements may be
                 revisited. It is suggested that starting 2009-10, the national renewables standard
                 (excluding hydropower with storage capacity in excess of daily peaking capacity, or based
                 on agriculture based renewables sources that are used for human food) may be set at 5% of
                 total grids purchase, to increase by 1% each year for 10 years. SERCs may set at higher
                 percentages than this minimum at each point in time.


2.2.5. Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Mechanism
The existing legal framework under EA 2003 makes the SERCs for promotion of renewable energy. As a result,
the SERCs set targets for distribution companies to purchase a certain percentage of their total power
requirement known as Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) from renewable energy sources. Scheduling
requirements and prohibitive long-term open access charges, however, pose major barriers for the RE abundant
states to undertake any inter-state sale of their surplus to states that do not have sufficient RE-based power.
Consequently, states with lower RE potential have to maintain a low RPO target. In addition, unit cost of the RE
based non-firm power is higher than the conventional power sources.

As a result, while the RE abundant states have no motivation to produce more than what is required to satisfy
their RPO mandate, states with lesser RE resources are unable to procure any from others. A mechanism that
will recognise and enable inter-state RE transactions is the need of the hour.

The REC mechanism seeks to address this mismatch. So far, the inter-state exchange of renewable energy has
been constrained as all such transactions are governed by inter-state open access regulations and the regional
energy accounting framework, which necessitates scheduling of power. Some RE sources such as biomass or
bagasse based co-generation can be scheduled and inter-state open access transactions based on such firm RE
sources have taken place in the past. However, the inter-state exchange of power based on non-firm RE sources
such as wind energy, solar power, small hydro power, etc, has been constrained. Besides, the cost of open access
wheeling under a long-term arrangement was prohibitive for such non-firm RE sources due to their inherent
lower capacity utilization. The REC mechanism addresses these constraints as the certificate is issued for
energy generated at the point of injection into the grid. It is envisaged that it shall facilitate the emergence of a
large number of cross-border RE transactions based on non-firm RE sources, while at the same time, enhancing
the volume of cross-border RE transactions based on firm RE sources as well.

2.2.6. FOR policies on renewable energy
The Forum of Regulators (FOR) constituted under section 166 of EA 2003, for harmonising the policies across
the regulatory commissions, has published a report titles ‘Policies on Renewables’ with the objective of evolving
a common approach to the promotion of renewable sources of energy in the country as a whole.

Excerpts from FOR renewable energy policies

            Each state commission may specify a minimum RPO of 5% in line with the NAPCC. RPO should be
             calibrated with regard to the energy input in the system, after adjustment of losses and not on
             energy billed.

            Need for a facilitative framework for grid connectivity and inter-state exchange of power generated
             from RE sources.
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




            Need to develop Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) mechanism for achieving the RPO targets.

            Preferential tariff for renewable sources should be specified at least during their loan tenure,
             subsequent to which, they should be encouraged to compete amongst themselves.

            Generation based incentive (GBI) should be declared upfront to enable the regulatory commission
             to factor it in the tariff determination process.

            Each state commission may specify a minimum RPO of 5% in line with the NAPCC. RPO should be
             calibrated with regard to the energy input in the system, after adjustment of losses and not on
             energy billed.



2.3. Wind power in India
2.3.1. Wind power development in India
The growth of wind power sector in India can be grouped into three phases of development:

        Period before 1994-95
        Era between 1995 and 2003 (With Central Government policy support and prior to EA 2003)
        Period after 2003 (Post enactment of Electricity Act 2003)
2.3.1.1. Period before 1994-95
This period can be described as the passive period in the Indian power sector. The control of the entire sector
was in the hands of public sector. During this period, the focus of the government was to make electricity
available for all but without private sector involvement, the sector remains dormant. The demand-supply gap
rose, losses in the sector were considerably high and the sector was becoming increasing unviable for public
utilities to operate. Renewable energy investments were considerably low during the period as the country. At
that time, the renewable energy sector was not aligned with global environment concerns.

There was huge pressure on government budget to increase investment in power sector. It was during this
period, that the country was moving from a closed to open (market based) economy and paradigm shift led to
opening up of power sector to accelerate investments and development in the sector.

2.3.1.2. Period between 1994-95 and 2003 (With Central Government policy
        support and prior to EA 2003)
During this period, the renewable energy sector in general and the wind power sector in particular, registered
significant growth in terms of capacity addition. The installed capacity of wind generation increased from 115
MW at the beginning of FY 1994-95 to 1,868 MW at the end of FY 2002-03.

During this phase, significant wind capacity addition took place in the State of Tamil Nadu, which had more
than 50% share (990 MW) in the total installed capacity of 1,868 MW, at the end of FY 2002-03. Most of the
wind turbines installed during this phase were of 225-500 KW capacity configuration and it was during this
growth phase that the manufacturing of wind turbines also started in India. Many multi-national players
including Vestas, NEG, and Enercon set up their manufacturing facilities in collaboration with local
manufacturers. This era also saw the birth of the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturing company, viz.,
Suzlon Energy Limited.

The growth during this phase was driven by the policy support provided by the central and state governments.
The Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy (re-christened as MNRE in 2006) of central government provided
various fiscal and financial incentives, viz., capital subsidy, tax holiday, buy-back rate, concessional
wheeling & banking charges, and accelerated depreciation.
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




The State Governments also encouraged wind capacity addition programs by providing support in the form of
concessional land allotment, electricity duty exemption and schemes for exemption or deferment of sales tax for
the industry. The wind resource development and R&D programs by Centre for Wind Energy Technology (C-
WET) laid down the foundation for growth of wind sector in the future years.

2.3.1.3. Period after 2003 (Post enactment of Electricity Act 2003)
This phase can be termed as golden phase in the history of wind sector. During the past 9 years, the installed
WTG capacity has increased from 1,868 MW at the beginning of FY 2003-04 to 21,134 MW at the end of March,
2014 registering a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 24%. The year-wise wind capacity addition
is shown in the following figure:

Growth of wind energy capacity in India
Source: MNRE, March 2014
During this short span of 9 years, wind technology has emerged as a matured technology amongst various types
of renewable energy technologies. It contributes over 8% of total generation capacity while its share amongst
various renewable energy based installations constitutes over 70%. The legal clarity and certainty of regulatory
principles with formulation and enunciation of Electricity Act, 2003 together with conducive policy framework
has ensured continued interests by a number of developers in wind sector; which has ultimately resulted into
significant growth in harnessing wind energy across various States.

 2.3.2. Policy and Regulatory Landscape for wind energy in India
 2.3.2.1. Generation based incentive (GBI) mechanism
 Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) announced the revised Generation based Incentive Scheme for
 wind Power Projects, on 4th September 2013. As per the Scheme, Rs.0.50/kWh will be allowed for a period of
 ten years to the eligible Grid interactive Wind Power projects. IREDA would disburse the Generation based
 incentives to the generators on half-yearly basis through e-payment. This incentive will be over and above the
 applicable tariff approved by respective State Electricity Regulatory Commissions.



                                         Incentive of Rs.0.5/unit fed into grid;

Provisions of GBI mechanism

 MNRE announced the Generation based Incentive Scheme for wind Power Projects, on 17th December 2009.
 Under this scheme, a total of 1500 MW projects were installed.

 2.3.2.2. Accelerated Depreciation
 Under section 32 of the Income Tax Act, investors can avail advantage of ‘Accelerated Depreciation’ of up to 80
 per cent of the project cost, if the project is commissioned before September 30 of the same financial year; or 40
 per cent if the project is commissioned before March 31 of the same financial year.

 2.3.2.3. Feed in tariff mechanism (Preferential tariff)
 Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) is the world's most successful policy mechanism for stimulating the rapid development of
 renewable energy. Government of India introduced the feed-in tariff mechanism in 1995 when Ministry of New
 and Renewable Energy (then Ministry of Nonconventional Energy Sources) specified the uniform feed-in tariff
 of Rs. 2.25 per unit with an escalation of 5% per annum for all types of RE sources.
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




2.3.2.3.1. Preferential tariff for inter -state renewable projects
In the exercise of powers conferred under Section 61(h) and 178(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003, Central
Electricity Regulatory Commission has notified the “CERC (Terms and Conditions for Tariff determination
from Renewable Energy Sources) Regulation 2012?, which lays down the normative principles fo r
determination of preferential tariffs for renewable energy technology. CERC has classified wind power projects
into five categories based on wind zones and corresponding CUF has been allowed based on annual mean
power density, which is measured at 50 meter hub height.

The aforementioned regulation provides regulatory clarity and tariff certainty to the investors who have evinced
interest in developing renewable projects on inter-state basis. Also, these regulations serve as the guideline
for other State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) to frame and establish renewable specific
regulations across their respective states. Further, these regulations act instrumental in deciding the tariff for
individual renewable energy technology.

The salient features of the regulations pertaining to wind energy are mentioned below.

2.3.2.3.2. CERC Tariff Order of Wind Power for 2014-15
Following the stipulation of the CERC RE Tariff Regulation 2012, CERC under its dispensation mandated the
RE Tariff Order 2014-15 which defined the financial, operational and other technology specific norms for
determining the tariff of wind power projects commissioned during 2014-15. The main defining parameters for
wind power projects under the aforementioned tariff order are as follows:

2.3.2.3.3. Preferential tariff for intra -state renewable projects
The National Tariff Policy, enacted pursuant to Section 3 of Electricity Act, 2003 provided for preferential tariff
determination by the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions for different types of renewable energy after
taking into account the potential of RE sources and the impact on retail tariffs to be recovered from the retail
consumers. Since then, over a period of time, 18 SERCs, in order to encourage deployment of wind energy and
to provide certainty to the investors, have notified generic tariffs for wind energy resources available in their
respective States on normative basis. The existing wind energy tariffs prevalent across selected wind rich states
have been tabulated below:

2.3.2.4. Draft National Wind Mission
National Wind Mission proposes to create an enabling policy framework that minimizes the risk and cost of the
wind power deployment while sharing such reduced costs and risks appropriately amongst all the stakeholders
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




of the wind industry. The mission proposes to achieve 100,000 MW of utility scale wind installations in the
country and 1000MW of distributed wind power by the end of 13 th five year plan (end of 2022). The planned
capacity addition targets under the proposed mission are as follows:

National wind mission targets

Wind power category                    Phase 1 (2012-17)                      Phase 2 (2017-22)
Utility scale on-shore wind            20,000 MW                              50,000 MW
Off-shore wind                         1000 MW                                10,000 MW
Distributed power                      100 MW                                 1000 MW



In order to achieve the above targets, the Mission will plan to implement specific policy interventions in a time
bound manner. The contours of the enabling policy framework would include:

   Investment grade wind zone development and transmission planning by 2015.
   Development of project/land allocation framework
   GBI support to be provided during the Phase 1 of the mission over the existing tariffs proposed by SERCs.
    Following the review of capacity addition during this phase, this policy impetus would be withdrawn.
   Provision of Accelerated Depreciation (AD) for repowering projects during phase I
   Continuation of RPOs
   High level planning for grid integration
   Support to indigenous manufacturing particularly by providing interest subsidies on manufacturing of high
    grade turbines.

2.3.2.5. Tax benefits
The tax benefits offered by the central government for wind power can be classified under two categories-

   Tax benefits under direct taxes; and
   Tax benefits under indirect taxes.
Direct tax benefits include-.
   Income Tax Holiday : Under section 80-IA, wind power project developers are exempted from income tax
    on all earnings generated from the wind power project for period of 10 consecutive assessment years,
    during the first 15 years of the project life. The book profit from such undertaking, however, would attract
    Minimum Alternate Tax at 18.5 per cent (excluding surcharge and education cess) of book profit.
Indirect tax benefits include-

   Concessional Custom Duty on wind turbine components forming part of the project cost of wind project;
   Exemption in Excise Duty on wind turbine components forming part of the project cost of wind project;
    and
   Exemption in Central Sales Tax and General Sales Tax on sale of renewable energy components particularly
    component forming part wind turbines resulting in reduction of wind equipment and component cost;




2.3.3. Thrust Areas in Wind Sector
2.3.3.1. On-Shore Wind Projects
Investment in the On shore wind power projects will continue to have lions share among all the categories of
wind power generating installations. The growth of the on-shore wind market would be spearheaded by
investments in the Independent Power Producer (IPP) model and accelerated depreciation benefit driven/
captive power model.
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




2.3.3.1.1. Captive/Accelerated Depreciation benefit driven model
More investments would be committed by power-intensive manufacturing companies such as textile industrial
units, cement manufacturing entities, steel and automobile industrial units, in order to meet their captive
consumption and avail tax benefit through accelerated depreciation. Also small scale investors would be
committing investment in wind turbines to avail accelerated depreciation benefits to minimise their income tax
liabilities.

2.3.3.1.2. Independent Power Producer (IPP) Model
The major drivers for an IPP based investment will be the conducive regulatory and policy environment, policy
initiatives such as Generation Based Incentive (GBI) and regulatory initiatives, RPS/RPO, Feed-in tariff regime
and introduction of market instruments such as RECs etc. Besides, the increasing power demand and the
mounting pressure on account climate change imperatives, leads to a definite growth potential for the wind
energy sector and this shall attract IPPs to invest in wind power plants in India.

Indian wind energy market is a matured market in the world. Further, Indian market has access to proven
technology and skill-set. Thus, IPPs have a much less riskier investment option at ground. Further, IPPs are
today placed with choice of revenue models including options with multiple revenue streams. With the right
kind of strategy mix and with the choice of the right revenue model, impressive returns for the investments
could be ensured. Overall, the IPP model is looked at as an investment with a better investment economics.

2.3.3.2. Off-Shore Wind Power projects
Suzlon has preliminary estimates of India’s offshore wind potential at 25,000 MW. In November 2010, the
secretary of MNRE had announced that a study was being undertaken with the help of CWET to ascertain the
feasibility of setting up offshore wind farms in India, with 2 pilot projects in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. MNRE’s
initial feasibility study is expected to take at least 2-3 years. C-WET has also invited technical inputs from
world’s leading wind energy companies. The data from the companies would help C-WET to understand the
soil conditions in the seabed and the different structural features required for offshore wind turbines. Recent
news reports have also claimed that Indian govt. may enlist the help of ONGC in surveying offshore wind
potential in India and setting up two wind farms at sea.

In a bid to address the issues emanating while development of off-shore wind power projects in India, the
Central issued the ‘Off-Shore wind policy, 2013’.

2.3.3.2.1. Draft Off-Shore Wind Policy, 2013
The salient features of the policy have been covered below:

       Preliminary Resource Assessment and demarcation of blocks.
       EIA study of proposed wind farms regarding aquatic life, fishing etc., studies relating to navigation,
        undersea mining and related exploration/exploitation activities and other users of the sea.
       Oceanographic studies - to determine construction costs for special foundations, special ships for both
        operation and maintenance requirements.
       Developing Sea Bed Lease Arrangement.
       Providing Single Window Procedure for Statutory Approvals (NOWA).
       Developing framework for Grid Connectivity and Evacuation of Power
       Devising Fiscal and Monetary Incentives
       Establishing Security & Confidentiality of data collected during studies and surveys

2.3.4. Issues/Challenges associated with development of wind
      power projects
The present stage of wind power development is a matter of trepidation. Being highly infirm with poor
predictability, states utilities are increasingly finding it difficult to absorb higher quantum of wind power
without any linkages from load demand, power evacuation planning and other host of issues. Prominent issues
regarding the development of wind power has been illustrated below:

Challenges with development of wind power projects

Item Description           Description
Wind power                 Wind resource rich states are finding it financially difficult to create power
evacuation                 evacuation infrastructure for the existing and also for the future
                           installations. They are already burdened with the high quantum of infirm
                           wind power, which cannot be scheduled.
                           Expenditure on creating power evacuation facility is the additional
                           investment that the wind resource rich States have to incur. Now instead of
                           going for speedy deployment plans the States have started reducing or
                           freezing their purchase obligations and request have started pouring in to
                           MNRE to meet the cost on power evacuation infrastructure.
                           Another important issue associated with wind evacuation is ensuring the
                           grid stability while inter-connecting wind power to the grid. Owing to the
                           intermittent nature of the wind power, adoption of spinning reserves needs
                           to be provided.

High cost of debt          High cost of debt is the major cause of concern. Owing to intermittent
                           nature of the wind projects, the revenue streams from such projects are not
                           guaranteed which makes the lenders uncomfortable.

2.5. Solar power in India
India lies in the high solar insolation region, endowed with huge
solar energy potential, with most of the country having about
300 sunny days per year with annual mean daily global solar
radiation in the range of 5-7 kWh/sq m/day. The government
has introduced enabling policy initiatives for the solar power
generation sector in order to fulfil the growing demand for
power generation in the country.

2.5.1. Solar power development in
      India
The grid interactive solar power as of December 2010 was
merely 10 MW. However, most of the capacity addition in India
has happened in last three years, driven by series of incentives
and support extended by state and federal governments.
Realising the presence of abundant solar potential in the
                                                                 Solar map of India
country, slew of policy and enabling regulatory measures were

Solar development in India

Recognizing the immense potential and taking measures for scaling up solar has eventually lead to
identification of viable business opportunities that can be tapped by both public and private sector in the near
and medium term future.

2.5.2. Policy and Regulatory Landscape for solar energy in India
2.5.2.1. Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM)
Launched by the Government of India in January 2010, JNNSM is one of the major global initiatives in
promotion of solar energy technologies. The mission has a twin objective - to contribute to India's long term
energy security as well as its ecological security. The JNNSM would be implemented in 3 stages and aims to
have an installed capacity of 20,000 MW by the end of the 13th Five Year Plan in 2022. It is envisaged that as a
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




result of rapid scale up as well as technological developments, the price of solar power will attain parity with
grid power at the end of the Mission, enabling accelerated and large-scale expansion thereafter. The mission
includes a major initiative for promoting solar photovoltaic (PV) applications. Under First Phase of JNNSM to
be implemented between 1st April 2010 and 31st March 2013; 200MW capacity equivalent off grid solar PV
systems and 7 million square meter solar thermal collector area to be installed in the country. The targets for
JNNSM are shown below:

The National Solar Mission is a thus a major initiative of the Government of India and State Governments to
promote ecologically sustainable growth while addressing India’s energy security challenge.

2.5.2.1.1. NSM (Phase I)

In order to facilitate grid connected solar power generation in the first phase, a mechanism of “bundling?
relatively expensive solar power with power from the unallocated quota of power generated at NTPC coal based
stations, which is relatively cheaper, was proposed by the Mission. This “bundled power? would be sold to the
Distribution Utilities to reduce the cost of procuring solar power.

The Bidding process under the first phase of the National Solar Mission was split into two batches with the
understanding that this circumspect approach would leave enough room for rectification if some flaws or
shortcomings that may emerge in the first batch of bidding. The following table gives a snapshot of the bidding
outcome of both the batches of Phase-I:

2.5.2.3. CERC IEGC Regulations, 2010 - Analysis of the specific provision
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) exercising its power conferred under Section 79(1) (h)
and section 178(2) (g) of the Electricity Act, 2003 had notified the CERC (Indian Electricity Grid Code),
Regulations, 2010. This code will be applicable to NLDC, RLDC/SLDCs, ISGS, and Distribution
Licensees/SEBs/STUs/regional entities, Power Exchanges and Wind and Solar Generating Stations.

In order to encourage the solar based generation into the electricity grid, the IEGC has given due consideration
for such segment. The Grid Code provides that in case the generation from solar power project deviates from
the schedule the financial burden shall be borne by all the users of the Inter-State Grid, instead of the
concerned solar project developer. The IEGC provides the methodology for rescheduling of solar energy on
three (3) hours and the methodology of compensating the solar energy rich state for dealing with variable
generation through Renewable Regulatory Charge. In pursuance of this, appropriate meters and data
acquisition systems facility shall be provided for accounting of UI charges and transfer of information to SLDC
and RLDC. The provisions of the IEGC shall be applicable from January 1, 2011, for new solar generating plants
with capacity of 5MW and above connected to 33kV and above who have not signed any PPA with States or
others. Some of the key and enabling provisions for solar energy in IEGC are as below,

                                     If the RLDC is of opinion that the schedule is not realistic, it may
                                      ask the solar generator to modify the schedule
Implications of Scheduling           In case of solar generation no UI shall be payable/receivable by the
                                      generator for any deviation in actual generation from schedule.
                                     The host state shall bear the UI charges for deviation in the actual
                                      generation from schedule.
                                     The net UI charges borne by the host state due to solar generation,

                                      solar generating plants with capacity of 5MW and above and
                                      connected at 33Kv level and above and who have not signed PPA
                                      with states or others as on date of coming into force of this IEGC.

2.5.2.4. CERC Initiative for Transmission/Evacuation of Solar Power
Under the mandate of statutory provisions of Section 61 of the Electricity Act, 2003 inter-alia para 5.3.4 and
para 7.2(1) of the National Electricity Policy and Tariff Policy respectively, Central Electricity Regulatory
Commission (CERC) has undertaken the exercise to frame regulations on sharing of transmission charges and
losses among the users.

The regulations facilitate the solar based generation by allowing zero transmission access charges for the use of
the Inter State Transmission System and allocating no transmission loss to the solar based generation. Solar
power generators shall be benefited in event of use of the ISTS. Since such generation would normally be
connected at 33 kV, the power generated by such generators would most likely be absorbed locally. This would
cause no / minimal use of 400 kV ISTS network and might also lead to reduction of losses in the 400 kV
network by doing away the need for power from distant generators. The cost of energy from solar based
generation is perceived to be costly as compared to other sources, including renewable energy sources, and
further application of ISTS charges and losses would further reduce the acceptability of power generated from
solar sources. This regulation thus encourages solar based generation and inter-state transactions based on
solar energy.

2.5.3. Thrust Areas for solar sector
The Government plans to scale up solar to a cumulative 100GW by 2020. This would involve large scale
deployment of rooftop projects under both net metering and feed in metering to achieve 40GW of capacity till
2020; increased pace of grid connected projects so as to achieve 60GW by 2020, for this Solar parks have been
set up in Charanka (Gujarat, 500 MW) and Bhadla (Rajasthan, 1500 MW) and others have been planned in
over 12 states which are as follows:

       Gujarat – 750MW (Banaskantha)
       Madhya Pradesh – 1500MW(Rewa)
       Telangana- 1000MW(Mehboobnagar)
       Andhra Pradesh- 2500MW(Anantpur, Kurnool and Kadapa)
       Karnataka- 1000MW(Bijapur)
       Uttar Pradesh- 250MW(Jalaun)
       Meghalaya-50MW
       Jammu and Kashmir- 7500MW (Leh and Kargil)
       Punjab- 1000MW (Land identified)
       Rajasthan- 700MW (Land identified)
       Tamil Nadu- 500MW (Location not identified)
       Odisha- 1000MW (Location not identified)
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




The targeted increase in rooftop solar from 285 MW to 40,000 MW over a period of about 6 years would
require enabling policies and favourable investment regimes on the part of the government. Successful
implementation of these targets would put India as one of the global leaders in terms of solar energy and
provide capacity to meet the much required demand growth in the country.

2.5.4. Issues/Challenges associated with development of solar
      power projects
As the India Solar program moves from policy to implementation, several issues and concerns have surfaced
proving to be major hurdles for serious solar power developers and lenders. In fact is several projects allotted
may not get deployed. Financing and bankability of solar projects under the JNNSM is emerging to be a major
concern, arising from several issues in the policy or inadequacies therein. Thus, despite an apparently
improved policy and support provided, solar power development remains expensive and risky for developers
and lenders. These issues of concern are discussed here:

       Reliability of solar irradiation data: The biggest risk associated with solar projects lies with the
        estimation of solar radiation. The returns of a solar project are highly sensitive to radiation levels. High
        quality solar radiation data is a prerequisite for proper market assessment and project development.
        Hence, solar radiation assessment is a very important activity and typically requires several months for
        ground measurement of solar radiations. Any error in solar resource estimation adds an uncertainty to
        expected outputs. According to Power Finance Corporation, as of now, on-ground solar radiation data
        is sketchy and the simulation models are at best at a preliminary stage. The industry is relying on
        suboptimal solutions in the absence of credible and adequate data. Non availability of standardised
        information is leading to the developers opting different sources of information and hence bankers and
        financers are finding it very difficult to rely on the provided data and proceed with investments.

        MNRE has initiated steps in this direction, with the Centre for Wind Energy Technology being assigned
        to set up 51 ground monitoring stations in association with the states. Probable sites have been
        identified in states including Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya
        Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Puducherry, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.

       Financial Risk: Banks and financial institutions remain averse to the idea of lending to solar power
        projects. While the general perception about solar technologies has improved over the years, the
        technical risk perception remains high. As a result, there is a dearth of non-recourse or project
        financing for solar projects. Most of the lenders insist on recourse to either the parent company’s
        balance sheet or a performance bond for the project. Industry experience in the energy sector has
        shown that capacity addition would not have been possible had financing been limited to only balance
        sheets. Clearly, this could defeat the larger objectives of jump-starting capacity addition in solar power.

       Domestic manufacturing: Government has stipulated local sourcing for cells, panels and other
        equipment for half of the available capacity under Phase II Batch I of JNNSM projects. If this
        continues, developers will have to procure higher cost equipment if they want to bid under the DCR
        category. Also, developers are apprehensive about the ability of domestic manufacturers to meet the
        required demand. Currently, there is a very limited manufacturing capacity in India and the Indian
        market requires large-scale manufacturing facilities to leverage pricing, supply and research
        capabilities.

       Land acquisition risks: Procuring land is a major barrier facing solar project development. The
        process of land acquisition differed from state to state. While Gujarat gave a free hand to developers to
        choose based on the developers criteria (the type of land they needed), Rajasthan adopted a different
        path of first identifying government waste land for developing solar power projects and then allotting
        them to various developers. The lead time to acquire land in states could range anywhere between 6-12
        months and in some cases more than a year.
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




         Evacuation: Lack of Planning and sharing of information by the respective state transmission utilities
          with the developers is seen as one of the major concerns by most of the project developers in finalizing
          their project locations. Typically, state utilities do not publicize their present and future infrastructural
          plans of setting up of new transmission lines and evacuation infrastructure, it is a major threat as
          concerned and upcoming developers are not aware of any developments in the area thus posing a major
          risk involving bad planning and changing policies.

2.6. Rural Electrification: A Review of Policy and
    Regulatory Framework
The government of India has taken several initiatives for rural electrification from time to time. The Electricity
Act, 2003 and the Rural Electrification Policy, 2006, are two such milestone initiatives. This section provides a
brief overview and analysis of select schemes, policies and programmes as well as the key enabling provisions
under the prevailing regulatory framework for rural electrification in India as a basis for developing innovative
business models involving the private sector in rural electrification in future for effective large-scale
deployment of decentralised power generation.

2.6.1. Evolution of Rural Electrification in India
India’s rural electrification programme was initiated in the 1950s, and its evolution can be divided into five
distinctive stages.

With the emergence of renewable energy, MNRE also implemented several programmes to promote cleaner
and renewable energy technologies such as solar, biomass, and biogas for providing electricity to remote un-
electrified villages and hamlets to support rural electrification through grid extension. The major programmes
include VESP (which focused on biomass based technologies), RVEP (which shifted its focus with time to solar
home lighting), and the recently launched Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM).

2.6.2. Enabling Regulatory Framework: Provisions under E-Act
      2003
Electricity Act, 2003 explicitly mentions the formulation of a national electricity policy (NEP), a national tariff
policy, and a plan for the development of power systems to ensure optimal utilization of all resources including
renewable sources of energy. The Act has also created several other enabling provisions to accelerate the
development of renewable-energy-based generation and also lays special emphasis on rural electrification. The
Act mandates the central government to formulate policies permitting stand-alone systems, including systems
based on renewable and non-conventional energy, for rural electrification. The key Sections of EA 2003 are
summarized below.




The proposed amendment to the Electricity Act 2003, also provide specific provisions for encouraging the usage
of renewable energy sources across the rural areas. Some of the amendments congruent to promoting rural
electrification through harnessing of renewable energy sources have been specified below:

       Section 4(1): The Central Government shall, after consultation with the State Governments, prepare
        and notify a national policy, permitting stand-alone systems (including those based on renewable
        sources of energy and other non-conventional sources of energy) for rural areas within six months
        from the date of coming into force of this Act.

       Section 4(2): The Central Government and the concerned State Governments shall jointly create
        necessary infrastructure in rural areas to harness solar power and other forms of renewable energy
        to ensure access to electricity to every rural household by the year 2020.".
Renewable Energy Sector Overview




          Section 6(1): The Central Government shall, in consultation with the State Governments, as soon as
           possible but not later than six months from the date of coming into force of this Act, prepare and
           notify a national policy aimed at encouraging the use of renewable sources of energy to
           ensure electrification in rural and urban areas.

2.6.2.1. Rural Electrification Policy, 2006
Ministry of Power notified the Rural Electrification Policy in 2006 to comply with section 4 and 5 of the
Electricity Act, 2003. The goals of this policy are to provide electricity to all households by 2009, through
quality and reliable power supply at a reasonable price and achieve a minimum consumption of 1 unit of
electricity per household per day by 2012.

The policy aims to achieve rural electrification primarily by grid connectivity or by off grid solutions and stand-
alone systems where grid connectivity is not feasible or economical. In case of areas where even stand-alone
systems are not feasible, isolated systems like solar PV will be provided for basic lighting and electrification
needs.

To support this policy, the government launched the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY),
where capital subsidy up to 90% could be provided for village electrification. The Rural Electrification
Corporation under the Ministry of Power is the nodal agency of RGGVY.

2.6.2.2. Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana
      (RGGVY)
RGGVY was launched in April 2005 by merging several existing rural electrification schemes with REC as the
nodal agency for the program. The main aims of this program are:

    To electrify all villages and habitations in India
    To provide access to electricity to all rural households
    To provide electricity connection to below poverty line families free of charge
The electricity will be provided either by grid connectivity, wherever possible and economically feasible or
through DDG systems powered by conventional or non-conventional sources of energy, where grid connectivity
is not feasible.

Under RGGVY, 90% grant is provided by the central government and 10% through loan from REC to the state
governments to implement rural electrification projects. For Below Poverty Line (BPL) households, RGGVY
provides 100% electricity connection subsidy of Rs. 2,200 per BPL household. The scheme estimated 125,000
un-electrified villages at its inception and estimated Rs. 8,125 crore with connectivity to 10% of the households.
For electrification of BPL households, an estimate of Rs. 3,510 crore was calculated. The cost estimation of the
scheme was also included augmentation in already electrified villages containing un-electrified inhabitations
with an estimate of Rs. 4,620 crore. The total outlay for RGGVY scheme was then computed to be Rs. 16,000
crore with the central government contribution to be Rs. 14,750 crore.

The RGGVY scheme was continued in the 11th Plan and Rs. 28,000 crore1 were sanctioned for this scheme in the
11th Plan. In this phase of RGGVY, 90% of the subsidy will be provided by the central government and the
additional 10% of the cost will be provided by the states through their own resources or through loans from
financial institutions.

For projects to be eligible under RGGVY, the state government of the village needs:

      To guarantee a minimum daily supply of 6-8 hours of electricity with the assurance of meeting any deficit
       by supplying electricity at subsidized tariff

Renewable Energy Sector Overview




      To deploy franchisees for the management of rural distribution in these projects and to undertake
       necessary steps to operationalize this scheme



2.6.2.3. Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojna
In rural areas of the country, the agricultural and non-agricultural load (domestic and non-domestic) is
typically catered through common distribution network. Availability of power supply in rural areas is erratic in
most parts of the country. Besides non-availability of adequate power, common distribution network for
agricultural and non-agricultural load is also considered as one of the major constraints for supply of adequate
reliable power to rural area. Distribution utilities, to mitigate the gap between supply and demand practise
frequent load shedding in rural areas and in the process, non-agricultural consumers are also deprived of
supply since they are fed from the same feeder. To overcome this situation various states have undertaken
capital investment program to separate agricultural load from non-agricultural load in the rural areas. Feeder
separation refers to supply of electricity to agricultural consumers and non-agricultural consumers (domestic
and non-domestic) separately through dedicated feeders. This arrangement allows the distribution company to
selectively control power supply to agricultural consumers as and when needed for effective Demand Side
Management (DSM). The separation of feeders helps in flattening of the load curve by shifting the agricultural
load to off-peak hours and thus helps in load management. Since the continual infusion of fund is required and
considering the financial health of the government owned state utilities, Government of India is providing
support to this initiative.


Government of India launched the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana on August 2014 with an objective
to :

          To separate agriculture and non-agriculture feeders in rural areas;
          To facilitate Discoms in the judicious rostering of supply to agricultural & nonagricultural consumers in
           rural areas;
          Strengthening and Augmentation of Sub Transmission & Distribution infrastructure in rural areas.

The proposed initiative is applicable for the remaining years of the 12th plan period and would be further
continued during the 13th plan. Total cost of the scheme is Rs. 43033 Crore and requirement of Government
Budgetary Support (GBS) from Govt. of India is Rs. 33453 Crore over the implementation period. REC has been
appointed as the nodal agency for this initiative. Government of India would provide 90% and 75% of the total
amount as the grant across the special category states and other states beyond the special category status.


2.6.2.4. Rural Electrification Corporation Decentralized
      Distributed Generation Scheme
The Indian Government launched a scheme in 2009 under RGGVY for village electrification through
Decentralized Distributed Generation in the 11 th Plan with a sanctioned capital subsidy of Rs. 540 crore 2 from
the Rs. 28,000 crore approved for RGGVY. REC was appointed the nodal agency of this scheme. This scheme
complements the RGGVY as it aims to electrify villages where grid connectivity is not feasible or economical.
The villages under the DDG scheme can be provided electricity through conventional sources of energy or
through renewable energy including small hydro, biomass, biogas, solar, etc.

The projects implemented under the DDG scheme will be owned by the state government with the state
renewable energy development agencies as the implementing agencies. The villages will be selected by the state
renewable energy development agency in consultation with MNRE. Villages or hamlets having a population of
less than 100 inhabitants will not be included in the DDG scheme and will be taken up in MNRE schemes of
rural electrification. The DDG scheme will be monitored by a committee with the Secretary (Power) as the head.

Renewable Energy Sector Overview




For implementing these projects, services of the Central Public Sector Undertakings have been offered to the
states, with REC entering into MoUs with NTPC, NHPC, Power Grid Corporation and DVC.

Under the scheme, 90% of the total project cost will be provided as subsidy by the implementing agency and the
rest 10% will be arranged by the implementing agency or through loans from financial institutions or REC.

2.6.2.5. MNRE Remote Village Electrification Programme
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy launched the Remote Village Lighting Programme in 2005 to
support the National Electricity Policy and the Rural Electricity Policy in their aim to achieve complete
electrification of India. This scheme is supplementing the efforts of the prevalent Indian Government schemes
and programs for electrification like RGGVY and REC DDG schemes and included villages where grid
connected electrification is not feasible and economical. The villages listed were the ones not under RGGVY
DDG programmes, and mandate was given to MNRE to electrify these villages by renewable energy sources. In
this scheme, MNRE provided a subsidy of up to 90% of the capital costs of the renewable energy systems.

This scheme was replaced by the Remote Village Electrification Programme of MNRE in 2009 with the same
objective of rural electrification through renewable energy technologies of un-electrified villages. The selection
of villages for this scheme is being done in a similar way with the important criteria of un-feasibility of grid
connectivity and the village not being covered under RGGVY. For selection of villages, the state governments
will send a list of short-listed villages to MNRE, which will be verified by REC. In this scheme also, renewable
energy plants or hybrid plants will be installed in the selected villages based on renewable energy technologies
including small hydro, biomass, bio fuels, wind, biogas, etc. Solar lighting will be used for households and
community establishments when no other renewable energy technology is feasible. However, it has been
observed by MNRE that solar PV lighting has been the preferred mode of electrification in this scheme.

MNRE will provide CFA of up to 90% of the renewable energy projects, including annual maintenance costs for
5 years for the approved projects. CFA for a SPV home lighting systems is provided for all BPL households in all
approved villages and hamlets for electrification under this scheme. The maximum CFA from MNRE for
electrification of a village or hamlet will be Rs. 18,000 per household.

This scheme received a total outlay of Rs. 95 crores in 2011-12, Rs. 80 crore each in 2010-11 and 2009-103. Out
of the total funding Rs. 25 crore were earmarked for the North- Eastern region as it is one of the most remote
regions in India with un-electrified and sparsely populated villages. 4

2.6.2.6. MNRE Technology Specific Schemes
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has also been running technology specific schemes and programs
covering biomass, bio-gasification, small-hydro and solar technologies. These schemes are mainly to provide
capital subsidy for investors setting up power plants based on these technologies for off grid and industry
application including rural electrification. These salient features of this scheme for each technology are:

Technology                         Features of the Scheme
Biomass Gasifier                   Capital subsidy of Rs. 15,000/ KW for off grid power plants in rural areas
                                   limited to 250 kW installed capacity. The project can be set up following a
                                   cluster approach.
Biogas                             Capital subsidy upto 40% of capital cost or Rs. 40000/ KW (3-20 kW), Rs.
                                   35,000/ kW (20-100 kW), Rs. 30,000/ kW (100-250 kW) whichever is less.
                                   Support towards DPR preparation is also provided.
Solar PV                           For solar mini grid projects, subsidy can be availed for upto 250 kW per site.
                                   Subsidy of Rs. 90/ Wp with battery backup is the benchmark subsidy.

Challenges to development of Renewable Energy and RE based Rural Electrification in India




3. Challenges to development of
   Renewable Energy and RE based
   Rural Electrification in India
3.1.1. Challenges in development of Renewable Energy
Challenges to the renewable energy sector in the country can be classified into the following:

Policy barriers

    •    Absence of comprehensive RE law: The EA, 2003, has some enabling provisions to promote grid-
         connected RE sources. However, there are no legally binding targets facilitating the creation,
         transmission and deployment of renewable energy or provision for accelerating all-round development
         of renewable energy. Hence, India needs to enact a comprehensive law to facilitate renewable energy
         development.

    •    Cohesion of state targets with national objectives: It is observed that the state planning board does not
         specify RE capacity-addition targets while planning the energy/power sector activities. It does not event
         take cognisance of the envisaged targets at the national level to set up the state targtes. The dynamic RE
         target setting by the state planning board will have a positive impact on the RE sector.

    •    According single-window clearance to RE projects: Project proponents are required to take number of
         permissions or approvals from the various state government departments and agencies prior to the
         commissioning of an RE project, resulting in delayed implementation and commissioning. All states
         may be persuaded to create empowered committees to accord single-window clearance for setting RE
         projects at the state level.



Regulatory barriers

    •    Lack of enforcement of RPOs: Although the RPO levels have been specified by the regulator at the state
         level, their concrete enforcement is still to be seen. There have been few cases where penalty has been
         imposed by the regulator, but it is yet to be enforced uniformly across all states.

    •    Transmission planning for RE development: Non-availability of evacuation infrastructure and grid
         integration challenges are among the biggest problems affecting RE project development. As per the
         EA, 2003, development of evacuation infrastructure and providing grid connectivity for RE sources is
         considered as the responsibility of the transmission utility. However, in practice, in many states, it is
         the RE developer who has to first construct such infrastructure.

    •    Homogeneity in interconnectivity norms: Interconnection of the RE projects with the grid is another
         important aspect where there is no consistency in the definition of ‘interconnection point’ across the
         state. The interconnection point is often left to the whims of the local utility.

    •    Uncertainty of REC price certainty after 2017: The CERC has announced floor prices and forbearance
         prices for RECs only until 2017. This has led to uncertainty regarding revenues from RECs beyond this
         time frame. This makes it difficult for FIs to lend to projects based on RECs because such loans
         normally extend beyond 10 years.
Challenges to development of Renewable Energy and RE based Rural Electrification in India




    •    Open access: Third-party power sales by RE projects are charged an open access levy, which includes a
         cross subsidy surcharge and an electricity duty (except in states where these have been exempted). The
         levy of these charges makes third party sales more expensive.



Financial barriers

    •    No priority sector lending for RE: At present, the priority sector broadly comprises agriculture, small-
         scale industries, and other activities/borrowers. The inclusion of RE in the priority sector will increase
         the availability of credit to this sector and lead to larger participation by commercial banks in this
         sector.

    •    Feed-in tariffs (FiTs): FiTs are one of the most successful and effective policy instruments globally for
         promoting RE generation. However, FiTs have to be designed carefully, keeping in view the prevailing
         market conditions, state of technology development and availability of resources. If the FiT is too high,
         it leads to unwarranted profits for developers, and if set too low, the FiT can lead to very low financial
         returns leading to low investments in the sector.

Experience shows that the FiTs designed by certain SERCs have been unable to attract investments. There is a
need for adoption of more robust processes and methodologies for determining FiTs that include detailed due
diligence on costs and performance parameters of various technologies, so as to make these attractive for both
debt and equity investors.

    •    Accelerated depreciation: Given that accelerated depreciation can only be utilised by profit-making
         entities with appreciable tax liabilities and cannot be transferred, it effectively excludes most IPPs and
         investors who plan on using a SPV route for project development. This limits the impact of the
         instrument and constrains the level of investment entering the sector.

Market barriers

    •    Off-taker risk: The creditworthiness of the off-taker (the state distribution companies in the case of
         sales to the state) plays a key role in determining the bankability of a PPA. Very few discoms, such as
         those in Gujarat and Maharashtra, are in good financial health. In other states, discoms have poor
         financial health; the risk of off-taker default and delayed payments is high.

    •    Evacuation risk: Evacuation is a generic problem afflicting wind, solar and the small-hydro sector. Lack
         of adequate evacuation facilities has led to scaling back the commissioning and partial commissioning
         of new generation and the reduction of generation during peak periods. This issue is constraining the
         development of small-hydro projects across the northern and northeastern states (HP, Uttarakhand,
         and north-eastern states), solar development in the remote areas of Rajasthan and wind in Tamil Nadu.

3.1.2. Challenges in development of RE based Rural Electrification
      Initiatives
The extension of the electricity grid is one of the prominent and obvious solutions to effective rural
electrification. However, such a mechanism entails significant investment in building the necessary
infrastructure. The alternate solution for effective rural electrification is through deployment of off-
grid/decentralised generation systems that exploit resources available locally. However, encouraging rural
electrification through installation of off-grid systems based on renewable energy sources will require
identification of specific issues and finding suitable technical and commercial solution with adequate support of
regulatory measures. Some of the challenges limiting the development of RE-based rural electrification projects
are as follows:
Challenges to development of Renewable Energy and RE based Rural Electrification in India




        The major barrier for large scale deployment of renewable and its utilisation for rural electrification is
         large capital investment, and therefore, higher cost of electricity generation, making it unviable in
         comparison to subsidised grid tariff.

        Further, the investors also vary about the tariff for the purchase of the power generated from such
         plants by the distribution utility once the grid comes in the picture.

4. PPP case studies
Snapshots of cases from India and overseas have been included below to provide an overview of some key
projects while not intending to be an exhaustive list or amount of detail.

4.1. Wind project at Curepipe Point, Mauritius
The Mauritius government, as part of its long-term strategy of sourcing 35% of its electricity from renewables
by 2025, selected the Curepipe Point site for the development of a 30 MW wind power project on PPP basis. A
consortium of Padgreen Co. & Valum Holding BV (74%) and Suzlon Energy (26%) was selected as the preferred
bidder for undertaking this project. After the selection of this consortium, the Energy Supply and Purchase
Agreement (ESPA) was signed on 3 August 2012 between the consortium and the Central Electricity Board
(CEB), Government of Republic of Mauritius, for a period of 20 years. The tariff was quoted in both US dollars
(USD) and Mauritian rupee (MUR), to be paid in MUR to reduce the foreign exchange risk for the developer.

Obtaining clearances and approvals including land were the responsibility of the project developer, with
assistance from the CEB. Among the main issues faced by the developer was identification of suitable and
adequate land for the project. The initially identified site had to be changed as land available was inadequate for
a 30 MW project. The new location had its own problems including proximity to a lake (largest lake in
Mauritius) and in line with the flight landing path. After consultations and minor changes, the project got all
the clearances and approvals and was set to commence generation in 2014.

    the bidding process to instill confidence and reduce project implementation time and risks
   Government utility (CEB) has partially mitigated exchange rate risk by procuring 80% of the
    power in USD



4.2. GAIL Wind Power Project in Karnataka and Tamil
    Nadu
GAIL as an IPP and an investor undertook an open and competitive bidding process to select an Engineering,
procurement and construction contractor (EPC) in order to set up the proposed project (an approximately 24
MW wind project) and also provide O&M services for an initial period of 10 years. Towards this, the bidder will
also need to allocate a suitable area of land for the project and obtain all the requisite clearances and approvals.

Under this project, a 10.5 MW plant was set up in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu and a 12.6 MW wind project in
Sidhenpur, Karnataka. The power purchase agreement (PPA) was signed with the utilities at the applicable
feed-in tariff. The applicable tariffs were 3.39 INR per kWh and 3.70 INR per kWh for Tamil Nadu and
Karnataka respectively.

This transaction commenced September 2011, and the EPC contract was awarded to Suzlon in November 2011,
and the project was commissioned in 2012.

4.3. Simran Wind Power Project
Simran Wind Project Ltd (Simran) is a wind power generator and a subsidiary of the Techno Electric and
Engineering Company (TEEC). TEEC acquired Simran from Suzlon in 2009. It currently has an installed
capacity of 162.35 MW with projects located in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Going forward, it plans to have an
installed wind power capacity of 800 MW by FY 2018.

In FY 2012, Simran set up a 111.9 MW project in Tamil Nadu in the regions of Rasta, Muthiampatti and
Amuthapuram. The project is located in a high-wind density area with a projected average CUF of 27.5%. The
project signed a 20-year PPA with the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited
(TANGEDCO ) in order to supply power at an average power purchase cost (APPC) tariff of 2.37 INR per kWh
which was revised to 2.54 INR per kWh. The project is eligible for RECs and is registered with the GBI scheme.
It has also registered itself with the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) mechanism of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Simran has tied up with the International Financial Corporation Post-2012 Carbon Facility which will forward
the purchase of 1.75 million certified emission reduction (CERs) generated through 2020. This facility will off-
set some of the risk that arises from price uncertainty in the carbon market. IFC also provided funding to the
subsidiary for this project as well as for other pipeline projects. It infused an equity of 15 million USD and has
provided a loan of 40 million USD loan to this particular project. It has also committed to lend another 40
million USD for future projects.

   Diversification of revenue streams reduces the default risk of utilities but increases
    uncertainty of cash flows.




4.4. Charanka Solar Park, Gujarat
To promote solar development in Gujarat, the Gujarat government has developed a solar park in Charanka,
Patan District, Gujarat with an area of 3,000 acres, sufficient for a solar PV generation capacity of 590 MW.
Towards this initiative, the Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL) was appointed as the nodal agency for
the Gujarat Solar Park and is primarily responsible for the development of the park and leasing the land to
project developers, while the Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation Limited (GETCO) is mandated to
develop the transmission evacuation from the identified interconnection points. Twenty0-two solar projects
were allocated land at the Charanka Solar Park, and till date projects with a capacity of around 224 MW have
been commissioned.

Once the idea of the solar power park was set, independent power producers were invited to help build it.
Government subsidies, fixed tariff for solar power and clever marketing, in tandem with ADB’s solid backing,
eventually convinced 84 private companies —21 of which were for the Charanka site—to invest in the Gujarat.

The list of IPPs operating in the Charanka Solar Park along with their capacities is:

4.5. Gandhinagar Photovoltaic Rooftop Programme
In order to promote clean energy and self-sustainability, the government of Gujarat has promoted the
Gandhinagar Photovoltaic Rooftop Programme. The objective of this programme is to maximise installations of
solar PV systems on rooftops and terraces of private homes, commercial and institutional buildings, and
government buildings. These SPV systems, installed on rooftops and terraces, will convert sunlight directly into
electricity and feed into the electrical grid. The programme is the first of its kind in India and aims to be a
benchmark for green energy generation at the household-level. Under this programme, the government of
Gujarat (GoG) will select a limited number of solar project Developers through a transparent competitive
bidding process.

Each developer will install photovoltaic systems on various buildings and houses. They will invest in the capital
for photovoltaic systems, further; they will own and maintain these photovoltaic systems. They will earn their
revenue by generating solar electricity from these systems and selling it back into the electricity grid to the local
distribution licensee.

  Key points
   Project developers bid for the project and earn revenue by feeding power into the
       electricity grid to the local distribution licensee.

      Utilisation of vacant rooftops and revenue stream (generation based) for rooftop owners,
       who are now stakeholders in the project.

      This PPP project had a high tariff of more than 11 INR per kWh (included a charge for
       rooftop owners of 3 INR per kWh) - higher than ground mounted- which could be due to
       small size of individual projects.

4.7. Roberto Santos Soccer Stadium, City of Salvador,
    State of Bahia, Brazil
A solar photovoltaic generator with approximate power of 400 kW (peak) will be installed at the rooftop of the
Roberto Santos Soccer Stadium and connected to the state of Bahia’s power grid.

The electricity generated by the solar plant on the stadium’s rooftop will be used by its own facilities during the
day and surplus power will be used by SETRE (Labour, Employment, Income and Sports Department of Bahia)
through Coelba’s distribution network. The solar energy generation will provide the stadium with savings of
630MWhper year.

 For the Brazilian energy sector this project may not only hold significant scientific and technological value, but
also economic and social interests. Solar photovoltaic generation should, in the near future, be readily
integrated into the energy matrix.

   Determinants for PPP structuring in
   RE
5.1. Learnings from Case Studies
The wind and solar PPP case studies prepared in section 4 help in assessing the benefits of different PPP
structures that can help accelerate deployment of renewable energy in India. Some of the important learnings
from the case studies are:

Particulars                                               Learnings
Responsibility of Site and land identification            Project developers of the RE projects in the present scenario
                                                          owes the responsibility of land and site which results in the
                                                          chances of implementation risk and time over-run
Accordance of clearance to projects                       Project developers in the current scenario owes the
                                                          responsibility of seeking all level of clearances which results in
                                                          the chances of implementation risk and time over-run
Structuring of incentives for RE sector                   Incentives such as GBI and AD a major reason for pushing
                                                          investments in RE but despite this tariffs have tended to
                                                          remain high and a focus on different incentives such as
                                                          lowering cost of loans during operations rather than grants for
                                                          capital investment might be better
Electrification in rural areas being provided             Schemes such as RGGVY have been good in focusing on
but no power in the grid                                  infrastructure development for rural areas but with no power
                                                          in the grid, it has tended to ignore the output impact such as
                                                          actual increase in per capita consumption. Additionally the
                                                          present PPP structuring does not comfort the developers to
                                                          participate in the scheme


The absence of aforementioned assertions in the current implementation models leads to apprehensions among
the lender community to finance the project. Structuring projects under a suitable mode PPP mode is
imperative. The PPP variant should provide the one stop show wherein the responsibility of executing the
competent authority (which is the utility) provides the clearances and approvals for the project. Also, it is
desired that the land identification along with getting the clearances is undertaken by the competent authority
which shields the developer from getting into the hassles of seeking land clearances. Additionally, it is expected
that the financial support needs to be extended by the government to the bidders which could be used to
leverage to secure loans from lenders at a cheaper rate.

5.2. Determinants for PPP structuring in RE sector
For successful culmination of a PPP model, it is desirable to present a clear perspective on the issues associated
with the operating sector. Specifically, the sector diagnostics will entail the following:
     Technical issues
     Legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks
        Institutional and capacity status; and
     Commercial, financial, and economic issues
As a result of the sector diagnostic,the government is able to determine to what degree an enabling
environment exists for a PPP and the activities required in advance of a PPP in order to create such an
environment. The diagnostic is important to achieve the following:
Learnings from Case Studies and Determinants for PPP structuring in RE




       Bring a perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of the sector and the most promising areas for
        efficiency increases
       Regularly gauge and report on the progress of reform
     Tweak the reform program as and when needed
Therefore, it is imperative to understand the involvement of the aforementioned factors in the solar and wind
space.

5.2.1. Technical Issues in Renewable Sector:
It is important to assess the technical constraints in the sector where the PPP model will be applied. All
operational issues owing to technical limitations need to be catalogued, to the degree that such information is
relevant to the reform and can be obtained in a cost-effective manner.

Infirm nature of wind and solar power causes perturbation in the local grids. Low capacity utilisation factors
(CUF) for these renewable power technologies compounds the issue since it causes network stability challenges
and also increases the cost. Higher quantum of renewable power requires a corresponding power evacuation
facility and therefore states have to incur an additional cost for creation of transmission infrastructure.
Renewable energy being in-firm, states have to create a spinning reserve. Although with proper planning and
integration and availability of other sources, spinning reserves requirements can be reduced, it still results in
additional costs.

5.2.2. Legal, Regulatory and Policy Frameworks:
Enabling legal, regulatory, and policy environments are critical in order to build a sustainable PPP model. It is
important to have a legal environment that can support private sector involvement in critical services. To the
degree that the legal and judicial environment is not defined, investors and project participants will see the
project as unpredictable and highly risky.

The Electricity Act 2003 provided the first comprehensive framework for the development of renewable power
in India at the national level. It included essential elements of a preferential tariff for renewable-based
electricity and a mandatory renewable purchase obligation (RPO) for power utility companies, especially at the
state level. This led to the introduction of the renewable energy certificate (REC) scheme in 2010 in order to
enable state electricity distribution companies to fulfil their RPO by trading RECs. Other national power
policies that were mandated by the 2003 Act also incorporated important features for renewables. The
National Electricity Policy 2005 stipulated the progressive increase of RPO and mandated a competitive
bidding process for their purchase by power distribution companies. The National Tariff Policy 2006
required SERCs to fix the minimum percentage of state RPO and to set a preferential rate for renewable power
in their states.

5.2.3. Institutional structure established:
PPPs require a range of stakeholders within and outside the government in order to take on new roles or
perform existing roles in improved ways. Often, new entities are created, such as regulators or PPP units, to
manage the process. Institutional roles must be clarified at the latest by the time the PPP process is complete.
However, greater the degree of uncertainty about institutional roles during the PPP process, higher the level of
perceptive risk is likely for potential investors. However, the present institutional set-up for developing
renewable energy is well established. It has linkages and synergies with all the relevant stakeholders both at the
central and state level to bring desired scaling of renewable energy technologies.
Learnings from Case Studies and Determinants for PPP structuring in RE




Stakeholders in the renewable energy Sector in India


Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE): The MNRE is the leading ministry for all matters
related to new and renewable energy, including planning national policies and promoting the development and
deployment of new and renewable energy. It also undertakes initiatives harnessing renewable power and
renewable energy in rural areas for lighting, cooking and motive power that is, engines and vehicles. There are
a number of R&D institutes under the MNRE, including the Solar Energy Centre (SEC) and the Centre for Wind
Energy Technology (C-WET) which validates sites for wind projects. The MNRE also co-ordinates with state
nodal agencies.

The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA): Under the administrative control of the
MNRE, the IREDA was established in 1987 as a non-banking financial institution in order to provide financial
assistance for renewable energy and energy conservation projects. It selects projects for financial assistance
and implements government incentive programmes, including the Grid Based Incentive (GBI). Recently, it has
launched its refinance scheme for promoting solar projects in the grid and off-grid space.

Regulatory commissions (CERC and SERCs):As per the CERC Regulation, ‘Terms and Conditions for
Tariff Determination for Renewable Energy Sources’ of 2012, the CERC has the authority to set the generic
tariff rates for renewable-based electricity from the following categories: wind, small hydro, biomass, solar PV,
and thermal and non-fossil fuel-based co-generation. This tariff serves as a benchmark for specific renewable
power projects. At the state level, SERCs have rights to decide on state RPOs and renewable tariffs, in
consideration of the CERC guideline


State governments:
The role of renewable energy varies among states. Generally, state governments approve all projects within
their states, including land acquisition and especially, water allocation for solar thermal projects. The state
energy agencies run their own renewable programmes. Some states, including Gujarat and Karnataka, have
their own independent solar policies and generation-based tariffs that are applicable upon signing a PPA with
the state discoms. Some states offer incentives in order to increase investment. For example, Maharashtra
provides a single window clearance process for land acquisition.

Private companies:There are a large and growing number of private renewable companies in India and some
are already globally established. Their core competencies, in terms of manufacturing capacity, technological
advancement and operational experience, will play a key role in developing India’s renewable sector into a
world-class level. Various international institutions also actively engage in India’s renewable sector. As
aforementioned, following the understanding of the roles of different stakeholders, it is imperative to
understand the concurring commercial issues associated with the RE sector.
Learnings from Case Studies and Determinants for PPP structuring in RE




5.2.4. Commercial, Financial and Economic Issues:
The current commercial, financial, and economic arrangements and outcomes of the sector need to be
understood as well as assessed. The understanding of the current scenario influences decisions about the
desired sector outcomes and how these might be achieved. Commercial considerations relate to the business
orientation of the infrastructure service provider who may become a partner in the PPP structure. In
preparation to a PPP, preliminary improvements to the customer base, the status of receivables, and funding
arrangements may be necessary. These may be needed in order to fully understand or to improve the financial
position of the service provider prior to entering into a PPP. Financial considerations relate to the design of the
detailed and realistic pricing (including customer tariffs, off-take agreements, etc.) strategies. The objective is to
provide affordable services, encouraging use, while providing the private partner with revenue sufficient for
commercially viable operations. Sometimes, the government’s provision of financial support through
investment contributions or other forms of ‘viability gap’ support or even ongoing s ubsidies can achieve this
balance.

With regards to commercial issues afflicting the renewable sector, it is at the risk of default in the payment
from the distribution licensees across the states. The financial health of licensees is not sound leading to loss of
revenue realisation for the generator. In the context of the potential as well as the emerging interest in the
renewable energy sector, it is likely that banks desirous of financing renewable energy projects may be unable to
do so, by virtue of having exhausted their sectoral exposure limit for the infrastructure or power sector. It will
be necessary to ensure that the otherwise bankable RE projects are not deprived of bank finance merely on
account of the fact that they belong to a relatively new sector, which is clubbed with an existing sector for which
the exposure limit may have already been exhausted. It will therefore be desirable for banks to consider fixing
separate exposure limits for financing the RE sector. These limits can be fixed, taking into account the risk
factors relevant to the RE sector, and can either be fixed as independent limits for the sector, or can be carved
out as sub-limits within the overall exposure limits for the infrastructure or power sector.

6. Proposed Approach for Rural
  Electrification through PPP in
  Renewable Energy
6.1. Rural Electrification Sector Background
Expanding electrification is critical to the economic and social development of the country. Despite the
implementation of large-scale programmes over the years, India’s achievement in providing access to electricity
leaves much to be desired. According to the recent Census 2011 data, only 67% of the total households use
electricity as a source of lighting, while remaining section of the population still have to resort to other sources
such as kerosene. It is discouraging to note that in the last 10 years, electricity coverage has increased by only 11
percentage points. The fundamental reason for this appalling scenario comes from the rural segment. In urban
areas, almost 93% of households use electricity as the primary source of lighting, while the corresponding
proportion in the rural segment is only 55%. However, the current rural electrification as of October 2014
stands out at 95% throughout the country. So it can be inferred that although the RGGVY had managed to
extend grid infrastructure to most of the census villages by the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan (2007–2012),
adequate and reliable power supply remains a distant dream.

Under the RGGVY, most of the census villages were covered and grid infrastructure extended to these villages
in the 11th Five-Year Plan. This coverage, however, makes it difficult to find sizeable numbers of ‘unelectrified’
census villages for future implementation, making a cluster of contiguous unelectrified villages even rarer. At
the same time, hamlets or other small settlements variously referred to as ‘padas or bastis’, that surround
these census villages have no access to grid electricity.

Further, on review of current number of unelectrified villages across various states, it is observed that the state
of Odisha has highest number of unelectrified villages. However, the village electrification rate is pegged at
81.6%. (Source- CEA)

6.2. Key Model Element
In light of the prevailing gap in rural
electrification and keeping a view the status                                    Clustering of
of rural household electricity consumption,                                       electrified,
                                                                               underelectrified
expanding the horizon of village                                               and unelectrified
electrification is being contemplated. The                                          villages
entire gamut for rural electrification must
include unelectrified village, under-electrified
village (grid available but absence of power                                   Under-electrified
supply) and cluster of electrified,
unelectrified and under-electrified villages.

Therefore, plans are being chalked out to
design and structure rural electrification
projects which feeds power to loads across a
cluster of villages which encompass
                                                                           Unelectrified
electrified, unelectrified and under-
electrified villages. In a bid to achieve this
objective, it is imperative to exploit the
available renewable potential, particularly
solar power and create generation assets
which are grid interactive and hence powering the unserved and under-served areas becomes possible.

Towards this, the host state utility in coordination with the state nodal agencies will identify such areas and
conduct a pre-feasibility analysis of setting up such projects. The pre-feasibility analysis shall entail
identification of the site and its solar resource assessment. Once it is established that results of the resource
assessment process are encouraging and that the conditions are conducive, then the host utility needs to
endeavour creating the grid network across the identified area by bringing such an area under its grid
augmentation plan. Following this, the utility in coordination with the state government will secure all the
clearances. Thereafter, these sites will be available for bidding to the private developer by adopting a suitable
project structure.

Since these projects are grid interactive, the procuring state power utilities will provide them a fixed tariff
which may be equivalent to the retail residential. The tariff taken for the sample analysis for this scheme is 4.50
INR kWh which is much below the prevailing solar tariffs discovered across various state bidding. In order to
make such projects financially viable, the central government will provide financial support in form of VGF
through capital subsidy. Adopting cluster approach for developing grid connected projects for rural
electrification has its own set of advantages which includes the following:

         On the technology side, small plants adequate for a single village lower the economic viability of the
          business. If the plants are made larger so that they can supply power to a few villages and hamlets, the
          projects are likely to be sustainable.

         Operation of economies of scale and it becomes financially viable to undertake a cluster level approach
          vis-a-vis setting up smaller projects of higher costs.
Proposed Approach for Rural Electrification through PPP in Renewable Energy




         With the increased size of such projects, the grid compatibility issue subsides in comparison to small
          scale projects which are not grid compatible. Also, technical standards for synchronisation of small
          systems with the grid at 400V are yet to be issued by the central electricity authority, hence posing a
          challenge for operation of small projects once they become grid interactive.

         These proposed solar projects will also help the distribution utility fulfil its solar RPO mandate.

         Monitoring and overseeing of cluster projects becomes easy and an inexpensive process.


6.3. Project Structuring of proposed Cluster level Grid
    Interactive RE projects for Rural Electrification
6.3.1. Adopting Transfer over Ownership model
Under the existing framework, for setting up of renewable energy power projects, the location gets notified and
specified by the SNA. However, the identification of sites for setting up the project is the responsibility of the
developer. The developer has the primary responsibility to of identify and secure clearances of the land. It will
be pertinent to mention that for setting solar and wind based projects, identification of the site and getting
prior clearance holds lot of importance. Hence this needs to be undertaken by a competent government
authority who will identify the site and secure all the necessary clearances. Under the transfer mode of the
project structuring, such nuances are being taken care by the government authority.

Under the ownership mode of the project operation for renewable energy, there is a common apprehension
among the lender community regarding the bankability of projects. In such cases, asset financing becomes a
predominant mode of financing while number of project financing cases are low. On other side, it has been
observed that if the legal ownership of renewable projects rests with the government, lenders are inclined to
finance such projects. In the transfer mode of project structuring, legal ownership of the project lies with the
government throughout the project life, before and after the concession period. Additionally, it will be
noteworthy to mention that under the ownership mode of project structuring, the onus of obtaining the
approvals of land and site clearance rests with the developer, and any delay in this regard might lead to a cost
over-run, thereby making the projects unbankable. On the other hand, if the responsibility of securing all
clearances lies with the government, then it will only increase the bankability of the project.

Further, since the objective of renewable projects is towards promoting an ecological sensitive as well as
sustainable development, these projects need to receive financial incentives from the government. Once these
projects are structured to be developed under the transfer mode, it becomes tenable to receive government
support vis-a-vis an ownership structured project which cannot receive any government support.

Therefore, it is suggested that renewable projects need to be developed through the transfer-based project
structuring.

6.3.2. Suitable Transfer variant for RE project development
Essentially, there are three different variants of the transfer model which are currently underway in the power
sector. This includes the build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT), build-own-maintain-transfer (BOMT) and
design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT). The BOMT model is being adopted in developing rural
electrification projects based on renewable energy projects. While BOMT, BOOT and DBFOT have their own
set of advantages, project structuring under the DBFOT mode has an edge over the others due to some of its
inherent aspects.

 The BOOT or BOMT model offers government grants a private entity to finance, design, build and operate a
facility for a specific period of time before the transfer. In both of these models, the ownership of assets rest
with the private party during the period of contract. However, after the end of contract period these assets are
Proposed Approach for Rural Electrification through PPP in Renewable Energy




transferred back to the government department or agency generally at the residual value. However, projects
which have been implemented under the BOOT or BOMT mode, particularly large hydropower projects, have
reportedly faced the lending risk since the ownership during the concession period rests with the developer who
has to procure the land as well as seek clearances from relevant authorities. However, under the DBFOT mode,
the government agency identifies the land and seeks clearances which make the projects more bankable from a
lender’s perspective. Lenders closely evaluate as well as appraise the projects based on RE technology, so a
suitable project structure is imperative. DBFOT is one such project structuring model which might evade the
financial risks surmounted to the project.

The BOMT or BOOT model suffers from another lacuna, specifically on their technical requirement which is
only limited to meet the desired output level at the procurer’s premises. Under the DBFOT model, the technical
requirements of the project specifically are granularly laid out and developer has to abide with it. In order to
keep a check over the technical specifications of the project, institutionalising an ‘independent engineer’ is a
requisite. Non-abidance of the desired technical specification leads to penalty on the developer. This feature is
desirable in context of developing RE projects since it has been frequently observed that developers are not
focussed towards the maintenance of the project leading to a high degree of deterioration of the plant.

In addition, invoking liquidity damages against projects is simpler in the case of DBFOT models, wherein the
government takes control of the assets in case of delay in implementation of the projects. However, experience
of the projects under the BOOT or BOMT model suggests that only monetary penalty can be imposed following
the delay in implementation of the project. In such a scenario, the developer might become uninterested in
completing the project on time.

Additionally, standardised practices under the DBFOT mode incentivises the project developer in
implementing the project before the scheduled date of commissioning. Developers get the unitary charges on
early commissioning and in some cases, an increase in the concession period.

6.3.3. Adopting DBFOT for RE based Rural Electrification based
      projects
6.3.3.1. Learnings from PPP structuring in conventional power ecosystem
Developing a conventional power ecosystem on the PPP basis has been a common and mature practice in
India. Projects spanning from generation- thermal, hydro to the distribution sector have been developed on the
basis of different PPP models. It will be imperative to understand the transformation of different PPP
Proposed Approach for Rural Electrification through PPP in Renewable Energy




structures that have been adopted for optimising resources to the fullest in case of thermal power projects.
With the advent of the Electricity Act,2003, the power generation business became a delicensed activity.
Different modes of developing power generation evolved and one such mode was the case-2 bidding route. The
envisaged development of the ultra mega power plant (UMPPs) is also being undertaken on the case-2 bidding
route. However, since the idea was conceived, there has been a transition in the PPP structuring of UMPPs.

The UMPP projects particularly at Sasan(MP), Mundra(Gujarat), Krishnapatnam(AP) and Tilaya(Jharkhand)
have been developed on the BOO basis. In case of these projects, the Power Finance Corporation (PFC), the
nodal agency for the UMPPs , formed the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with host state governments and
executed certain responsibilities of securing the necessary approvals and clearances such as the identification
and acquisition of land, pollution clearances, water linkage, level 1 environment clearance , securing fuel
linkage, etc. The SPV was eventually transferred to the successful bidder. Off-late, it has been observed that this
mode of project structuring suffered from a principal deficiency since this provided perpetual ownership to the
project developer. Further, acquisition of land, forest clearances by the private entity delayed the project
development.

In light of this consideration, the structuring of coal-based thermal power plants underwent a change when it
was contemplated that the development of upcoming projects will be undertaken based on the DBFOT mode.
Under this structuring option, the onus of securing land as well as obtaining all necessary clearances, including
environment, forest, section 164 etc will be obtained by the utility. Right of use of land for the purpose of
development, operation as well as maintenance of the project are licensed to the developer. At the end of the
concession period, the land along with project assets are transferred back to the utility in order to protect the
public resources such as fuel, land and water which will also revert to the utility.

Adopting the DBFOT variant in the renewable energy space will also provide an obligation to the host utility to
arrange the land for setting up of the project and provide immunity to the developer from the difficulties of
obtaining all the necessary clearances. However, it needs to be considered that under the DBFOT model,
assets transferred at the end of concession period will no longer render usefulness in operation, leading to
owning up of dysfunctional asset by the utility.

6.3.3.2. Removing deficiencies through DBFOT in RE based Rural
       Electrification Initiatives
In the present context, the renewable energy-based rural electrification initiative in the country is largely been
undertaken through decentralised distributed generation (DDG) projects in areas where the possibility of grid
penetration is not taking place over the next five years. Villages and hamlets not covered under the DDG
scheme is covered under the MNRE initiated through the Remote Village Electrification Programme. The
structures of both these initiatives are similar, with extension of the capital subsidy benefit to developers
under the enrolled initiative being the bedrock.

Project identification and seeking clearance

        Under the DDG scheme, the project developer has to submit a Detailed Project Report (DPR) while
         seeking the approval. For this purpose, the developer has to undertake a detailed survey of the
         proposed village or villages to choose the right technology and to assess the overall viability of the
         project. Although the guidelines allow the cost of preparing a DPR as part of the project cost while
         seeking financial assistance, developers maintain that it is a difficult process, even impractical, to
         expect a project developer to invest in conducting an in-depth field survey, an expensive proposition in
         terms of time and money, without any assurance that the project will be approved and in time.

        Also, the guidelines are vague on the role and responsibility for social engineering and obtaining the
         required clearances for the project site. This lack of clarity not only delays a project but also increases
         its costs and affects the cost-sharing mechanism.
Proposed Approach for Rural Electrification through PPP in Renewable Energy




           Although the guidelines lay down elaborate procedures for approving DDG projects and for
            implementing them, they are silent on the need to adhere to strict timelines in executing those
            procedures and taking decisions, and on fallback options in the event of delays. Such disregard for
            time-bound action results in delays in approving projects and in implementing them, leading to cost
            overruns.

           Under the DDG scheme, DPRs are channelled through the project implementing agency (PIA) to the
            REC and then to the implementation support group (ISG) for final approval, it takes a long time to get
            the approval. By that time the validity period of the tenders or bids floated on the basis of a preliminary
            DPR is usually over, leading to further revisions of time and costs.

   DBFOT provides a one-stop show for identification and securing clearance

              The power procuring utility identifies the site and secures all clearances required for the project.
               This provides visibility to project developer and gives him or her freedom from the difficulties of
               getting the clearance.
              The government conducts the pre-feasibility of the site to the extent of the nature of the project to
               be implemented and technology to be adopted.


Tariff setting and project financing

           Decentralised distributed generation is more of a government-driven and an operated mechanism. A
            90% capital subsidy, although intended to attract the private sector, actually limits the investment
            potential for the private sector developer significantly. Raising the remaining 10% as the state
            government’s share or as loan from the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), the implementing
            agency, or financial institutions limits the role of the private sector even further, thereby reducing it to
            that of a technology supplier.

           The DDG guidelines stipulate that the charges for providing power will be paid annually to the project
            developer by the implementing agency. The amount is expected to be paid out of the service charges or
            fees received by the implementing agency, which is fixed at 8% of the project cost for a state agency
            and 9% for CPSUs. The cap on service charges or fees to the state implementing agencies (8% of the
            project cost for state agencies and 9% for CPSUs) is likely to be inadequate in bridging the viability gap
            between the cost of providing power and revenue collection at the pre-determined tariff from users.

           At present, it is almost impossible for any RE-based DDG power plant to survive once grid power
            reaches the project site, mainly because tariffs for grid-supplied power are low. For consumers with low
            power consumption (in the case of multi-layered tariffs), for BPL households, and for categories such
            as agriculture, the tariffs are even lower. As a result, as soon as grid-supplied power is available,
            consumers prefer to switch to the grid and abandon the DDG project.

           If it is assumed that grid extension is inevitable in most parts of the country, the question that arises is
            that at what rate should a DDG project supply electricity to consumers and then to the grid once it is
            available? In order to ensure that the DDG project is viable, the guidelines recommend a fixed tariff
            based on the number of electric points or for each month, rather than that based on metered
            consumption. The guidelines also leave it to the implementing agency to devise ways for fixing these
            tariffs. However, once a plant is connected to the grid, these tariffs no longer apply and are replaced by
            those fixed by the state electricity regulatory commission, as is mandatory.

           Guidelines maintain that the viability gap needs to be bridged by using some amount from the service
            charges or fees paid to the implementing agency. However, whether such an arrangement will be
            honoured by the implementing agency, and honoured in time, is a moot question, which jeopardises
            profitable operation of a DDG plant.
Proposed Approach for Rural Electrification through PPP in Renewable Energy




    The DBFOT provides clarity to developers on the financing aspects of the project and
    provides concrete tariff setting mechanism.

                The financing terms are clear and as per the normative principles of grid connected projects
                 prescribed by the regulator.
                Tariff setting principles are as per the directives of the regulator and the applicable tariff for the
                 retail consumer in taken into consideration.
                In order to make the projects viable, the financial support is extended in the form of VGF through
                 capital subsidy.



Transfer issue

           According to the guidelines, DDG projects are to be owned by the state government and implemented
            on a BOMT basis. This model requires the project developer to maintain the power plant for five years
            and then transfer it to the state government, which means that the project developer runs the plant in
            the initial five years during which a plant usually experiences maximum problems, once its operation
            stabilises, the plant is transferred. This condition offers little motivation to the developer to resolve the
            teething problems adequately because that investment will bring in no returns. The same condition also
            prevents the developer from earning a profit after streamlining plant operations.

  The DBFOT provides clarity to the developers on the ownership of the project before and
  after the transfer of the asset.

               The developers are provided with the clarity that legal ownership of the project will rest with the
                government. Under the DBFOT model, the concession period is for the useful life wherein the
                project will be providing comfort to the lenders.


6.3.3.3. Other Perceived advantages
The DBFOT model offers another strategic advantage to the project developer and more specifically to the
project as whole. This can be corroborated from the fact that a developer gets incentivised for providing a
higher generation than the prescribed threshold level in the DBFOT model.

It would be noteworthy to mention that in the Indian conventional power eco-system and particularly in the
case-2 bidding for thermal power projects, the project developer is required to provide and seek approval for a
specific project design from the power procurer. Additionally, the developer is comforted by providing incentive
for attaining higher plant availability factor (PLF) over and above the prescribed threshold limit. This motivates
the developer to commission a highly efficient system in place which invariably meets the technical
specification and also helps in incentivising by achieving the higher PLF.

A counter view to this argument can also be presented wherein the installation of a highly efficient system
might lead to provisioning of higher capital cost leading to increase in tariff in order to meet a desired level of
return. However, this hypothesis gets discounted with the fact that with a higher generation in place, the cost of
generation will not increase leading to achievement of desired level of return without increase in tariff.

This also hold true for the renewable power projects where installation of the efficient designs needs to be
encouraged leading to higher optimisation of the resources and system. It will also lead to requirement of lower
support from the government, and thereby the developer becomes competitive in the bidding phase.

6.3.4. Elements of the proposed implementation structure for Rural
      Electrification
6.3.4.1. Roles and Responsibilities of the involved entities
In order to implement the proposed project for carrying out rural electrification, the DBFOT model has been
proposed. Three entities or parties are involved in the project which include the state utility (procurer of the
power), private developer developing the grid connected project for a cluster of villages and the central
government who in turn is providing
financial support to the project so as to
                                                                         Government of
make it more viable. The selected project                                     India
developer receives a concession to
finance, build, control, and operate a
facility for a limited period of time, after
which the responsibility for the facility is                                Involved
transferred to the government. The                                         entities in
                                                                               the

                                                                                           Prospective

while the public sector retains legal
ownership.

Under the proposed model, the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders, the project developer, utility
procuring the power as well as the government providing the financial support has to be clearly stated out.

Role of the project developer

         Procure appropriate proprietary rights, licences, agreements and permissions for materials, methods,
          processes, know-how and systems used for installing the power station.

         Perform and fulfil its obligations under the financing agreements.
Proposed Approach for Rural Electrification through PPP in Renewable Energy




         Ensure and procure that its contractors comply with all applicable permits and applicable laws in the
          performance by them of any of the project developer’s obligations.

         Comply with the provisions of applicable laws, particularly the respective state grid code with regard to
          metering of supply of electricity.

         Transfer the project assets to the utility upon termination of the concession agreement.

Role of the host utility

       Support the project developer in providing inter-connectivity to the project.

       Procurement of the power generated from the generating unit at a specified tariff level.

       Conduct the pre-feasibility of the site in coordination with the state nodal agency(SNA) with an
        objective to estimate the resource availability.

       Provide reasonable support and assistance to the project developer in procuring applicable permits,
        including site clearances, required from the government agency for implementation and operation of
        the project.

        Procure the assets at the end of the useful life.

Role of the government

       Providing financial support to the identified project in the form of VGF so that the SPD is able to
        achieve financial closure for the full amount if required at the time of signing of PPA.

       Conducting the bid process management process.

       Monitoring the operation of the awarded projects.

6.3.4.2. Perceived risks
The risks associated with PPP projects include pre-construction, construction, traffic and revenue, currency,
force majeure, political and financial. These must be addressed in a manner satisfactory to debt and equity
investors, before they commit to funding the project.

        Pre-construction risk: Ensuring environmental compliance and other project requirements in the
         pre-construction period may cause delays and cost overruns during project development. The private
         sector usually bears the risk of such delays that crop up in the pre-construction stage. The public
         sector, however, often takes responsibility for acquiring the right-of-way, environmental clearance, and
         any delay in getting these sanctions, may delay implementation.

        Construction risk: During the construction phase, design changes, unforeseen geological and
         weather conditions and the unavailability of materials and labour, can prompt delays and cost
         overruns. The private sector typically takes primary responsibility for cost overruns and delays during
         this period. However, renewable projects (projects undertaken in high-risk terrains such as mountains
         and rivers) that face substantial uncertainties during construction, may require the public sector to
         share the construction period risks to attract private partners.

        Power generation and revenue realisation risk: Power generation from renewable energy
         depends on the vagaries of nature and therefore its output cannot be accurately predicted. Solar
         resource data, computed from a 12-year solar cycle and projected over 25 years, is required to estimate
         the electricity generation potential of the site and to determine the economic feasibility of the project.
Proposed Approach for Rural Electrification through PPP in Renewable Energy




         The time spent in procuring the requisite certified data from technology providers, to accurately assess
         project feasibility and to secure performance guarantee, can cause project delays. Despite employing
         sophisticated techniques to forecast hourly solar irradiation using typical meteorological year (TMY),
         solar resource data may vary by 15% on a year-to-year basis. Consequently, any approach by the utility
         to penalise lower generation of electricity may be considered contrary to the principles of power
         generation through renewable sources and the generation or operation risk may come into play. This
         risk is essentially borne by the private developer.

         Additionally, during the generation periods of the solar projects, if the distribution utility is unable to
         draw power for any reason, owing to non-availability of an evacuation line, there is no provision for the
         deemed generation. Most commercial documents, particularly concerning PPA, recommends the
         delivery point at the state transmission ytility (STU) substation’s commercial metering point.
         Accordingly, the losses up to the metering point as well as the risk of curtailment due to non-availability
         of an evacuation line will have to be borne by the solar project developer. This risk is also borne by the
         private developer.

         I The responsibility of the final payment rests on the distribution utility. If the utility fails to make the
         payment, the risk of the default on the payment increases for the project developer. This makes the
         project un-bankable too.

        Political risk: Political risk involves government actions that could impair a private developer’s ability
         to generate earnings. Such actions include terminating concessions or imposing taxes or regulations on
         the project. This fall-out severely damages its value to investors; disallows private partners to charge
         and collect revenue as specified under the concession agreement; prevents investors from transferring
         earnings out of the country or prevents contract disputes to be settled fairly under a neutral
         jurisdiction.

        Financial risk: Financial risk is the risk that project cash flows may be insufficient to pay an adequate
         return on the private debt and equity invested in the project. This occurs due to the limited availability
         of the resource assessment data, which forms the basis for projecting future revenues. The second is the
         strength of public power purchasing agreements (PPAs) due to the weak financial health of the host
         utilities. The private sector bears the financial risk.

6.3.5. Incorporating best bidding practices
Section 10 of the Electricity Act, 2003, states that a generating company may supply electricity to any licensee
in accordance with the Act and rules and regulations made thereunder and may, subject to the regulations
made under sub-section (2) of section 42, supply electricity to any consumer. The National Tariff Policy (NTP),
formulated by the Ministry of Power, outlines specific guidelines for the purchase of tariff for power generated
from renewable energy sources.

Section 6.4 “…. It will take some time before non -conventional technologies can compete with conventional
sources in terms of cost of electricity. Therefore, procurement by distribution companies shall be done at
preferential tariffs determined by the appropriate commission.

Such procurement by distribution licensees for future requirements shall be done, as far as possible, through a
competitive bidding process under section 63 of the Act within suppliers offering energy from the same type of
non-conventional sources. In the long term, these technologies will need to compete with other sources in
terms of full costs.?

The MNRE issued the standard bidding guidelines for renewable power under the provisions of section 63 of
the Electricity Act, 2003, for the procurement of electricity by distribution licensees (procurer):

         Long-term procurement of electricity for a period of seven years and above

         Medium-term procurement for a period of up to seven years but exceeding one year

The standard bidding guidelines for the procurement of power through competitive bidding from renewable
power projects at a particular location has been classified as Case-2 bidding. Case-2 bidding route is a single-
staged process, wherein the request for proposal (RFP) is issued to the prospective bidder and responses of the
bidder are evaluated against the specified technical specifications and lowest cost of providing the power. The
time taken for completing the entire process from issuance of RFP to signing the PPA has been prescribed for
150 days.

The bidding of the solar projects under both phases of the JNNSM also culminated on a single-stage level. The
evaluation process of the bidding stage comprised the following two steps:

          Techno-commercial evaluation
Proposed Approach for Rural Electrification through PPP in Renewable Energy




         Financial bid (VGF requirement) evaluation


Based on the understanding that the total capacity of such projects will be in the range of 3-4MW, the single-
stage bidding process is adjudged as the most suitable. The government-appointed implementing agency issues
the request for selection (RFS) and calls for techno-commercial and financial bids from the prospective
developers. Evaluation of the techno-commercial bids takes place in compliance with the technical specification
provided in the RFS, while the financial bid is evaluated against the minimum financial support required from
the government. In this regard, the implementing agency will issue the standard PPA, site-specific project pre-
feasibility report and VGF securitisation agreement.




 Illustrative bidding process timeline

The PPA earmarks the standard roles and responsibilities of the parties involved. It also mentions ways to
incentivise the developer to pursue a higher availability of the plant. VGF securitisation agreement will lead to
creating security by way of charge in favour of the government on the assets of the proposed project.

7. Proposed financial model for a
   renewable energy based rural
   electrification PPP structure
A business model where a developer selling solar power directly to the discom, who in turn supplies power to
the villages for their basic needs, will require provision of support and incentives to the developer and/or the
discom.

7.1. Load estimation
For financial analysis, solar plant sizing was carried out on a cluster of villages based on an estimated household
load consisting of lighting (through LEDs), fans and electrical sockets for mobile charging and other small
appliances.

Equipment                 Quantity per           Load (kW)           Total Load

Given the estimated household load and taking into account a cluster of five villages with an average of 200
households each, the cluster load profile with eight hours of electricity is illustrated in the table.

                    -




Load Profile of village cluster



The estimated solar plant capacity required to cater to a cluster of villages with the above load profile has been
calculated to be around 400 kW. This has been estimated by considering a CUF of 19% and transmission losses
till the interconnection point of around 10%.
Proposed financial model for a renewable energy based rural electrification PPP structure




For the base case viability assessment, viability gap funding requirement has been estimated by keeping a
constant equity internal rate of return (IRR) at 16%. The model is based on a cost plus approach based on
assumptions with a support component in the form of VGF for an expected rate of return on the project. Other
support options including concessional loan, longer tenure loan, etc. will also be analysed to arrive at an
acceptable VGF requirement.

7.2. Financial analysis
The individual solar PV power project assumptions have been summarised in the table. They are in the drafting
stage, are indicative and can be modified as per different business models off-take and support arrangements.
Currently, financing for base case calculations have been done by taking a loan at an interest rate of 12% and
tenure of 12 years with a one-year moratorium.

The capital cost also includes the cost of storage through batteries. The expected return for the investor or
project developer has been fixed at an equity IRR of 16% to first calculate the required levelised tariff to achieve
the expected return.

With the current assumptions and expected return, the required tariff for the solar PV rural electrification
project without VGF is 7.80 INR per kWh. Since this is higher than the tariffs discovered in state solar policy
allocations, the VGF scenario has been developed with a fixed tariff of 4.50 INR per kWh (fixed to reduce the
burden on discoms). With this tariff and the above assumptions, at an equity IRR of 16% the required VGF is
13.18 million INR which is 47.3% of the total capital cost. The salvage value of the power plant after 25 years of
operation under the VGF option is Rs. 3.20 million INR. This value is the accounting salvage value of 10% of
fixed assets reduced by the amount of VGF paid and is given to the developer to sell.

7.2.1. Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivities have been run on the proposed solar PV rural electrification project, by changing the main inputs
including CUF, tariff, capital cost, storage and expected IRR. Tariff required for zero VGF has also been
estimated.

The capital cost varies due to change in interest during construction (IDC) as the level of VGF changes along
with amount of debt required. The first calculation row is the base case output. Based on the sensitivity
analysis, at a tariff of 7.80 INR per kWh, the VGF requirement is 0, to achieve an equity IRR of 16%. The VGF
requirement at a tariff of 5.5 INR per kWh is 9.22 million INR (32.90% of capex) with respect to the base case,
and is within the limit of 40% VGF. Therefore, tariff is a sensitive factor in the viability of solar PV projects.

Interest rate is a highly sensitive factor impacting the equity IRR and with a lower interest rate, the quantum of
VGF required decreases. With a 8% interest rate, a loan tenure of 15 years and a three-year moratorium period,
the VGF required is 35.20%.




7.3. Support required for pilot projects
In view of the high level of VGF required for the base case scenario, other incentives have been proposed to
reduce the amount of VGF required to make the project feasible. Some of the incentives assessed to calculate
the VGF include low-cost concessional loan, longer tenure loan and moratorium period, higher debt-equity
ratio or a combination of these incentives and support mechanisms.

Based on the VGF and financial analysis of the above cases, the VGF required as a percentage of capex is below
40% for the following cases-

    VGF as an incentive along with a debt equity ratio of 80:20, 50% debt from private domestic FIs at 12%
     interest rate and tenure of 12 years and a one year moratorium and rest 50% from multilaterals at 8% with
     15 years tenure and a moratorium of five years
    VGF as an incentive along with a debt equity ratio of 70:30, 100% debt from multilaterals at 8% interest
     rate and tenure of 15 years and a moratorium of five years
    VGF as an incentive along with a debt equity ratio of 80:20, 40% debt from private domestic FIs at 12%
     interest rate and tenure of 12 years and a moratorium of one year and rest 60% from multilaterals at 8%
     with 15 years tenure and a moratorium of five years
    VGF as an incentive along with a debt equity ratio of 70:30, 30% debt from private domestic FIs at 12%
     interest rate and tenure of 12 years and a moratorium of one year and rest 70% from multilaterals at 8%
     with 15 years tenure and a moratorium of five years
    VGF as an incentive along with a debt equity ratio of 80:20 and debt at 8% interest rate, a tenure of 15
     years and a moratorium of five years
    VGF as an incentive along with a debt equity ratio of 80:20, 40% debt from private domestic
     FIs at 12% interest rate and tenure of 12 years and a moratorium of two years and rest 60%
     from multilaterals at 8% with 15 years tenure and a moratorium of five years
    VGF as incentive along with a debt equity ratio of 80:20, 30% debt from private domestic FIs at 12%
     interest rate and tenure of 12 years and a moratorium of one year and rest 70% from multilaterals at 8%
     with 15 years tenure and a moratorium of five years


The lowest direct outflow for the government is in the scenario with VGF and a concessional multilateral or
bilateral loan facilitated by the government of 8% with 15 years of tenure and five years of additional
moratorium and a debt-equity ratio of 80:20 with a VGF of 7.38 million INR per project of 400 kW, i.e. 26.39%
of total project cost. This scenario, however limits the direct exposure of the developer to only 14.72% of the
total capital cost.

To increase the responsibility of financing for the developer and increase the developer’s commitment, the
scenario selected is with VGF as incentive with a D: E ratio of 80:20 and 40% debt from private domestic FIs at
12% interest rate and tenure of 12 years and two years moratorium and rest 60% from multilaterals at 8% with
15 years tenure and five years moratorium. This scenario requires a VGF of 34.68% of capex, i.e. 9.68 million
INR per project. The other sources of finance are private sector (33.97% of capex- 13.06% equity and 20.90%
debt) and 31.35% debt from multilateral or bilateral agencies facilitated by the government.

This level of VGF support is in line with the government constraints and can be achieved if part of the debt
funding can be raised by concessional loans from multilateral/ bilateral agencies at attractive terms including
8% interest rate, 15 year loan tenure and a moratorium of five years. To provide such a lower cost and long term
debt, the government along with foreign multilateral and bilateral agencies will need to leverage their funds to
create a pool of funds to lend to such projects.
Proposed financial model for a renewable energy based rural electrification PPP structure




Therefore, the suggested option that reduces the government outflow is scenario VIII. The main assumptions of
the suggested scenario are as follows:

   Capacity of sample project: 400 kW (solar PV technology)

   Villages covered: 5

   Households covered: 1000

   Capital cost: 27.92 million INR

   Tariff: 4.50 INR per kWh (fixed for entire project life)

   VGF required per 400 kW project: 9.68 million INR (34.68% of capital cost)

   Post VGF Debt: Equity Ratio: 80:20

   Post VGF funding sources:

   Equity (from developer) required per project: 3.65 million INR (20.0% of Post-VGF capital cost)

   Debt (from developer) required per project: 5.84 million INR (32.0% of Post VGF capital cost)

   Debt (from multilateral/ bilateral) required per project: 8.75 million INR (48.0% of Post VGF
   capital cost)

   Terms of domestic (developer) loan: interest rate- 12%, 12 years with additional two years of
   moratorium on principle

   Terms of multilateral/ bilateral loan: interest rate- 8%, 15 years with additional five years of
   moratorium on principle




7.4. Replicable potential and funds required for scheme
Rural electrification and its augmentation are important to bridge the rural-urban divide and improve the
quality of life in villages. Even now, more than 25,000 villages in India remain un-electrified. There are several
under-electrified and underserved villages without electricity or with insufficient electricity, even though a grid
is available. Electricity is now a basic necessity and is important to increase the level of economic activity across
such villages.

A clustered-village approach provides ample potential for developing renewable projects for rural electrification
and minimises the funds required from the government. This model also promotes private participation, which
helps tap vast private funds for this purpose.

This model should first be done on a pilot basis, covering the most un-electrified regions in India, and then
ramped up. The table captures the top five states—Odisha, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Bihar and Arunachal
Pradesh—as per the number of un-electrified villages (source CEA).

State                                             No. of un-electrified villages
Odisha                                            8756
Rajasthan                                         4212
Proposed financial model for a renewable energy based rural electrification PPP structure




Jharkhand                                         2279
Bihar                                             1757
Arunachal Pradesh                                 1613


Twenty such projects can be taken up on an experimental basis in these states, which have the highest number
of un-electrified villages in the country. The fund, a VGF required from the government to undertake a pilot
programme for 20 such sites is approximately 190 million to 250 million INR (19 crore to 25 crore INR). Apart
from the VGF, the quantum of concessional multilateral or bilateral loan required is 175 million to 225 million
INR (17.5 crore to 22.5 crore INR). The fund requirement may change as the financial analysis and funding is
based on load estimation of a sample village of 200 households.

7.5. Zero VGF case
To limit the direct government funds outflow, scenarios based on benefits such as concessional loans and
escalated tariff have been proposed. To implement such a project, policy and regulatory interventions allowing
tariff escalation are required. Lower cost funding from foreign and domestic sources is also essential.

Proposed financial model for a renewable energy based rural electrification PPP structure




These scenarios require no VGF or subsidy support, but require a tariff escalation structure along with a low-
cost funding option. However, such a structure may not be suitable at the village level and may cause discoms to
renege on such higher tariffs and increase project risk.
Way Forward




8. Way Forward
8.1. Recommendations
It has been endeavored to put across certain recommendations for government interventions to support and
promote renewable projects on such approach.:

Functional Recommendations:

       To date, over 25000 villages remain un-electrified in the country along with the presence of plenty
        under-electrified villages where grid is available but there is no power. Also, with the increase in the
        electrified villages, economic activity across such villages increases which creates the demand for
        additional power. This structure provides an ample potential for developing renewable projects on the
        clustering approach by adopting suitable project structure. Government should pronounce a policy
        apparatus considering these un-electrified areas which could be energized by renewable energy
        projects- particularly solar.

       The annual energy supply position in FY 14 revealed a deficit of 4.2%. This shows that there is shortage
        of electricity in the country which can be plugged by augmenting generation assets. Encouraging small
        scale grid interactive renewable projects would be one such step towards mitigating the energy gap.
        Also, this will lead to reduction of the line losses once it becomes grid connected following the transfer
        of assets since the power generating assets would be near to the load center.


Operational Recommendations:

       With regards to transfer of the assets at the end of the useful life to the utility under the proposed
        model, it is recommended that the transfer of the assets should be done to state government. It should
        be the sole discretion of the state government to decide the end state government owned entity of the
        transferred assets.

              o   Owing to the fact that the assets gets transferred back at the end of the useful life i.e. normally
                  the concession period, the host distribution utility should be equipped with the skill set to
                  operate the generating assets. The best illustration in this regard would be learning to operate
                  the DDG assets which have come up for rural electrification. This may enable the distribution
                  utility to handle the transferred assets at the end of concession period.

              o   Generation companies owe the expertise to handle the power projects but face the limitation
                  on handling small scale distributed generation assets. However, impetus on capacity building
                  for generating projects should be provided in order to enable them in handling projects of such
                  nature.

       Following the transfer of the assets at the end of the concession period, it must be endeavored need to
        take on distribution on behalf of DISCOMs instead of confining themselves to generating power .
        Therefore, we believe that project developer may also undertake metering, billing, and collection
        (MBC) on behalf of the DISCOM within a given cluster under the franchisee mode. This would keep the
        commercial interest of the developer intact.

       In order to ensure that deterioration of project does not take place and plant gets transferred at the end
        of concession period with high operational capability, an ‘Independent Engineer’ must be instituted
        who inspects the operation of the plant at regular interval .
Way Forward




Technical and Regulatory Requirements

       Strong contractual arrangement for both generation and distribution with appropriate regulatory
        oversight under 8th Proviso of Section 14 of Electricity Act should be provided.

       Proper inter- connectivity standards should be pronounced by CEA to formalize the smooth operation
        of such projects

Financial Recommendations:

       In order to attract investors for developing projects under this model, transparent bidding process
        needs to be adopted in order to discover the suitable ‘cost’. All such discovered cost shoul d be project
        specific wherein developer should be provided with the comfort by providing the government
        incentives.

        Bidding of the projects could be in form of minimum tariff or the minimum capital cost subsidy
        required from government.

       Longer tenure loans should be extended to such projects to reduce the requirement of government
        fund and for increase replication.

       Multilateral/Bilateral institutions should be evinced to provide financial support to such projects
        wherein low cost loans could be provided in order to enhance the financial viability of the project.

       Possible avenues for securing the support includes:
            o Viability Gap Funding
            o Re-finance scheme initiated by IREDA

Location        Cape Verde
Stakeholders Cabeólica, S.A. is a Cape Verdean company created in 2009. It is based on a Public-
                Private-Partnership (PPP) established in 2008 between InfraCo Limited, a privately
                managed donor-funded infrastructure development company, the Government of Cape
                Verde (Ministry of Tourism, Industry and Energy) and Electra, S.A.R.L., the local
                utility company.
                The PPP administers the development, financing, construction, ownership and
                operation of four wind farms in Cape Verde, with a total installed capacity of 25.5 MW,
                distributed throughout the islands of Santiago (9.35 MW), São Vicente (5.95 MW), Sal
                (7.65 MW) and Boa Vista (2.55 MW).
Structure       Infra Co developed the project under the BOO mode and signed PPA with Electra. The
                operation and maintenance contract was provided to Vestas .

                  equity-debt ratio. The PPP had a key role in establishing the financing by facilitating
                  the long-term PPA with Electra, and by providing the supporting guarantees and tax
                  exemptions.
                 InfraCo Limited, as the main developer of the project, created the dynamics behind
                  the financial project by identifying investors to take the risk of investment and
                  assuming a shareholding position, as well as, identifying international financial
                  institutions to assume the financing.
                 The main investors (Africa Finance Corporation; Finnish Fund for Industrial
                  Cooperation and InfraCo Limited) invested roughly € 20 million.

                   was signed between DMRC and the developer.

                        This is the largest roof top plant with such capacity in Delhi NCR region under the RESCO
                        model. As per the model for the roof-top plant, the developer invests, owns and operates

8. Oakland International Airport (OAK)
Project           Oakland International Airport (OAK)
Location          Oakland, USA
Stakeholders      Oakland International Airport (OAK), SunEdison
Description       The Port of Oakland, which owns and operates Oakland International Airport (OAK), is
                  also a municipal utility that purchases electricity from the wholesale market for its own use.
                  Its governing body set up a target to obtain at least 20% of its electricity from renewable
                  sources, utilising open area within certain aircraft safety zones that can support a low
                  ground-mounted solar energy system.

                        At the time this project began, there were existing solar energy companies who would sell
                        their power to the Port, however, at three times what it paid for conventional power. An
                        alternative for the Port was to build its own solar energy generating facility, but it did not
                        have sufficient capital funds to finance the project. Instead the Port was able to secure a
                        US$ 2.9 million rebate from the local investor-owned utility in 2006 for a 1 MW solar
                        energy generation system on the Port’s property. That made it possible for the Port of
                        Oakland to seek a public-private partnership.

                        The Port of Oakland is a non-taxpaying public entity. Therefore it cannot benefit from
                        available energy tax incentives and rapid depreciation schedules. Instead the Port took an
                        innovative approach and chose to work with a private partner that could benefit from the
                        tax and depreciation incentives. Terms of this 20-year agreement requires SunEdison to
                        design, build, finance, own, operate and maintain a solar energy system on Port property
                        and for the Port to buy all of the solar energy that this system produces at prices stated in
                        the PPA. The Port also has the option to purchase the facility after five years of operation.

                            The consortium of SHARP, Ital Thai Development and Ital Thai Engineering was
                            contracted to provide engineering, procurement and construction services within an 18-
                            month long construction schedule.

                            solar farm. Power off-taker is Provincial Electricity Authority via a 5-year automatically
                            renewable PPA, structured under the Thai Government’s Small Power Producer (“SPP?)
                            Program.

                            Over THB5 billion of project debt was funded by Asia Development Bank, Bangkok
                            Bank, Siam Commercial Bank and Kasikorn Bank under a non-recourse project

                            The plant has signed long-term power purchasing agreements to sell power to the
                            Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand and an additional 5 MW to the Provincial
                            Electricity Authority at a fixed rate of B8 per kWh in addition to the wholesale tariff for
                            the first 10 years of operations.

                            Government is not an owner of the Project Company and thus is not directly involved in
                            Project governance or management However, Government plays a critical role in acting
                            as Offtaker, administering the SPP Program, and providing tax concessions and
                            incentives(through the Thai Board of Investment).

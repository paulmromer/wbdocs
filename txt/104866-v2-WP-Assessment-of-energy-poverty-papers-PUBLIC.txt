This paper investigates the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth
and energy consumption and employment in Pakistan. By applying techniques of co-integration and
Hsiao’s version of Granger causality, the results infer that economic growth causes total energy
consumption. Economic growth also leads to growth in petroleum consumption, while on the other
hand, neither economic growth nor gas consumption affect each other. However, in the power
sector it has been found that electricity consumption leads to economic growth without feedback.
The implications of the study are that energy conservation policy regarding petroleum consumption
would not lead to any side-effects on economic growth in Pakistan. However, an energy growth
policy in the case of gas and electricity consumption should be adopted in such a way that it
stimulates growth in the economy and thus expands employment opportunities.


In the present paper, an attempt is made to examine the causal relationship between the per capita
consumption of coal, electricity, oil and total commercial energy and the per capita real gross
domestic product (GDP), using a co-integration and vector error correction model. The increase in
real GDP, among other things, indicates a higher demand for a large quantity of commercial energy
such as coal, oil and electricity. This implies that low infrastructure development limits the usage of
commercial energy, which may also hold back economic growth. Empirical findings reveal that there
is a unidirectional causality running from coal, oil and commercial energy consumption to per capita
real GDP, whereas a unidirectional causality running from per capita real GDP to per capita
electricity consumption is found. It is suggested that the input of per capita energy consumption
stimulates enhanced economic growth in Nepal.

In this paper, the energy-GDP relationship (in per capita terms) is analyzed for a sample of 16
countries, over the time period 1950-51 to 1984-85. Co-integration theory is first used to test
whether a long-run equilibrium relation exists between the two variables. After co-integration has
been established, causality measures are constructed to quantify various types of feedback between
energy and GDP for each country. It is then examined whether the causality measures are
longitudinally related to certain basic economic indicators of the countries in the sample.
Unlike previous studies on the casual relationship between energy consumption and economic
growth, this paper illustrates how the finding of cointegration (i.e. long-term equilibrium
relationship) between these variables, may be used in testing Granger causality. Based on the most
recent Johansen’s multiple cointegration tests preceded by various unit root or nonstationarity
tests, we test for cointegration between total energy consumption, real income and price level of
two Asian LDCs: Thailand and Sri Lanka. Nonrejection of cointegration between variables rules out
Granger noncausality and implies at least one way of Granger-causality either unidirectional or
bidirectional. Secondly, by using a dynamic vector error-correction model, we then analyse the
direction of Granger-causation and hence the within-sample Grangerexogeneity or endogeneity of
each of the variables. Thirdly, the relative strength of the causality is gauged (through the dynamic
variance decomposition technique) by decomposing the total impact of an unanticipated shock to
each of the variables beyond the sample period, into proportions attributable to shocks in the other
variables including its own, in the multivariate system. Finally, these response paths of shocks to the
system are traced out using impulse response graphs. Results based on these four tools of
methodology, broadly indicate that all three variables are cointegrated and exhibit two common
trends within each system. Energy consumption seems to be relatively exogenous as neither income
nor prices seems to Granger cause this variable via any of the channels where potential casuality
may occur. Though, energy consumption itself plays an important role in in¯ uencing income and
prices by varying degrees of signi® cance for each country. Overall, shocks to the system seemed to
have had a more sustained if not pronounced e€     ect in Thailand than in Sri Lanka.


Applying recently developed techniques of cointegration and Hsiao's version of Granger causality to
three Latin countries (Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela), this study finds no causal linkages between
energy consumption and economic growth for both Mexico and Venezuela using the trivariate
models. However, capital is found to negatively, though weakly, cause economic growth for both
Mexico and Venezuela. Additionally, energy is found to cause economic growth for Brazil. In sum,
we detect no consistent causal patterns between energy and economic growth based on the
causality tests from the three Latin countries.

We investigate the causal relationship between GDP and different types of energy consumption for
the five South Asian Countries; Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal by using Error
Correction Model and Toda and Yamamoto(1995) approach. For Pakistan evidence shows that there
is unidirectional Granger causality running from coal to GDP, and unidirectional Granger causality
running from GDP to electricity consumption and total energy consumption. For India no causality in
either direction between GDP and different energy consumption is detected. For Sri Lanka there is
unidirectional Granger causality running from GDP to electricity consumption and total energy
consumption. For Bangladesh unidirectional Granger causality is detected from GDP to electricity
consumption and from gas consumption to GDP. For Nepal causal direction is from petroleum to
GDP.
This paper presents a model to quantify the impact of electric power outages on GDP by using
Cobb– Douglas production function to develop an economic relationship between the reliability of
the electric power supply system and the cost of electric energy unserved. Our findings show that
average costs for providing a stable power supply are much lower than disruption costs, which is
supported by recurring to the data available of Shanghai. Estimated by using Shanghai’s
macroeconomic data of 1990–2006, this relationship indicates that the impact of electricity service
disruption on Shanghai’s GDP is about 48.18 108 CNY in 2006, matching an alternative ‘‘back-of-
envelope? estimate of 50.91 108 CNY. The estimated costs per kWh unserved are 1.81–10.26 CNY
in 1990–2006, mirroring the increasing importance of electricity in the period’s economic
development. These results demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for quantifying the
reliability benefits of investments in electricity infrastructure.


This paper investigates the existence and direction of Granger causality between economic growth,
energy consumption, and carbon emissions in China, applying a multivariate model of economic
growth, energy use, carbon emissions, capital and urban population. Empirical results for China over
the period 1960–2007 suggest a unidirectional Granger causality running from GDP to energy
consumption, and a unidirectional Granger causality running from energy consumption to carbon
emissions in the long run. Evidence shows that neither carbon emissions nor energy consumption
leads economic growth. Therefore, the government of China can purse conservative energy policy
and carbon emissions reduction policy in the long run without impeding economic growth.


This paper investigates the long run Granger causality relationship between economic growth,
carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption in Turkey, controlling for gross fixed capital
formation and labor. The most interesting result is that carbon emissions seem to Granger cause
energy consumption, but the reverse is not true. The lack of a long run causal link between income
and emissions may be implying that to reduce carbon emissions, Turkey does not have to forgo
economic growth.


This paper uses the panel data of energy consumption and GDP for 82 countries from 1972 to 2002.
Based on the income levels defined by the World Bank, the data are divided into four categories:
low income group, lower middle income group, upper middle income group, and high income group.
We employ the GMM-SYS approach for the estimation of the panel VAR
model in each of the four groups. Afterwards, the causal relationship between energy consumption
and economic growth is tested and ascertained. We discover: (a) in the low income group, there
exists no causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth; (b) in the middle
income groups (lower and upper middle income groups), economic growth leads energy
consumption positively; (c) in the high income group countries, economic growth leads energy
consumption negatively. After further in-depth analysis of energy related data, the results indicate
that, in the high income group, there is a great environmental improvement as a result of more
efficient energy use and reduction in the release of CO2. However, in the upper middle income
group countries, after the energy crisis, the energy efficiency declines and the release of CO2 rises.
Since there is no evidence indicating that energy consumption leads economic growth in any of the
four income groups, a stronger energy conservation policy should be pursued in all countries.
In this paper, we analyse the long-run relationship between energy consumption and real GDP for
93 countries. We find mixed results on the impact of energy consumption on real GDP, with greater
evidence at the country level supporting energy consumption having a negative causal effect on real
GDP. For the G6 panel of countries, we find significant evidence that energy consumption negatively
Granger causes real GDP. This means that for countries where energy consumption has a negative
long- run causal effect on real GDP, energy conversation policies should not retard economic
growth. We identify these countries and regional panels. We argue that these countries/regions
should play a greater role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions.


This paper provides a survey of the recent progress in the literature of energy consumption -
economic growth and electricity consumption - economic growth causality nexus. The survey
highlights that most empirical studies focus on either testing the role of energy (electricity) in
stimulating economic growth or examining the direction of causality between these two variables.
Althought the positive role of energy on growth has become a stylized fact, there are some
methodological reservations about the results from these empirical studies. A general observation
from these studies is that the literature produced conflicting results and there is no consensus
neither on the existence nor on the direction of causality between energy consumption (electricity
consumption) and economic growth. As a policy implication, to avoid from conflicting and unreliable
results, the authors may use the autoregressive distributed lags bounds test, two-regime threshold
co-integration models, panel data approach and multivariate models including new variables (such
as: real gross fixed capital formation, labor force, carbon dioxide emissions, population, exchange
rates, interest rates, etc.) Thus, the authors should focus more on the new approaches and
perspectives rather than by employing usual methods based on a set of common variables for
different countries and different intervals of time.


This paper reexamines the causality between GNP and energy consumption by using updated US
data for the period 1947-1979. As a secondary contribution, we investigate the causal relationship
between energy consumption and employment. Applying Sims’ technique, we ftnd no causal
relationship between GNP and energy consumption. We find further that there is a slight
unidirectional flow running from employment to energy consumption. Economic interpretations of
the empirical results are also presented.

This study examines the relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth in
Jamaica during 1970-86, a period of rapid increase in energy prices. The results show that the
aggregate demand for electricity is slightly income elastic, electricity has a signtjicant impact on
economic growth, the electricity intensity has increased over time, residential demand is fairly
income elastic, commercial demand is price inelastic, and the rate of adjustment is slow. These
results suggest that conservation policies could be ineflective. Therefore, indigenous sources of
electricity are important for Jamaica to be less dependent on imported energy.
This paper examines the causal relationship between GDP and energy use for the period 1947-90 in
the USA. The relationship between energy use and economic growth has been examined by both
biophysical and neoclassical economists. In particular, several studies have tested for the presence
of a causal relationship (in the Granger sense> between energy use andeconomic growth. However,
these tests do not allow a direct test of the relative explanatory powers of the neoclassical and
biophysica2 models. A multivariate adaptation of the test-vector autoregression ( VAR) does allow
such a test. A VAR of GDP, energy use, capital stock and employment is estimated and Granger tests
for causal relationships between the variables are carried out. Although there is no evidence that
gross energy use Granger causes GDP, a measure ofjinal energy use adjustedfor changing fuel
composition does Granger cause GDP.


Unlike previous studies on the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic
growth, this paper illustrates how the finding of cointegration (i.e. long-term equilibrium
relationship) between these variables, may be used in testing Granger causality. Based on the most
recent Johansen's multivariate cointegration tests preceded by various unit root or non-stationarity
tests, we test for cointegration between total energy consumption and real income of six Asian
economies: India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. Non-rejection of
cointegration between variables rules out Granger non-causality and imples at least one way of
Granger-causality, either unidirectional or bidirectionial. Secondly, by using a dynamic vector error-
correction model, we then analyse the direction of Granger-causation and hence the within-sample
Granger-exogeneity or endogeneity of each of the variables. Thirdly, the relative strength of the
causality is gauged (through the dynamic variance decomposition technique) by decomposing the
total impact of an unanticipated shock to each of the variables beyond the sample period, into
proportions attributable to shocks in the other variables including its own, in the bivariate system.
Results based on these tools of methodology indicate that while all pair-wise relationships shared
common univariate integrational properties, only relationships for three countries (India, Pakistan
and Indonesia) were cointegrated. For these countries, temporal causality results were mixed with
unidirectional causality from energy to income for India, exactly the reverse for Indonesia, and
mutual causality for Pakistan. The VDCs were not inconsistent with these results and provided us
with an additional insight as to the relatively more dominant direction of causation in Pakistan.
Simple bivariate vector-autoregressive models for the three non-cointegrated systems did not
indicate any direction of causality, significantly in either direction.


Applying Hsiao's version of the Granger causality method, this paper examines the causality
between energy and GNP and energy and employment by applying recently developed techniques
of co-integration and Hsiao's version of the Granger causality to Taiwanese data for the 1955-1993
period. The Phillips-Perron tests reveal that the series with the exception of GNP are not stationary
and therefore differencing is performed to secure stationarity. The study finds causality running
from GDP to energy consumption without feedback in Taiwan. It is also found that causality runs
from GDP to energy but not vice versa.
This paper extends my previous analysis of the causal relationship of GDP and energy use in the USA
in the post-war period. A majority of the relevant variables are integrated justifying a cointegration
analysis. The results show that cointegration does occur and that energy input cannot be excluded
from the cointegration space. The results are plausible in terms of macroeconomic dynamics. The
results are similar to my previous Granger causality results and contradict claims in the literature
based on bivariate models. that there is no cointegration between energy and output.

This paper estimates the causal relationships between energy consumption and income for India,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, using cointegration and error-correction modelling
techniques. The results indicate that, in the short-run, unidirectional Granger causality runs from
energy to income for India and Indonesia, while bidirectional Granger causality runs from energy to
income for Thailand and the Philippines. In the case of Thailand and the Philippines, energy, income
and prices are mutually causal. The study results do not support the view that energy and income
are neutral with respect to each other, with the exception of Indonesia and India where neutrality is
observed in the short-run.

This paper re-examines the causality between energy consumption and GDP by using updated
Taiwan data for the period 1954]1997. As a secondary contribution, we investigate the causal
relationship between GDP and the aggregate as well as several disaggregate categories of energy
consumption, including coal, oil, natural gas, and electricity. Applying Granger’s technique, we find
bidirectional causality between total energy consumption and GDP. We find further that different
directions of cause exist between GDP and various kinds of energy consumption.

This paper attempts to shed light into the empirical relationship between energy consumption and
economic growth, for Greece Ž1960 1996. employing the vector error-correction model estimation.
The vector specification includes energy consumption, real GDP and price developments, the latter
taken to represent a measure of economic efficiency. The empirical evidence suggests that there is a
long-run relationship between the three variables, supporting the endogeneity of energy
consumption and real output. These findings have important policy implications, since the adoption
of suitable structural policies aiming at improving economic efficiency can induce energy
conservation without impeding economic growth.

Results of this paper indicate that the real oil price is a major determinant of real national income
and energy consumption. The combined effects of real money and real government expenditure on
real income and energy consumption are also substantial. A lack of causality or the causality
between energy and real income in prior studies is due to the omitted variables. Results also
confirm that the two oil price shocks combined adversely affected real national income.

The causality relationship between energy consumption and income is a well-studied topic in energy
economics. This paper studies the time series properties of energy consumption and GDP and
reexamines the causality relationship between the two series in the top 10 emerging markets
excluding China due to lack of data and G-7 countries. We discover bi-directional causality in
Argentina, causality running from GDP to energy consumption in Italy and Korea, and from energy
consumption to GDP in Turkey, France, Germany and Japan. Hence, energy conservation may harm
economic growth in the last four countries.
The Granger-causality (GC) and error correction (ECM) techniques were applied on 1970–1999 data
for Malawi to examine cointegration and causality between electricity consumption (kWh) and,
respectively, overall GDP, agricultural-GDP (AGDP) and nonagricultural- GDP (NGDP). Cointegration
was established between kWh and, respectively, GDP and NGDP, but not with AGDP. The GC results
detect bi-directional causality between kWh and GDP suggesting that kWh and GDP are jointly
determined, but one-way causality running from NGDP to kWh. The ECM results detect causality
running one-way from GDP (also from NGDP) to kWh suggesting that a permanent rise in GDP may
cause a permanent growth in electricity consumption.

Yang (Energy Econ. 22 (2000) 309) has found a bi-directional causal relationship between gross
domestic product and electricity consumption in Taiwan, ROC. This study applies Yang’s model to
examine the impact of electricity supply on economic growth in Sri Lanka. Morimoto and Hope (An
extended CBA model of hydro projects in Sri Lanka (2001)) have found that the expected increase in
economic output due to increased electricity supply (parameter EO) plays a crucial role in their cost
benefit analysis model. This study shows that the application of Yang’s regression analysis is one
possible approach to estimate a better range for the parameter EO. The estimated figure is that an
extra output of Rs. 88 000– 137 000 ($US1120–1740) for every 1 MW h increase in electricity
supply.

Using a neo-classical one-sector aggregate production technology where capital, labor and energy
are treated as separate inputs, this paper develops a vector error-correction (VEC) model to test for
the existence and direction of causality between output growth and energy use in Canada. Using the
Johansen cointegration technique, the empirical findings indicate that the long-run movements of
output, labor, capital and energy use in Canada are related by two cointegrating vectors. Then using
a VEC specification, the short-run dynamics of the variables indicate that Granger-causality is
running in both directions between output growth and energy use. Hence, an important policy
implication of the analysis is that energy can be considered as a limiting factor to output growth in
Canada.

This note examines the different direction of causal relation between energy consumption and
economic growth in India. Applying Engle–Granger cointegration approach combined with the
standard Granger causality test on Indian data for the period 1950–1996, we find that bi-directional
causality exists between energy consumption and economic growth. Further, we apply Johansen
multivariate cointegration technique on the different set of variables. The same direction of
causality exists between energy consumption and economic growth. This is different from the
results obtained in earlier studies.

Causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is investigated applying a
multivariate model ofcapital, labor, energy and GDP. Usual BTU energy aggregate is substituted with
a Divisia aggregate in an attempt to mitigate aggregation bias. To test for Granger causality in the
presence ofcointegration among the variables, we employ a vector error correction model rather
than a vector autoregressive model. Empirical results for Korea over the period 1970–1999 suggest
a long run bidirectional causal relationship between energy and GDP, and short run unidirectional
causality running from energy to GDP. The source ofcausation in the long run is found to be the
error correction terms in both directions.
This paper investigates the causal relationship between various kinds of industrial energy
consumption and GDPin Shanghai for the period 1952–1999 using a modified version of the Granger
(1969) causality test proposed by Toda and Yamamoto (J. Econ. 66 (1995) 225). The empirical
evidence from disaggregated energy series seems to suggest that there was a uni-directional
Granger causality running from coal, coke, electricity and total energy consumption to real GDPbut
no Granger causality running in any direction between oil consumption and real GDP.

This paper tries to investigate a series of unit root and causality tests to detect causality between
the GDP and energy consumption in Turkey employing Hsiao’s version of Granger causality method
for the 1950–2000 period. The conventional unit root tests indicate the series are I(1), whereas the
endogenous break unit root tests proposed by Zivot and Andrews [Zivot, E. and Andrews, D.W.K.,
1992, Further evidence on the great crash, the oil price shock, and the unit root hypothesis, Journal
of Business and Economics Statistics 10, 251–270.] and Perron [Perron, P., 1997, Further evidence
on breaking trend functions in macroeconomic variables, Journal of Econometrics 80, 355–385.]
reveal that the series are trend stationary with a structural break. Therefore, it is inappropriate to
take the first difference of the data to achieve stationarity. The main conclusion of this study is that
there is no evidence of causality between energy consumption and GDP in Turkey based on the
detrended data.

This study investigates the causal relationship between electricity consumption and real GDP in
Turkey during the period of 1950–2000. Both of the series were found to be a stationary process
around a structural break by the Zivot and Andrews test. Thus, two different methodologies have
been employed to test the Granger non-causality: the Dolado–Lu¨tkepohl test using the VARs in
levels, and the standard Granger causality test using the detrended data. Both tests have yielded a
strong evidence for unidirectional causality running from the electricity consumption to the income.
This implies that the supply of electricity is vitally important to meet the growing electricity
consumption, hence to sustain the economic growth in Turkey.

In this paper we re-investigate the co-movement and the causality relationship between energy
consumption and GDP in 18 developing countries, using data for the period 1975 to 2001. Recently
developed tests for the panel unit root, heterogeneous panel cointegration, and panel-based error
correction models are employed. The empirical results provide clear support of a long-run
cointegration relationship after allowing for the heterogeneous country effect. The long-run
relationship is estimated using a full-modified OLS. The evidence shows that long-run and short-run
causalities run from energy consumption to GDP, but not vice versa. This result indicates that energy
conservation may harm economic growth in developing countries regardless of being transitory or
permanent.
This paper studies the stability between energy consumption and GDP for Taiwan during
1954–2003. We use aggregate as well as various disaggregate data of energy consumption, including
coal, oil, gas, and electricity, to employ the unit root tests and the cointegration tests allowing for
structural breaks. Our main findings are: First, though gas consumption seems to have structural
breaks in the 1960s, after considering the structural breaks, the series is a stationary variable when
Taiwan adopted its expansionary export trade policy. Second, we find that different directions of
causality exist between GDP and various kinds of energy consumption. The empirical result shows
unanimously in the long run that energy acts as an engine of economic growth, and that energy
conservation may harm economic growth. Third, the cointegration between energy consumption
and GDP is unstable, and some economic events may affect the stability. Overall, we do find the
structural breakpoints, and they look to match clearly with the corresponding critical economic
incidents.


The paper presents the first empirical analysis of electricity consumption in Cyprus. Using annual
data from 1960 to 2004, we have examined electricity use in the residential and the services
sectors, which are the fastest-growing electricity consumers in the island, and its interaction with
income, prices and the weather. The analysis was performed with the aid of time series analysis
techniques such as unit root tests with and without a structural break in levels, cointegration tests,
Vector Error Correction models, Granger causality tests and impulse response functions. Results
show long-term elasticities of electricity use above unity for income, and of the order of −0.3 to −0.4
for prices. In the short-term electricity consumption is rather inelastic, mostly affected by weather
fluctuations. Granger causality tests confirm exogeneity of electricity prices and bidirectional
causality between residential electricity consumption and private income. The commercial sector is
less elastic and reverts faster to equilibrium than the residential sector. Despite the relatively small
sample size, results reported here are quite robust and can be used for forecasts and policy
analyses.


This paper investigates the relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth for
OPEC members. The bounds test yields evidence of a long-run relationship between electricity
consumption and economic growth for all OPEC members. Causality results suggest that economic
growth is dependent on electricity consumption in five countries, less dependent in three countries,
and independent in three countries. Because these countries do not necessarily share similar
political and economic traits, no single universal policy implication can be inferred from the results.
The disparities across these causality results, therefore, stress the importance of formulating
causality explanations while taking into account the particularities of individual countries rather
than blindly applying the conventional interpretations.
Fiji is a small open island economy dependent on energy for its growth and development; hence, the
relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is crucial for Fiji's development. In
this paper, we investigate the nexus between electricity consumption and economic growth for Fiji
within a multivariate framework through including the labour force variable. We use the bounds
testing approach to cointegration and find that electricity consumption, GDP and labour force are
only cointegrated when GDP is the endogenous variable. We use the Granger causality F-test and
find that in the long-run causality runs from electricity consumption and labour force to GDP,
implying that Fiji is an energy dependent country and thus energy conservation policies will have an
adverse effect on Fiji's economic growth.


This paper applies the cointegration theory to examine the causal relationship between electricity
consumption and real GDP (Gross Demostic Product) for China during 1978–2004. Our estimation
results indicate that real GDP and electricity consumption for China are cointegrated and there is
only unidirectional Granger causality running from electricity consumption to real GDP but not the
vice versa. Then Hodrick–Prescott (HP) filter is applied to decompose the trend and fluctuation
component of the GDP and electricity consumption series. The estimation results indicate that there
is cointegration between not only the trend components, but also the cyclical components of the
two series, which implies that, the Granger causality is probably related with the business cycle. The
estimation results are of policy implication to the development of electric sector in China.


The causal relationship between overall GDP, industrial and agricultural value added and
consumption of different kinds of energy are investigated using vector error correction model for
the case of Iran within 1967–2003. A long-run unidirectional relationship from GDP to total energy
and bidirectional relationship between GDP and gas as well as GDP and petroleum products
consumption for the whole economy was discovered. Causality is running from value added to total
energy, electricity, gas and petroleum products consumption and from gas consumption to value
added in industrial sector. The long-run bidirectional relations hold between value added and total
energy, electricity and petroleum products consumption in the agricultural sector. The short-run
causality runs from GDP to total energy and petroleum products consumption, and also industrial
value added to total energy and petroleum products consumption in this sector.


Energy consumption and GDP are expected to grow by 5.9% and 7% annually until 2025 in Turkey.
This paper tries to unfold the linkage between energy consumption and GDP by undertaking a
cointegration analysis for Turkey with annual data over the period 1970–2003. The analysis shows
that energy consumption and GDP are co-integrated. This means that there is a (possibly
bi-directional) causality relationship between the two. We establish that there is a unidirectional
causality running from GDP to energy consumption indicating that energy saving would not harm
economic growth in Turkey. In addition, we find that energy consumption keeps on growing as long
as the economy grows in Turkey.
This paper applies a new panel data stationarity testing procedure, first developed byCarrion-i-
Silvestre et al. [2005, Econometrics Journal 8, 159–175], with panel VARs that employ the
generalized method of moment techniques in order to re-investigate the dynamic interactions
between energy consumption per capita (LEC) and real GDP per capita (LRY) in 22 developed and 18
developing countries.When multiple breaks in the series are taken into account, there is convincing
evidence of panel stationarity for LEC and LRY in both groups. The energy crises evidently had a
substantive impact on both LEC and LRYin all sample countries. Furthermore, our panel VARs attest
to bidirectional causality between LEC and LRY in developed countries, but there is unidirectional
causality from LRY to LEC in developing countries. Finally, from the orthogonalized impulse response
functions, all of the variables in the panel VARs have a positive effect on each other, but their impact
is greater and more persistent in developing countries. Some important policy implications do
emerge.


This paper examines two issues that are central to the understanding of the need to increase
efficiency in the use, distribution, and production of energy in the Caribbean region. The empirical
results of this Paper suggest the following: first, the three Caribbean countries provide evidence of
short-run bi-directional Granger-causality from energy consumption to real gross domestic product
per capita. Second, the forecasts with A BVAR model indicate that significant growth in energy
demand could be expected in Haiti, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago until at least 2010. Third, the
increased growth in energy consumption suggests the need for long-term commitments from
Caribbean countries to undertake a series of policy, economic, market, and research and
development measures to advance the adoption and deployment of new energy technologies.


There is a rapidly growing literature on the interaction between energy use and economic
development, with many analysts drawing policy conclusions on the basis of Granger causality tests
that involve only an energy and an economic variable. This paper attempts to demonstrate
empirically that such studies, although useful for certain applications, may be of limited use for
policy purposes. After outlining theoretical and methodological issues associated with such
approaches, I apply bivariate energy–economy causality tests for Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, using aggregate and sectoral data and three
differentmodern econometric methods. The results, which are often contradictory or economically
implausible, illustrate explicitly that one should be cautious when drawing policy implications with
the aid of bivariate causality tests on small samples. I therefore underline the importance of utilizing
as large sample sizes as possible and using multivariate models,which are closer to economic theory,
accommodate several mechanisms and causality channels and provide a better representation of
real-world interactions between energy use and economic growth.
This article provides fresh empirical evidences for the income and price elasticies of the residential
energy demand both in the short-run and long-run for Turkey over the period 1968–2005, using the
bounds testing procedure to cointegration. The computed elasticities of income and price are
consistent with the previous studies and, as expected, the long-run elasticities are greater than the
short-run elasticities. An augmented form of Granger causality analysis is implemented among
residential electricity, income, price and urbanization. In the long-run, causality runs interactively
through the error-correction term from income, price and urbanization to residential energy but the
short-run causality tests are inconclusive The parameter stability of the short-run as well as long-run
coefficients in the residential energy demand function are tested. The results of these tests display a
stable pattern.


Energy consumption growth ismuch higher than economic growth for Taiwan in recent years,
worsening its energy efficiency. This paper provides a solid explanation by examining the
equilibrium relationship between GDP and disaggregated energy consumption under a non-linear
framework. The threshold co-integration test developed with asymmetric dynamic adjusting
processes proposed by Hansen and Seo [Hansen, B.E., Seo, B., 2002. Testing for two-regime
threshold cointegration in vector error-correctionmodels. Journal of Econometrics 110, 293–318.] is
applied.Non-linear co- integrations betweenGDP and disaggregated energy consumptions are
confirmed except for oil consumption. The two-regime vector error-correction models (VECM) show
that the adjustment process of energy consumption toward equilibrium is highly persistent when an
appropriately threshold is reached. There is mean-reverting behavior when the threshold is reached,
making aggregate and disaggregated energy consumptions grow faster than GDP in Taiwan.



Using a neo-classical aggregate production model where capital, labor and energy are treated as
separate inputs, this paper tests for the existence and direction of causality between output growth
and energy use in China at both aggregated total energy and disaggregated levels as coal, oil and
electricity consumption. Using the Johansen cointegration technique, the empirical findings indicate
that there exists long-run cointegration among output, labor, capital and energy use in China at both
aggregated and all three disaggregated levels. Then using a VEC specification, the short-run
dynamics of the interested variables are tested, indicating that there exists Granger causality
running from electricity and oil consumption to GDP, but does not exist Granger causality running
from coal and total energy consumption to GDP. On the other hand, short-run Granger causality
exists from GDP to total energy, coal and oil consumption, but does not exist from GDP to electricity
consumption. We thus propose policy suggestions to solve the energy and sustainable development
dilemma in China as: enhancing energy supply security and guaranteeing energy supply, especially in
the short run to provide adequate electric power supply and set up national strategic oil reserve;
enhancing energy efficiency to save energy; diversifying energy sources, energetically exploiting
renewable energy and drawing out corresponding policies and measures; and finally in the long run,
transforming development pattern and cut reliance on resource- and energy-dependent industries.
The relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is considered as an imperative
issue in energy economics. Previous studies have ignored the nonlinear behavior which could be
caused by structural breaks. In this study, both linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests are
applied to examine the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth for a
sample of Asian newly industrialized countries as well as the U.S. This study finds evidence
supporting a neutrality hypothesis for the United States, Thailand, and South Korea. However,
empirical evidence on Philippines and Singapore reveals a unidirectional causality running from
economic growth to energy consumption while energy consumption may have affected economic
growth for Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia. Policy implications are also discussed.


The paper examines the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth for
eleven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test,
the study finds that energy consumption is cointegrated with economic growth in Cameroon, Cote
D'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Senegal, Sudan and Zimbabwe. Moreover, this test suggests that energy
consumption has a significant positive long run impact on economic growth in Ghana, Kenya,
Senegal and Sudan. Granger causality test based on vector error correction model (VECM) shows bi-
directional relationship between energy consumption and economic growth for Gambia, Ghana and
Senegal. However, Granger causality test shows that economic growth Granger causes energy
consumption in Sudan and Zimbabwe. The neutrality hypothesis is confirmed in respect of
Cameroon and Cote D'Ivoire. The same result of no causality was found for Nigeria, Kenya and Togo.
The result shows that each country should formulate appropriate energy conservation policies
taking into cognizance of her peculiar condition.


This paper applies a recent advance in panel analysis to estimate the panel cointegration and panel
vector error correction models for a set of 22 OECD countries using annual data covering the period
1960–2001. We investigate the relationship between energy consumption and income using an
aggregate production function and controlling for the capital stock, as well as by exploring the
dynamic directions of the causality among these three variables. We firstly obtain solid and
convincing evidence of a fairly strong long-run equilibrium relationship among them. Secondly, it is
found that the capital stock is much more productive than energy consumption. Third, it is observed
that neglecting the impact of the capital stock on income tends to overestimate the effect of energy
consumption. Finally, the panel causality test shows bi-directional causal linkages exist among
energy consumption, the capital stock and economic growth. Overall, the findings reveal that the
capital stock plays a critical role in realizing the dynamic relationship between energy and income.


This paper examines the relationship between capital formation, energy consumption and real GDP
in a panel of G7 countries using panel unit root, panel cointegration, Granger causality and long-run
structural estimation. We find that capital formation, energy consumption and real GDP are
cointegrated and that capital formation and energy consumption Granger cause real GDP positively
in the long run. We find that a 1% increase in energy consumption increases real GDP by
0.12–0.39%, while a 1% increase in capital formation increases real GDP by 0.1–0.28%.
In this paper we examine the causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic
growth in South Africa.We incorporate the employment rate as an intermittent variable in the
bivariate model between electricity consumption and economic growth—thereby creating a simple
trivariate causality framework. Our empirical results show that there is a distinct bidirectional
causality between electricity consumption and economic growth in South Africa. In addition, the
results show that employment in South Africa Grangercauses economic growth. The results apply
irrespective of whether the causality is estimated in the short-run or in the long-run formulation.
The study, therefore, recommends that policies geared towards the expansion of the electricity
infrastructure should be intensified in South Africa in order to cope with the increasing demand
exerted by the country's strong economic growth and rapid industrialisation programme. This will
certainly enable the country to avoid unprecedented power outages similar to those experienced in
the country in mid-January 2008.


The aim of this paper is to re-examine the causal relationship between energy consumption and
economic growth for seventeen African countries in a multivariate framework by including labor and
capital as additional variables. We apply the variance decomposition analysis due to Pesaran and
Shin [Pesaran M.H. and Shin, Y. Generalised impulse response analysis in linear multivariate models,
Economics Letters, 1998; 58; 17–29.] to evaluate how important is the causal impact of energy
consumption on economic growth relative to labor and capital. The results of our multivariate
modified Granger causality analysis due to Toda and Yamamoto [Toda, H.Y. and Yamamoto, T.
Statistical inference in vector autoregressions with possibly integrated process, Journal of
Econometrics, 1995; 66; 225–250.] tend to reject the neutrality hypothesis for the energy–income
relationship in fifteen out of the seventeen countries. In contrast, results of our variance
decomposition analyses show that in eleven out of the seventeen countries, energy is no more than
a contributing factor to output growth and not an important one when compared to capital and
labor. Labor and capital are the most important factors in output growth in fifteen out of the
seventeen countries. However, these results should be interpreted with care as they may not be
sufficiently robust enough to support the inference that energy consumption plays a minor role in
the economic growth of African countries.


This study examines the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth for six
Central American countries over the period 1980–2004 within a multivariate framework. Given the
relatively short span of the time series data, a panel cointegration and error correction model is
employed to infer the causal relationship. Based on the heterogeneous panel cointegration test by
Pedroni (Pedroni, P., 1999. Critical values for cointegration tests in heterogeneous panels with
multiple regressors. Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 61, 653–670; Pedroni, P., 2004.
Panel cointegration: asymptotic and finite sample properties of pooled time series tests with an
application to the PPP hypothesis: new results. Econometric Theory 20, 597–627), cointegration is
present between real GDP, energy consumption, the labor force, and real gross fixed capital
formation with the respective coefficients positive and statistically significant. The Grangercausality
results indicate the presence of both short-run and long-run causality from energy consumption to
economic growth which supports the growth hypothesis.
This study examines the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth for eleven
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States over the period 1991–2005 within a
multivariate panel data framework. Based on Pedroni's (1999, 2004) heterogeneous panel
cointegration test and corresponding error correction model, cointegration is present between real
GDP, energy consumption, real gross fixed capital formation, and labor force with the respective
coefficients positive and statistically significant. The results of the error correction model reveal the
presence of unidirectional causality from energy consumption to economic growth in the short-run
while bidirectional causality between energy consumption and economic growth in the long-run.
Thus, the results lend support for the feedback hypothesis associated with the relationship between
energy consumption and economic growth.


The increasing attention given to global energy issues and the international policies needed to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions have given a renewed stimulus to research interest in the linkages
between the energy sector and economic performance at country level. In this paper, we analyse
the causal relationship between economy and energy by adopting a Vector Error Correction Model
for non-stationary and cointegrated panel data with a large sample of developed and developing
countries and four distinct energy sectors. The results show that alternative country samples hardly
affect the causality relations, particularly in a multivariate multi-sector framework.


This study examines the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth for a
panel of nine South American countries over the period 1980–2005 within a multivariate
framework. Given the relatively short span of the time series data, a panel cointegration and error
correction model is employed to infer the causal relationship. Pedroni's heterogeneous panel
cointegration test reveals a long-run equilibrium relationship between real GDP, energy
consumption, the labor force, and real gross fixed capital formation with the respective coefficients
positive and statistically significant. The Granger-causality results indicate both short-run and long-
run causality from energy consumption to economic growth which supports the growth hypothesis.

This study tests the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in Sub-Saharan
Africa, using a panel co-integration approach. Country-level time series data of energy consumption
and economic growth are pooled and used to estimate the model. Sub-Saharan African countries in
the sample are classified into low income and middle income countries. The findings support the
neutrality hypothesis in the shortrun, except for middle income countries, and a strong causation
running in both directions is found in the long-run. The different results for low and middle income
countries provide evidence of the importance of income level in the causal relationship. This study
helps to explain the interdependence of energy consumption and economic growth in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Results are critical in formulating sustainable development policies that are geared to the
efficient allocation of resources which are expected to increase access to energy services in the
study region.
The debate about the precise role of energy in economic development remains contentious. Existing
empirical studies have produced varying results: some have argued the complementarity between
energy and other factors of production, and others have indicated that energy can be substituted
for other factors of production. Commonly, these studies have focused primarily on the developed
countries, one explanation being that supply constraints and price rigidities render any study on
factor substitutions in developing countries meaningless. However, the functional relationship
between energy consumption and income in developing countries is constantly investigated with
the use of regression techniques. While such techniques are useful in empirical analysis, no
mechanism exists for indicating causal directions between variables. This limits the scope for policy
analysis and prescription. The need to identify causal direction between energy consumption and
income growth in developing countries is overwhelming. Apart from providing further insights into
the role of energy in economic development, it provides policy analysts with a clearer understanding
of the likely impact of energy supply constraints on economic growth. This article examines the
causal directions between energy consumption and economic growth (proxied by GDP and GNP) for
Nigeria and Tanzania. The results show a simultaneous causal relationship between energy and
economic growth for both countries, the implication being that, unless energy supply constraints are
eased, economic growth and development will remain elusive to these countries. Given similar
economic characteristics and profiling the same energy scenario for other developing countries, our
finding supports the view that energy plays a key role in economic development.




A study of the relationship between electricity use and economic development in over one hundred
countries, constituting over 99% of the global economy has been undertaken. Correlations between
electricity consumption/capita and GDP/capita have been analysed and compared with those
between total primary energy supply/capita and GDP/capita. A supporting analysis has correlated
the proportion of energy used in the form electricity, the &e/E ratio', with GDP/capita. The general
conclusions of this research are that wealthy countries have a stronger correlation between
electricity use and wealth creation than do poor countries and that, for the global economy as a
whole, there is a stronger correlation between electricity use and wealth creation than there is
between total energy use and wealth. The study also shows that, in wealthy countries, the increase
in wealth over time correlates with an increase in the e/E ratio. The results imply that the energy
ratio ($/toe) should be replaced by the electricity ratio ($/kWh) as a development indicator and,
more precisely, by the e/E ratio (kWh/toe).


This paper tries to examine the Granger causality between electricity consumption per capita and
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita for India using annual data covering the period 1950–51 to
1996–97. Phillips–Perron tests reveal that both the series, after logarithmic transformation, are non-
stationary and individually integrated of order one. This study finds the absence of long-run
equilibrium relationship among the variables but there exists unidirectional Granger causality
running from economic growth to electricity consumption without any feedback effect. So,
electricity conservation policies can be initiated without deteriorating economic side effects.
This paper applies the error-correction model to examine the causal relationship between electricity
consumption and real GDP for China during 1971–2000. Our estimation results indicate that real
GDP and electricity consumption for China are cointegrated and there is unidirectional Granger
causality running from electricity consumption to real GDP but not vice versa. In order to overcome
the constraints on electricity consumption, the Chinese government has to speed up the nation-
wide interconnection of power networks, to upgrade urban and rural distribution grids, and to
accelerate rural electrification.

This paper examines the relationship between electricity consumption, employment and real
income in Australia within a cointegration and causality framework. We find that electricity
consumption, employment and real income are cointegrated and that in the long-run employment
and real income Granger cause electricity consumption, while in the short run there is weak
unidirectional Granger causality running from income to electricity consumption and from income
to employment.

This paper investigates the short- and long-run causality issues between electricity consumption and
economic growth in Korea by using the co-integration and error-correction models. It employs
annual data covering the period 1970–2002. The overall results show that there exists bi-directional
causality between electricity consumption and economic growth. This means that an increase in
electricity consumption directly affects economic growth and that economic growth also stimulates
further electricity consumption.

This paper investigates the causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic
growth among the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) 4 members, namely Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, using modern time-series techniques for the period 1971–2002.
The results indicate that there is a bi-directional causality between electricity consumption and
economic growth in Malaysia and Singapore. This means that an increase in electricity consumption
directly affects economic growth and that economic growth also stimulates further electricity
consumption in the two countries. However, uni-directional causality runs from economic growth to
electricity consumption in Indonesia and Thailand without any feedback effect. Thus, electricity
conservation policies can be initiated without deteriorating economic side effects in the two
countries.
This paper explores whether energy conservation policies can be implemented in countries with the
same level of development. That is, is restraining energy consumption without compromising
economic growth feasible in all industrialized countries? A new Granger non-causality testing
procedure developed by Toda and Yamamoto [1995, Journal of Econometrics 66, 225–250] is
applied to re-investigate the relationship, if any, between energy consumption and income in 11
major industrialized countries. The results clearly do not support the view that energy consumption
and income are neutral with respect to each other, except in the case of the United Kingdom,
Germany and Sweden where a neutral relationship is found. Bi-directional causality in the United
States and unidirectional running from energy consumption to GDP in Canada, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Switzerland are found. This indicates that energy conservation may hinder
economic growth in the latter five countries. Further, the causality relationship appears to be uni-
directional but reversed for France, Italy and Japan which implies that, in these three countries,
energy conservation may be viable without being detrimental to economic growth.


This work investigates the causality relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) and energy
consumption in the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Recently developed panel
cointegration and causality techniques are used to uncover the direction of energy–GDP causality in
the GCC. Empirical results indicate a unidirectional causality running from GDP to energy
consumption. Evidence shows no support for the hypothesis that energy consumption is the source
of GDP growth in the GCC countries. Such results suggest that energy conservation policies may be
adopted without much concern about their adverse effects on the growth of GCC economies.


This paper examines the dynamic causal relationships between pollutant emissions, energy
consumption, and output for France using cointegration and vector error-correction modelling
techniques. We argue that these variables are strongly inter-related and therefore their relationship
must be examined using an integrated framework. The results provide evidence for the existence of
a fairly robust longrun relationship between these variables for the period 1960–2000. The causality
results support the argument that economic growth exerts a causal influence on growth of energy
use and growth of pollution in the long run. The results also point to a uni-directional causality
running from growth of energy use to output growth in the short run.


In this paper, we examine the causal relationship between the per capita electricity consumption
and the per capita GDP for Bangladesh using cointegration and vector error correction model. Our
results show that there is unidirectional causality from per capita GDP to per capita electricity
consumption. However, the per capita electricity consumption does not cause per capita GDP in
case of Bangladesh. The finding has significant implications from the point of view of energy
conservation, emission reduction and economic development.

This article applies recently developed panel unit root and panel cointegration techniques to
estimate the long-run and short-run income and price elasticities for residential demand for
electricity in G7 countries. The panel results indicate that in the long-run residential demand for
electricity is price elastic and income inelastic. The study concludes that from an environmental
perspective there is potential to use pricing policies in the G7 countries to curtail residential
electricity demand, and thus curb carbon emissions, in the long run.
This paper examines the causal relationship between the per capita energy consumption and the
per capita GDP in a panel of 11 selected oil exporting countries by using panel unit-root tests and
panel cointegration analysis. The results show a unidirectional strong causality from economic
growth to energy consumption for the oil exporting countries. The findings have practical policy
implications for decision makers in the area of macroeconomic planning. In most major oil exporting
countries, government policies keep domestic prices bellow free market level, resulting in high
levels of domestic energy consumption. The results imply that the energy conservation through
reforming energy price policies has no damaging repercussions on economic growth for this group
of countries.

This paper reinvestigates the energy consumption–GDP growth nexus in a panel error correction
model using data on 20 net energy importers and exporters from 1971 to 2002. Among the energy
exporters, there was bidirectional causality between economic growth and energy consumption in
the developed countries in both the short and long run, while in the developing countries energy
consumption stimulates growth only in the short run. The former result is also found for energy
importers and the latter result exists only for the developed countries within this category. In
addition, compared to the developing countries, the developed countries’ elasticity response in
terms of economic growth from an increase in energy consumption is larger although its income
elasticity is lower and less than unitary. Lastly, the implications for energy policy calling for a more
holistic approach are discussed.

This paper reexamines the inter-temporal link between energy consumption and income in six
developing countries with diverse economic backgrounds and energy statistics, in a production
function framework. We employ the generalized variance decompositions and generalized impulse
response techniques to see if the growth of income and energy consumption contains considerable
information to predict each other. In all countries, energy appears as an essential factor of
production. Results indicate that energy may be a relatively more important input than labor and/or
capital in some countries. Hence, neutrality of energy does not seem to hold.


This paper provides a detailed analysis of the energy consumption in Turkey during the last 40 years.
It investigates the causal relationships between income and energy consumption in two ways: first,
the relationship is studied at the aggregate level; then, we focus on the industrial sector. Previous
findings suggest that, in the case of Turkey, there is a unidirectional causality running from energy
consumption to growth. However, our findings suggest that in the long run, income and energy
consumption appear to be neutral with respect to each other both at the aggregate and at the
industrial level. We also find a strong evidence of instantaneous causality, which means that
contemporaneous values of energy consumption and income are correlated. Furthermore, a
descriptive analysis is conducted in order to reveal the differences in the use of energy resources.
We conclude that energy conservation policies are necessary for environmental concerns and our
empirical results imply that such policies would not impede economic growth in the long term.
The goal of this paper is to examine any causal effects between electricity consumption and real
GDP for 30 OECD countries. We use a bootstrapped causality testing approach and unravel evidence
in favour of electricity consumption causing real GDP in Australia, Iceland, Italy, the Slovak Republic,
the Czech Republic, Korea, Portugal, and the UK. The implication is that electricity conservation
policies will negatively impact real GDP in these countries. However, for the rest of the 22 countries
our findings suggest that electricity conversation policies will not affect real GDP.

The purpose of this study is to re-investigate the relationship between electricity consumption and
economic growth in Malaysia from 1972:1 to 2003:4. This study adopted the newly developed
ECMbased F-test [Kanioura, A., Turner, P., 2005. Critical values for an F-test for cointegration in the
multivariate model. Applied Economics 37(3), 265–270] for cointegration to examine the presence
of long run equilibrium relationship through the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. The
empirical evidence suggests that electricity consumption and economic growth are not cointegrated
in Malaysia. However, the standard Granger’s test and MWALD test suggest that electricity
consumption and economic growth in Malaysia Granger causes each other. This finding provides
policymakers with a better understanding of electricity consumption and allows them to formulate
electricity consumption policy to support the economic development and to enhance the
productivity of capital, labour and other factors of production for future economic growth in
Malaysia.


We analyze the long-run relationship between energy consumption and real gross domestic product
(GDP) in Turkey taking into account the size of unrecorded economy. Since in developing countries,
mainly due to the unrecorded economic activities, the official GDP is not measured correctly, the
investigation of the linkage between energy consumption and official GDP may not give reliable
results. In this study, empirical results for the case of Turkey over the period 1970–2005 suggest
that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between the officially calculated GDP and energy
consumption. Besides, using the error-correction modeling technique, we find out that
unidirectional causality runs from official GDP to energy in both short and long runs. However, when
we take into account unrecorded economy, we detect neither cointegration nor causality between
energy consumption and true GDP. These empirical findings imply that: first, energy conservation
policies can be implemented in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without any adverse
effect on the recorded economic activities; second the production function in the unrecorded
economy is not stable. Furthermore, economic policies to combat unrecorded economy may not
serve as a complement to energy conservation policies.
This paper applies the causality test to examine the causal relationship between primary energy
consumption (EC) and real Gross National Product (GNP) for Turkey during 1970–2006.We employ
unit root tests, the augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and the Philips–Perron (PP), Johansen
cointegration test, and Pair-wise Granger causality test to examine relation between EC and GNP.
Our empirical results indicate that the two series are found to be non-stationary. However, first
differences of these series lead to stationarity. Further, the results indicate that EC and GNP are
cointegrated and there is bidirectional causality running from EC to GNP and vice versa. This means
that an increase in EC directly affects economic growth and that economic growth also stimulates
further EC. This bidirectional causality relationship between EC and GNP determined for Turkey at
1970–2006 period is in accordance with the ones in literature reported for similar countries.
Consequently, we conclude that energy is a limiting factor to economic growth in Turkey and,
hence, shocks to energy supply will have a negative impact on economic growth.


This study attempts to empirically examine the dynamic causal relationships between carbon
emissions, energy consumption, income, and foreign trade in the case of Turkey using the time-
series data for the period 1960–2005. This research tests the inter relationship between the
variables using the
bounds testing to cointegration procedure. The bounds test results indicate that there exist two
forms of long-run relationships between the variables. In the case of first form of long-run
relationship, carbon emissions are determined by energy consumption, income and foreign trade. In
the case of second long-
run relationship, income is determined by carbon emissions, energy consumption and foreign trade.
An augmented form of Granger causality analysis is conducted amongst the variables. The long-run
relationship of CO2 emissions, energy consumption, income and foreign trade equation is also
checked for the parameter stability. The empirical results suggest that income is the most significant
variable in explaining the carbon emissions in Turkey which is followed by energy consumption and
foreign trade. Moreover, the re exists a stable carbon emissions function. The results also provide
important policy recommendations.

This study extends the recent work of Ang (2007) [Ang,J.B.,2007. CO2 emissions, energy
consumption, and output in France. Energy Policy35,4772–4778] in examining the causal
relationship between
carbon-dioxide emissions, energy consumption,and output within a panel vector error correction
model for six Central American countries over the period 1971–2004. In long-run equilibrium energy
 consumption has a positive and statistically significant impact on emissions while real output
exhibits the inverted U-shape pattern associated with the Environmental Kuznets Curve(EKC)
hypothesis. The short-run dynamics indicate unidirectional causality from energy consumption and
real output,
respectively, to emissions along with bidirectional causality between energy consumption and real
output. In the long-run there appears to be bidirectional causality between energy consumption and
emissions.
This paper examines the causal relationship between electricity consumption, exports and gross
domestic product (GDP) for a panel of Middle Eastern countries. We find that for the panel as a
whole there are statistically significant feedback effects between these variables. A 1 percent
increase in electricity consumption increases GDP by 0.04 percent, a 1 percent increase in exports
increases GDP by 0.17 percent and a 1 percent increase in GDP generates a 0.95 percent increase in
electricity consumption. The policy implications are that for the panel as a whole these countries
should invest in electricity infrastructure and step up electricity conservation policies to avoid a
reduction in electricity consumption adversely affecting economic growth. Further policy
implications are that for the panel as a whole promoting exports, particularly non-oilexports, is a
means to promote economic growth and that expansion of exports can be realized without having
adverse effects on energy conservation policies.


This study probes nexus between electricity supply, employment and real GDP for India within a
multivariate framework using autoregressive distributed lag(ARDL) bounds testing approach of
cointegration. Long-run equilibrium relationship has been established among these variables for the
time span 1970–71 to 2005–06. The study further establishes long-and short-run Granger causality
running from real GDP and electricity supply to employment without any feedback effect. Thus,
growth in real GDP and electricity supply are responsible for the high level of employment in India.
The absence of causality running from electricity supply to real GDP implies that electricity demand
and supplyside measures can be adopted to reduce the wastage of electricity, which would not
affect future economic growth of India.



In this paper, the Johansen cointegration technique is used to examine the causal relationship
between per capita energy consumption(PCEC) and per capita gross domestic product (PCGDP) for
Tunisia during the 1971–2004 period. In order to test for Granger causality in the presence of
cointegration among the variables, a vector error correction model (VECM) is used instead of a
vector autoregressive (VAR) model. Our stimation results indicate that the PCGDP and PCEC for
Tunisia are related by one cointegrating vector and that there is a long-run bi-directional causal
relationship between the two series and a short-
run unidirectional causality from energy to gross domestic product(GDP). The source of causation in
the long-run is found to be the error-correction terms in both directions. Hence, an important policy
implication resulting from this analysis is that energy can be considered as a limiting factor to GDP
growth in Tunisia. Conclusions for Tunisia may also be relevant for a number of countries that have
to go through a similar development path of increasing pressure on already scarce energy resources.
In this paper, we examine the inter temporal causal relationship between energy consumption and
economic growth in Tanzania during the period of 1971–2006. Unlike the majority of the previous
studies, we employ the newly developed autoregressive distributed lag(ARDL) - bounds testing
approach by Pesaran et al. [2001. Bounds testing approaches to the analys is of level relationships.
Journal of
Applied Econometrics 16, 289–326] to examine this linkage. We also use two proxies of energy
consumption, namely total energy consumption per capita and electricity consumption per capita.
The results of the bounds test show that there is a stable long-run relationship between each of the
proxies of energy consumption and economic growth. The results of the causality test, on the other
hand, show that there is a unidirectional causal flow from total energy consumption to economic
growth and a prima- facie causal flow from electricity consumption to economic growth. Overall, the
study finds that energy consumption spurs economic growth in Tanzania.



During the last three decades, following closely the developments in econometric theory, energy
and environmental economists have empirically examined the energy-income nexus for different
countries and time periods. However, today, in spite of the growing interest in this area, the state of
knowledge is still controversial and unsettled. This viewpoint paper attempts to highlight some of
the issues related to the existing literature on the long-run relationship and causality between
energy consumption and economic growth. In particular, it discusses how it is difficult to make
policy recommendations on the basis of inconsistent and conflicting results in the published
literature on the subject. In order to do so,
the paper first illustrates the increasing trend in the number of studies published in this area
providing also a brief comparison of the conventional methods used to estimate the energy-income
nexus. It then deals with new directions and different view points on the same issue.


This study applies the panel stationarity test developed by [Carrion-i-Silvestreetal2005. Breaking
thepanels: An application to GDP per capita. Econometrics Journal 8,159–175] to examine the
stationarity of energy consumption per capita for a panel of 13 Pacific Island countries over the
period 1980–2005. This test has the advantage that it allows for multiple structural breaks at
unknown dates that can differ across countries and can account for all forms of cross-sectional
correlation between countries. The conclusion from the study is that energy consumption per capita
inapproximately 60% of countries is stationary and that energy consumption per capita for the panel
as a whole is stationary. The study offers several suggestions for modelling energy consumption and
policy-making in the Pacific Islands.
Electricity has been the foundation of economic growth, and constitutes one of the vital infra-
structural inputs in socio-economic development. The world faces a surge in demand for electricity
that is driven by such powerful forces as population growth, extensive urbanization,
industrialization, and the rise in the standard of living. This paper attempts to ascertain whether
there is asystematic relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth. To this
end, we usea large set of data that spans 88 countries during the period, 1975–2004. A statistically
significant inverted-U-shaped relationship between per-capita consumption of electricity and per-
capita income is detected. Nevertheless, by using
a purchasing power parity that is much higher than the per-capita income of all the countries in the
world, the level of per-capita income is estimated at the peak point of per-capita electricity
consumption to be $61,379 in 2000 constant international dollars. Moreover, we segment the
sample into Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and non-
OECD countries, and separately analyze the developed and developing countries. The separate
estimation shows that even though the peak income is higher than the average per-capita income, a
statistically
significant inverted-U-shaped relationship is found in OECD and developed countries but not in non-
OECD and developing countries.


This study examines the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth
for a panel of twenty OECD countries over the period
1985–2005withinamultivariateframework.Given the relatively short span of the time-series data, a
panel cointegration and error correction model is employed to infer the causal relationship. The
heterogeneous panel cointegration test reveals a long-run equilibrium relationship between real
GDP, renewable energy consumption, real gross fixed capital formation, and the labor force with the
respective coefficients positive and statistically significant. The Granger-causality results indicate
bidirectional causality between renewable energy consumption and economic growth in both the
short- and long-run.


This paper investigates the dynamic causal relationship between energy consumption and economic
growth in Lebanon over the period 1980–2009. Within a bivariate framework, imposed on us due to
data limitations, and in an effort to increase the robustness of our results, we employ a variety of
causality tests, namely,Hsiao,Toda-Yamamoto, and vector error correction based Granger causality
tests. We find strong evidence of a bidirectional relationship both in the short-run and in the long-
run, indicating that energy is a limiting factor to economic growth in Lebanon. From a policy
perspective, the confirmation of the feedback hypothesis warns against the use of policy
instruments geared towards restricting energy consumption, as these may lead to adverse effects
on economic growth. Consequently, there is a pressing need to revise the current national energy
policy that calls for a 5% energy conservation target. Also, to shield the country from external supply
shocks, given its substantial dependence on energy imports, policy makers should emphasize the
development of domestic energy resources. Further, the most pertinent implication is that relaxing
the present electric capacity shortages should be made a national priority, in view of its potential
positive effect on the economy.
The aim of this paper is to study the nature of the relationship between energy consumption and
economic growth in Cameroon through a three-step approach: (i) Study the stationarity of the
chronic,
(ii) test of causality between variables and (iii) estimate the appropriate model. The study concludes
in a non-stationarity of the series. Using the data in first difference, the Granger causality test yields
a strong evidence for unidirectional causality running from OIL to GDP. Cointegration tests also
show that these two series are co-integrated and the Error Correction Model (ECM) reveals that
every percentage increase in Oil products consumption increases economic growth by around 1.1%.
This result confirms the intuition that an economic policy aimed at improving energy supply will
necessarily have a positive impact on economic growth. On the other side, a lack of energy is a
major bottle neck for further economic development in Cameroon.

In this paper we empirically investigate the causal link between energy consumption and economic
growth employing a Markov switching Granger causality analysis. We carry out our investigation
using annual U.S. real GDP, total final energy consumption and total primary energy consumption
data which cover the period between 1968 and 2010. We find that there are significant changes in
the causal relation between energy consumption and economic growth over the sample period
under investigation. Our results show that total final energy consumption and total primary energy
consumption have significant predictive content for real economic activity in the U.S. economy.
Furthermore, the causality running from energy consumption to output growth seems to be strongly
apparent particularly during the periods of economic downturn and energy crisis. We also document
that output growth has predictive power in explaining total energy consumption. Furthermore, the
power of output growth in predicting total energy consumption is found to diminish after the mid of
1980s.

This paper examines the interrelationships between energy consumption, foreign direct investment
and economic growth using dynamic panel data models in simultaneous-equations for a global panel
consisting of 65 countries. The time component of our dataset is 1990–2011 inclusive. To make the
panel data analysis more homogenous, we also investigate this interrelationship for a number of sub-
panels which are constructed based on the income level of countries. In this way, we end up with
three income panels; namely, high income, middle income, and low income panels. In the empirical
part, we draw on the growth theory and augment the classical growth model, which consists of
capital stock, laborforce and inflation, with foreign direct investment and energy. Generally, we
show mixed results about the interrelationship between energy consumption, FDI and economic
growth.

Public debates on electricity policy in Hong Kong focus on the regulation regime but seldom discuss
the macroeconomic impact. In this paper, we use the novel dataset on electricity consumption and
report the following findings: (1) there is a long run equilibrium relationship between real GDP and
electricity consumption; (2) a one-way causal effect exists from electricity consumption to real GDP;
(3) a significant adjustment process occurs when equilibrium is interrupted; (4) there exists possible
structural change in the relationship between electricity consumption and economic activities in
1990s.
To cope with the increasing electricity demand and to overcome the supply shortage of electricity, it
is imminent that investments be made on the electricity generation sector on a large scale in
Indonesia. This paper attempts to investigate the causal relationship between electricity generation
and economic growth in Indonesia, using time-series techniques for the period of 1971–2002. The
results indicate that there is a uni-directional causality running from economic growth to electricity
generation without any feedback effect. Thus, economic growth stimulates further electricity
generation, and policies for reducing electricity generation can be initiated without deteriorating
economic side effects in Indonesia.

This paper considers the possibility of both a linear effect and nonlinear effect of energy
consumption on economic growth, using data for the period 1955–2003 in Taiwan. We find
evidence of a level-dependent effect between the two variables. Allowing for a nonlinear effect of
energy consumption growth sheds new light on the explanation of the characteristics of the energy-
growth link. We also provide evidence that the relationship between energy consumption and
economic growth in Taiwan is characterized by an inverse U-shape. Some previous studies support
the view that energy consumption may promote economic growth. However, the conclusion drawn
from the empirical findings suggests that such a relationship exists only where there is a low level of
energy consumption in Taiwan. We show that a threshold regression provides a better empirical
model than the standard linear model and that policy-makers should seek to capture economic
structures associated with different stages of economic growth. It is also worth noting that the
energy consumption threshold was reached in the case of Taiwan in the world energy crises periods
of 1979 and 1982.


In this paper we investigate the co-movement and the causality relationship between energy
consumption as well as electricity consumption and the HDI (human development index) using as a
proxy of human well-being and by including energy prices as an additional variable, in fifteen
developing countries for the period 1988 to 2008. Recently developed tests for the panel unit root,
heterogeneous panel cointegration, and panel-based error correction models are employed.
The empirical results support the neutrality hypothesis in the short-term, regards total energy or
electricity consumption, implying an absence of causality running in either direction. In the short
term, energy as well as electricity consumption has a neutral effect on the HDI.
In the long-term the findings provide a clear support of a negative cointegration relationship
between energy consumption and the HDI. While a positive cointegration relationship exists
between electricity
consumption and HDI.
A 1% increase in per capita energy consumption reduces the HDI by 0.8% and, a 1% increase in per
capita electricity consumption increases the HDI by 0.22%. Moreover, a 1% increase in energy price
reduces the HDI by around 0.11%.
This study thus provides empirical evidence of long-run and causal relationships between energy
consumption and the HDI for our sample of countries; supporting the assertion that lack or limited
access to modern energy services could hamper economic and human development prospects of
countries and underpins all the MDGs (millennium development goals).
The aim of this paper is to re-examine the causal relationship between energy consumption and
economic growth for seventeen African countries in a multivariate framework by including labor and
capital as additional variables. We apply the variance decomposition analysis due to Pesaran and
Shin [Pesaran M.H. and Shin, Y. Generalised impulse response analysis in linear multivariate models,
Economics Letters, 1998; 58; 17–29.] to evaluate how important is the causal impact of energy
consumption on economic growth relative to labor and capital. The results of our multivariate
modified Granger causality analysis due to Toda and Yamamoto [Toda, H.Y. and Yamamoto, T.
Statistical inference in vector autoregressions with possibly integrated process, Journal of
Econometrics, 1995; 66; 225–250.] tend to reject the neutrality hypothesis for the energy–income
relationship in fifteen out of the seventeen countries. In contrast, results of our variance
decomposition analyses show that in eleven out of the seventeen countries, energy is no more than
a contributing factor to output growth and not an important one when compared to capital and
labor. Labor and capital are the most important factors in output growth in fifteen out of the
seventeen countries. However, these results should be interpreted with care as they may not be
sufficiently robust enough to support the inference that energy consumption plays a minor role in
the economic growth of African countries.


This paper examines the long-run relationship between energy consumption and real GDP, including
energy prices, for 25 OECD countries from 1981 to 2007. The distinction between common factors
and idiosyncratic components using principal component analysis allows to distinguish
betweendevelopments on aninternational and a national level as drivers of the long-run
relationship. Indeed, cointegration between the common components of the underlying variables
indicates that international developments dominate the long-run relationship between energy
consumption and real GDP. Furthermore, the results suggest that energy consumption is price-
inelastic. Causality tests indicate the presence of a bi-directional causal relationship between energy
consumption and economic growth.

Though there is a very large literature examining whether energy use Granger causes economic
output or vice versa, it is fairly inconclusive. Almost all existing studies use relatively short time
series, or panels with a relatively small time dimension. We apply Granger causality and
cointegration techniques to a Swedish time series dataset spanning 150 years to test whether
increases in energy use and energy quality have driven economic growth or vice versa.We show that
these techniques are very sensitive to variable definition, choice of additional variables in the
model, sample periods and size, and the introduction of structural breaks. The relationship between
energy and growth may also have changed over time – energy causes output in the full sample while
output causes energy use in recent smaller samples. Energy prices have a more robust causal impact
on both energy use and output.
Access to modern energy is believed to be a prerequisite for sustainable development, poverty
alleviation and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. However, theoretical
models and empirical results offer conflicting evidence on the relationship between energy
consumption and economic growth that we remain largely unsure of the cause-and-effect nature of
this relationship, if indeed a relationship exists at all.
This paper tests, in a panel context, the long-run relationship between energy access, and economic
growth for fifteen African countries from 1980 to 2008 by using recently developed panel
cointegration techniques. We adopt a three-stage approach, consisting of panel unit root, panel
cointegration and Granger causality tests to study the dynamic causal relationships between energy
consumption, energy prices and growth as well as relationship between electricity consumption,
prices and growth. Results show that GDP and energy consumption as well as GDP and electricity
move together in the long-run.
By estimating these long-run relationships and testing for causality using panel-based error
correction models, we found unidirectional long-run and short-run causality. The causality is running
from GDP to energy consumption in the short-run, and from energy consumption to GDP in the long-
run. There is also evidence of unidirectional causality running from electricity consumption to GDP
in the long-run.
This study thus provides empirical evidence of long-run and causal relationships between energy
consumption and economic growth for our sample of fifteen countries; suggesting that lack or
limited access to modern energy services could hamper economic growth and compromise the
development prospects of these countries.



This paper is a contribution to the on-going debate over whether there is a relationship between
energy consumption and economic growth. Although the oil exporting countries are among the
most energy-intensive economies in the world, little attention has been paid to the features of their
energy consumption. Therefore, this study empirically investigates the two variables dynamic
relationship in 12 oil exporting countries from 1990 to 2010. Using recently developed panel
econometric techniques, the present paper accounts for crosssection dependence and structural
breaks when analysing the energy-income nexus. The results of this study indicate that there exists a
long-run equilibrium relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. Furthermore,
the empirical evidence of a dynamic panel error-correction model reveals a short-run unidirectional
causality from energy consumption to economic growth, whereas in the long-run, it is the economic
process that determines the energy consumption trend.
The energy-growth literature contains a large number of discussions on the causal relationship
between energy consumption and economic growth. The central debate focuses on whether energy
consumption contributes or not to economic growth since it has direct implications for the
formulation of strategic policies. Nevertheless, current studies cannot provide a conclusive
suggestion due tomixed causality results. This inconclusive evidence is potentially attributed to
model specifications and the stage of economic development of the countries under investigation.
Hence, this study attempts to empirically re-investigate the validity of the energy-led growth
hypothesis using a different model specification and different stages of economic development for
85 selected countries around the globe. Overall, although the causality results are mixed among
countries, we do find a systematic pattern. In particular, Granger causality models with three and
four variables are more likely to support the hypothesis compared to their counterparts that contain
only two variables. In addition, both developed and developing countries are more likely to support
the energy-led growth hypothesis compared to the less developed or lowincome countries.
Therefore, causality results are very sensitive to the choice of themodel specification along with the
stages of economic development. Finally, energy conservation policies should only focus on low
income countries as these policies may not retard the process of economic growth.



This paper reassesses the causal relationship between per capita energy use and gross domestic
product, while controlling for capital and labour (productivity) inputs in a panel of 30 OECD
countries over the past 40 years. The paper uses panel unit root and cointegration testing and
specifies an appropriate vector error correction model to analyse the nexus between income and
energy use. In doing so we contribute to an old debate using modern tools that shed a new light.
There is some evidence that over the very short-run bidirectional causality exists. Our results also
show a strong unidirectional causality running from capital formation and GDP to energy usage. In
the long run the reverse causality, found in recent work, is lost. We then show that we can
reproduce these earlier results in our data if we reproduce a slightly misspecified model for the
Engle–Granger two-step procedure used in these earlier papers. Our findings thus imply that results
are very sensitive to model misspecification and careful testing of specifications is required. Our
results have some strong policy implications. They suggest that policies aimed at reducing energy
usage or promoting energy efficiency are not likely to have a detrimental effect on economic
growth, except over the very short run.


This paper estimates the total effect of power outages on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa
over the period 1995–2007. We pay close attention both to potential errors of measurement of
African economic growth and to the endogeneity of outages. As suggested by Henderson et al.
(American Economic Review 102(2): 994–1028, 2012), we combine Penn World Tables GDP data
with satellite-based data on nightlights to arrive at a more accurate measure of economic growth.
Following Andersen et al. (Review of Economics and Statistics 94(4): 903–924, 2012), we also
employ lightning density as an instrument for power outages. Our results suggest a substantial
growth drag of a weak power infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa.
This paper combines two aggregate production function models—one with urbanization as a shift
factor and one that includes energy/electricity consumption and physical capital—to estimate the
macro-level relationship among urbanization, energy/electricity consumption, and economic growth
using a panel method that is robust to both cointegration and cross-sectional dependence. For four
panels (comprising in turn high, upper middle, lower middle, and low income countries) GDP per
capita, total final energy and electricity consumption per capita, gross fixed capital formation per
capita, and urbanization were found to be 1(1), cross-sectionally dependent, and cointegrated. The
long-run elasticity estimates suggest (i) that urbanization is important to and associated with
economic growth, (ii) that urbanization's impact on economic growth ranges from substantially
negative to nearly neutral to positive as countries develop—an "urbanization ladder" effect, and (iii)
that less developed countries are over-urbanized (their elasticities being negative).


While the availability of electricity by itself is not a panacea for the economic and social problems
facing Africa, the supply of electricity is nevertheless believed to be a necessary requirement for
Africa’s economic and social development. This paper tests the long-run and causal relationship
between electricity consumption per capita and real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for 17
African countries for the period 1971–2001 using a newly developed cointegration test proposed by
Pesaran et al. (2001) and using a modified version of the Granger causality test due to Toda and
Yamamoto (1995). The advantage of using these two approaches is that they both avoid the pre-
testing bias associated with conventional unit root and cointegration tests. The empirical evidence
shows that there was a long-run relationship between electricity consumption per capita and real
GDP per capita for only 9 countries and Granger causality for only 12 countries. For 6 countries
there was a positive uni-directional causality running from real GDP per capita to electricity
consumption per capita; an opposite causality for 3 countries and bi-directional causality for the
remaining 3 countries. The result should, however, be interpreted with care as electricity
consumption accounts for less than 4% of total energy consumption in Africa and only grid-supplied
electricity is taken into account.


The purpose of this study is to estimate the relationships between GDP and electricity consumption
in 10 newly industrializing and developing Asian countries using both single data sets and panel data
procedures. The empirical results from single data set indicate that the causality directions in the 10
Asian countries are mixed while there is a uni-directional short- run causality running from economic
growth to electricity consumption and a bi-directional long-run causality between electricity
consumption and economic growth if the panel data procedure is implemented. These empirical
findings imply that electricity conservation policies through both rationalizing the electricity supply
efficiency improvement to avoid the wastage of electricity and managing demand side to reduce the
electricity consumption without affecting the end-user benefits could be initiated without adverse
effect on economic growth. The findings on the long-run relationship indicate that a sufficiently
large supply of electricity can ensure that a higher level of economic growth.
This paper attempts to investigate the causal relationship between electricity consumption and
economic growth among seven South American countries, namely Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela using widely accepted time- series techniques for the
period 1975–2006.
The results indicate that the causal nexus between electricity consumption and economic growth
varies across countries. There is a unidirectional, short-run causality from electricity consumption to
real GDP for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, and Ecuador. This means that an increase in
electricity consumption directly affects economic growth in those countries. In Venezuela, there is a
bi-directional causality between electricity consumption and economic growth. This implies that an
increase in electricity consumption directly affects economic growth and that economic growth also
stimulates further electricity consumption in that country. However, no causal relationships exist in
Peru. The documented evidence from seven South American countries can provide useful
information for each government with regard to energy and growth policy.


The aim of this paper is to provide new empirical evidence on the relationship between energy
consumption and economic growth for 21 African countries over the period from 1970 to 2006,
using recently developed panel cointegration and causality tests. The countries are divided into two
groups: net energy importers and net energy exporters. It is found that there exists a long-run
equilibrium relationship between energy consumption, real GDP, prices, labor and capital for each
group of countries as well as for the whole set of countries. This result is robust to possible cross-
country dependence and still holds when allowing for multiple endogenous structural breaks, which
can differ among countries. Furthermore, we find that decreasing energy consumption decreases
growth and vice versa, and that increasing energy consumption increases growth, and vice versa,
and that this applies for both energy exporters and importers. Finally, there is a marked difference
in the cointegration relationship when country groups are considered.



This contribution investigates causal interdependence between energy consumption and economic
growth in Liberia and proposes application of a bootstrap methodology. To better reflect causality,
employment is incorporated as additional variable. The study demonstrates evidence of distinct
bidirectional Granger causality between energy consumption and economic growth. Additionally,
the results show that employment in Liberia Granger causes economic growth and apply
irrespective of the short-run or long-run. Evidence from a Monte Carlo experiment reveals that the
asymptotic Granger causality test suffers size distortion problem for Liberian data, suggesting that
the bootstrap technique employed in this study is more appropriate. Given the empirical results,
implications are that energy expansion policies like energy subsidy or low energy tariff for instance,
would be necessary to cope with demand exerted as a result of economic growth in Liberia.
Furthermore, Liberia might have the performance of its employment generation on the economy
partly determined by adequate energy. Therefore, it seems fully justified that a quick shift towards
energy production based on clean energy sources may significantly slow down economic growth in
Liberia. Hence, the government’s target to implement a long-term strategy to make Liberia a carbon
neutral country, and eventually less carbon dependent by 2050 is understandable.
Unlike previous energy consumption-economic growth studies, this study examines the relationship
among energy consumption, economic growth, employment and gross fixed capital formation for 17
highly developed OECD countries by employing both the Toda–Yamamoto procedure which based
on asymptotic critical values and the bootstrap-corrected causality test, since non-normality of the
error term harms the validity of the Toda–Yamamoto procedure. This study finds that there is very
small bias due to the assumption of normality. Furthermore using different information criterions,
importance of lag length is tested. Findings indicate that selection of lag length is important for
Denmark, Ireland, Norway and Spain. It is concluded that while there exists uni-directional causality
running from energy consumption to real GDP for Japan, bi-directional causality is found for Italy,
New Zealand, Norway and Spain. On the other hand, uni-directional causality from GDP to energy is
found for Australia, Canada and Ireland whereas no causal nexus is found for all of other nine
countries. Our analyses covering the sample periods imply that Japan, Italy, New Zealand, Norway
and Spain should not follow energy conservation policy at the aggregated level, since the reduction
of energy damages the economic growth.

The causal relationship between GDP and energy consumption is a well- studied topic for various
countries. This paper utilizes Johansen-Juselius Cointegration Methodology and Vector Error
Correction Modeling to analyze this relationship for Turkey. The results indicate a unidirectional
causality running from energy consumption to GDP. Thus, energy consumption positively affects
GDP. This suggests that a possible energy conservation program may harm economic growth in the
long run.

Energy plays a vital role in economic development. It performs a key for sustainable development.
Hence, many studies have attempted to look for the direction of causality between energy
consumption (EC), economic growth (GDP) and CO2 emissions. This paper, therefore, applies the
panel unit root tests, panel cointegration methods and panel causality test to investigate the
relationship between EC, GDP and CO2 emissions for 15 MENA countries covering the annual period
1973-2008. The finding of this study reveals that there is no causal link between GDP and EC; and
between CO2 emissions and EC in the short run. However, in the long run, there is a unidirectional
causality running from GDP and CO2 emissions to EC. In addition, to deal with the heterogeneity in
countries and the endogeneity bias in regressors, this paper applies respectively the FMOLS and the
DOLS approach to estimate the long-run relationship between these three factors.


This study is the first employing annual data for Turkey from 1970 to 2010 to examine the short and
long-run causal relationship between economic growth, electricity generation, exports and prices in
a multivariate model. According to the bounds test results, when electricity generation and
economic growth are the dependent variable there are two cointegrating relationships. According to
the results, long-run equilibrium relationship and long-term causality are found between economic
growth, electricity generation, export and price. Hence, in the short-run, there are bi- directional
causalities between economic growth- electricity generation, economic growth-export and
electricity generation-export with feedback effect.
The paper investigates the role of infrastructure in promoting economic growth in China using ARDL
and GMM techniques for the period 1975 to 2007. In this context, an attempt is made to
understand growth accounting equations to investigate the impact of infrastructure development
on output. Overall, the results reveal that infrastructure stock, labour force, public and private
investment play an important role in economic growth in China. More importantly, the study finds
that Infrastructure development in China has significant positive contribution to growth than both
private and public investment. Further, there is unidirectional causality from infrastructure
development to output growth justifying China's high spending on infrastructure development since
the early nineties. The experience from China suggests that it is necessary to design an economic
policy that improves the physical infrastructure as well as human capital formation for sustainable
economic growth in developing countries.

Energy is the basic support of China’s fast economic growth, industrialization and modernization,
but China has suffered from an energy shortage. We examine the role of energy development in
China, and then assess the effect that energy shortages have on economic development in the short-
term. We suggest some policies for energy saving and development in the long-term.


The paper investigates the long run relationship between energy use per capita and per capita real
gross domestic product (GDP) for 19 African countries for the period 1971–2001 using a newly
developed cointegration test proposed by [Pesaran, M. H., Shin,Y,&Smith, R. (2001). Bounds testing
approach to the analysis of level relationships. Jounal of Applied Econometrics, 16, 289–325], which
is capable of testing for the existence of a long run relationship regardless of whether the underlying
time series are individually I(0), I(1) or mutually cointegrated. The paper also uses the [Toda, H. Y., &
Yamamoto, T. (1995). Statistical inference in vector autoregressions with possibly integrated
process. Jounal of Econometrics, 66, 225–250] version of the Granger causality test which is valid
regardless of whether a series is I(0), I(1) or I(2), non-cointegrated or cointegrated of any arbitrary
order. The empirical evidence shows that there was a long run relationship between the two series
for only eight countries and causality for only 10 countries.


Several industrialized countries have signed the Kyoto Protocol, promising to reduce greenhouse
gasses (GHG) emissions. To reduce or mitigate such emissions several policies including reducing
energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency, decreasing energy intensity and forestation may
be possible. The viability and effectiveness of each policy may differ due to country specific factors.
This paper tries to assess the impact of a change in energy consumption on income and vice versa in
G-7 countries.We employ multivariate cointegration, error correction models and generalized
variance decompositions and uncover Granger causality relation between energy consumption and
income in all countries. However, the direction of causality seems to differ across countries. This
may suggest that although they are at the same level of economic development, different policy
alternatives in support of the protocol may be available in each country.
Energy arguably plays a vital role in economic development. Hence many studies have attempted to
test for causality between energy and economic growth; however, no consensus has emerged. This
paper, therefore, tests for causality between energy and GDP using a consistent data set and
methodology for over 100 countries. Causality from energy toGDPis found to be more prevalent in
the developedOECDcountries compared to the developing non-OECD countries; implying that a
policy to reduce energy consumption aimed at reducing emissions is likely to have greater impact on
the GDP of the developed rather than the developing world.

The objective of this paper is to examine the long-run relationship between output, pollutant
emissions, and energy consumption in Malaysia during the period 1971–1999. To supplement the
findings of cointegrating analysis, we assess the causal relationships between the variables using the
recent causality tests available in the literature. The results indicate that pollution and energy use
are positively related to output in the long-run. We found a strong support for causality running
from economic growth to energy consumption growth, both in the short-run and long-run.

This study utilizes U.S. annual data from 1949 to 2006 to examine the causal relationship between
energy consumption and real GDP using aggregate and sectoral primary energy consumption
measures within a multivariate framework. The Toda–Yamamoto long-run causality tests reveal that
the relationship between energy consumption and real GDP is not uniform across sectors. Granger-
causality is absent between total and transportation primary energy consumption and real GDP,
respectively. Bidirectional Granger-causality is present between commercial and residential primary
energy consumption and real GDP, respectively. Finally, the results indicate that industrial primary
energy consumption Granger-causes real GDP. The results suggest that prudent energy and
environmental policies should recognize the differences in the relationship between energy
consumption and real GDP by sector.
Departing from previous studies on the causal relationship between energy consumption and
economic growth, this paper illustrates how the finding of cointegration (i.e., longterm equilibrium
relationship) between these variables, may be used in testing Granger causality. Based on the most
recent Johansen's multiple cointegration tests preceded by various unit root or nonstationarity
tests, we test for cointegration between total energy consumption, real income, and price level of
two highly energy dependent East-Asian NICs: Korea and Taiwan. Nonrejection of cointegration
between variables rules out Granger noncausality and implies at least one way of Granger causality,
either unidirectional or bidirectional. Secondly, by using a dynamic vector error-correction model,
we then analyze the direction of Granger causation and hence the within-sample Granger
exogeneity or endogeneity of each of the variables. Thirdly, the relative strength of the causality is
gauged (through the dynamic variance decomposition technique) by decomposing the total impact
of an unanticipated shock to each of the variables beyond the sample period, into proportions
attributable to shocks in the other variables, including its own, in the multivariate system. Finally,
these response paths of shocks to the system are traced out using impulse response graphs. Results
based on these four dynamic tools of analysis broadly indicate that all three variables are
cointegrated and mutually causal. The Granger causal chain implied by our evidence tends to
suggest that although all these variables are endogenous (i.e., they all share the brunt of adjustment
to reestablish the long-term equilibrium), relatively in these two highly energy-dependent
economies, in line with expectations, it is the rate of price change that leads to the change in energy
consumption, which then leads on to the change in economic growth. Overall, shocks to the system

This paper empirically examined the causality between electricity consumption and economic
growth in two densely populated countries in South Asia, India and Pakistan. The causality analysis
was estimated at aggregated and disaggregated level where the focus of the analysis was on the
agricultural sector. The disaggregated causality analysis indicated a bi-directional causality between
the agricultural electricity consumption and the agricultural GDP in India, while in Pakistan the
causality was found to run from agricultural GDP to agricultural electricity consumption. At the
aggregated level, India confirmed conservation hypothesis while Pakistan confirmed feedback
hypothesis. From the public policy point of view, it can be inferred that, at the macro level, any
electricity conservation measures in India will not have an affect on India’s increasing economic
growth prospects and hence a policy-favourite supply-enhancement strategy in the form of
increasing electricity generation needs to be balanced with a demand-management strategy. In case
of Pakistan any such policy recommendation is difficult given the bidirectional nature of causality.
Taking into accounts for the dual role of energy in the demand and supply, this paper develops a
vector errorcorrection model (VECM) to test for the existence and direction of causality between
energy consumption and economic development in Malaysia. Using the Johansen cointegration
technique, the results indicate that the long-run movements of economic development, energy
price, the structure of economy, capital, labour and energy use in Malaysia are related by two
cointegrating vectors. Further, the results show that there is directional causality running from
economic development to energy consumption. Hence, an important policy implication of this study
is that energy saving would not harm economic development in Malaysia.


This paper offers an empirical evaluation of the output contribution of infrastructure. Drawing from
a large data set on infrastructure stocks covering 88 countries and spanning the years 1960–2000,
and using a panel time-series approach, the paper estimates a long-run aggregate production
function relating GDP to human capital, physical capital, and a synthetic measure of infrastructure
given by the first principal component of infrastructure endowments in transport, power, and
telecommunications. Tests of the cointegration rank allowing it to vary across countries reveal a
common rank with a single cointegrating vector, which is taken to represent the long-run
production function. Estimation of its parameters is performed using the pooled mean group
estimator, which allows for unrestricted short-run parameter heterogeneity across countries while
imposing the (testable) restriction of long-run parameter homogeneity. The long-run elasticity of
output with respect to the synthetic infrastructure index ranges between 0.07 and 0.10. The
estimates are highly significant, both statistically and economically, and robust to alternative
dynamic specifications and infrastructure measures. There is little evidence of longrun parameter
heterogeneity across countries, whether heterogeneity is unconditional, or conditional on their level
of development, population size, or infrastructure endowments.
As the world struggles to emerge from a global recession and financial crisis, countries are looking
for solutions to improve domestic economic performance and put people back to work. Global
energy demand and prices have been resilient during the recession, leading policy- makers in
countries with the potential to produce energy to look to that sector as a potential engine for
economic growth. The objective of this study is to undertake an empirical study on linkage samong
energy consumption, economic growth, FDI, relative price and financial development (i.e.,broad
money supply – M2) inlow income, middle income, high income non-OECD, high income OECD,
South Africa, Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and the aggregated at a of the World over a
period of 1975–2011. Data is analyzed by the Im–Pesaran–Shin (IPS) test of unit root to find out the
order of integration. The long-run relationship is investigated through the Pedroni [37] test of panel
cointegration. At last, the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) method is used for estimation of
the impact of growth factors on energy consumption in these regions. The results reveal that each
variable seem to have a unit root at level, so we could investigate cointegration of the series at
level. On the basis of Pedroni test, we can bring to a close that series are cointegrated. The results of
seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) suggests that GDP per capita has a positive impact on energy
consumption in low income, middle income, South Africa, MENA and aggregated at a of the World.
However, in high income OECD and non-OECD regions, there is no significant relationship been
found in both regions. FDI plays a pivotal role in increasing energy demand in middle income, high
income OECD and non-OECD region which implies that whatever other benefits may accrue from
FDI, it should not be expected to generate sufficient energy in South Africa, MENA and the World
directly. FDI enhancement policies should be supplemented to stimulate growth in those regions.
Broad money supply exerts positive impact on energy demand in low income, middle income, high
income non- OECD and MENA regions. Finally, relative prices has either a positive impact i.e.,middle
income region and / or a negative impact on energy consumption i.e., low income, high income
OECD and MENA region. The results conclude that low erenergy prices reduce input costs for nearly
all goods and services in the regions, thus making them more affordable.


This paper examines the relationship between natural gas consumption, economic growth and
capital by using G-7 countries data and a bootstrap-corrected causality test for the period
1970–2008. It was found eight significant Granger causality relationships. For Italy, the Granger
causality is from natural gas consumption to growth and United Kingdom adverse. For pattern of
France, Germany and United States there is two sided Granger causality between natural gas and
growth.
This paper applies the most recently developed panel unit root, heterogeneous panel cointegration
and panel-based error correction models to re-investigate co-movement and the causal relationship
between energy consumption and real GDP within a multivariate framework that includes capital
stock and labor input for 16 Asian countries during the 1971–2002 period. It employs the production
side model (aggregate production function). The empirical results fully support a positive long-run
cointegrated relationship between real GDP and energy consumption when the heterogeneous
country effect is taken into account. It is found that although economic growth and energy
consumption lack short-run causality, there is long-run unidirectional causality running from energy
consumption to economic growth. This means that reducing energy consumption does not
adversely affect GDP in the short-run but would in the long-run; thus, these countries should adopt
a more vigorous energy policy. Furthermore, we broaden the investigation by dividing the sample
countries into two cross-regional groups, namely the APEC and ASEAN groups, and even more
important results and implications emerge.

A recently developed methodology of the cointegration test is employed to determine whether
energy consumption has a long-run equilibrium relationship with the level of income or
employment. It is found that the long-run equilibrium relationship fails to exist in either case. The
finding implies a long-run neutrality of energy consumption, which is consistent with the short-run
neutrality found in the literature. The results are further confirmed by splitting the sample into two
sub-periods.
This paper examines the causality issue between energy consumption and GDP for South Korea and
Singapore, with the aid of cointegration and error-correction modeling. Results of the cointegration
and error-correction models indicate bidirectional causality between GDP and energy consumption
for both South Korea and Singapore. However, results of the standard Granger causality tests show
no causal relationship between GDP and energy consumption for South Korea and unidirectional
causal relationship from energy consumption to GDP for Singapore.


The Pacific Island countries are small island economies that are increasingly dependent on energy
for growth and development, yet highly susceptible to climate change. Thus, the relationship
between energy consumption and GDP is crucial for realizing their future development and growth
objectives. This article tests for Granger causality and provides long-run structural estimates for the
relationship between energy consumption, GDP and urbanization for a panel of Pacific Island
countries. For the panel as a whole in the long-run there is bidirectional Granger causality between
energy consumption and GDP and these variables exert a positive impact on each other. A 1%
increase in energy consumption increases GDP by 0.11%, while a 1% increase in GDP increases
energy consumption by 0.23%. The findings suggest that for the panel as a whole these countries
should increase investment in energy infrastructure and regulatory reform of energy infrastructure
to improve delivery efficiency, continue to promote alternative energy sources and put in place
energy conservation policies to reduce unnecessary wastage. These strategies seek to realize the
dual objectives of reducing the adverse effects of energy use on the environment, while avoiding
the negative effect on economic growth of reducing energy consumption.
Energy arguably plays a vital role in economic development. Hence many studies have attempted to
test for causality between energy and economic growth; however, no consensus has emerged. This
paper, therefore, tests for causality between energy and GDP using a consistent data set and
methodology for 30 OECD and 78 non-OECD countries. Causality from aggregate energy
consumption to GDP and GDP to energy consumption is found to be more prevalent in the
developed OECD countries compared to the developing non-OECD countries; implying that a policy
to reduce energy consumption aimed at reducing emissions is likely to have greater impact on the
GDP of the developed rather than the developing world.


This work adapts per capita income, energy demand (sub-group decomposed), inequality and
poverty frameworks in a simultaneous equations setting to investigate the role of energy sources on
per capita income, inequality and poverty in South Africa. It finds that energy sources (particularly
electricity and diesel) are important in estimating production functions. Gasoline, kerosene and coal
all exacerbate poverty, with the highest impacts on abject poverty. It is better to disaggregate
energy sources in order to capture resource-specific details. Redistribution efforts that focus on
reduction of between-group inequality can also moderate energy use since between-group
inequality tends to increase the demand for most energy sources. Public efforts are yielding fruits in
this direction and should be encouraged. Access to energy sources like electricity, diesel and gas are
crucial for productivity enhancement, but for them to yield significant anti-poverty fruits, efforts
must also target broadening capital access by the poor.


This study applies panel estimation techniques to investigate the long-run relationship between
energy consumption and GDP for a panel of 18 African countries (COMESA). In the first step, we
examine the degree of integration between GDP and energy consumption and find that the
variables are integrated of order one. We also investigate the long-run relationship between energy
consumption and GDP; our cointegration results provide strong evidence that GDP and energy
consumption move together in the long-run. On a per-country basis, FMOLS results reveal that
energy consumption has a positive long-run relationship with GDP. Finally, results from the panel
error correction model show no evidence of a short-run transitory relationship between GDP and
energy consumption; however, in the long-run, the error correction model captures a long-run
bidirectional relationship between energy consumption and GDP.
We apply recent panel methodology to investigate the relationship between electricity consumption
and real GDP for a set of 12 European Union countries using annual data for the period 1970-2004.
Recently developed tests for panel unit roots, cointegration in heterogeneous panels and panel
causality are employed. The results show a long-run relationship between the series. We estimate
this relationship and test for causality. We ¯nd no short-run causality in any direction. These results
might help to design appropriate electricity consumption policies in the sample countries, as well as
investment policies in interconnections to build a single European market for electricity.




This study investigates the causal relationship between clean and non-clean energy consumption
and economic growth in Brazil over the period of 1980–2009. Clean energy consumption at
aggregated level of total renewable energy consumption and disaggregated levels of hydroelectric,
new renewables, and nuclear energy consumption are tested within a production function
framework. A cointegration test reveals a long-term equilibrium relationship between real output,
capital, labor, and renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption at aggregated level, and a
long-term equilibrium relationship between real output, capital, labor, and hydroelectric/new
renewables/nuclear and fossil fuel energy consumption at disaggregated level. The capital, labor,
and new renewables elasticities of real output are positive and statistically significant, other energy
consumption item's elasticities are insignificant. The results from error correction model reveal the
interdependencies between new renewables, nuclear, fossil fuel, andtion by dividing the sample
countries into two cross-regional groups, namely the APEC and ASEAN groups, and even more
important results and implications emerge. root at level, so we could investigate cointegration of
the series at level. On the basis of Pedroni test, we can bring to a close that series are cointegrated.
The results of seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) suggests that GDP per capita has a positive

Understanding the impact of energy consumption on economic growth is an important
consideration in the formulation of both energy and environmental policies. Motivated by this
development, this paper empirically re-examines the direction of causality and the sign (in the panel
sense) between energy consumption (EC) and the gross-domestic product (GDP) for seventeen
selected Asian
countries. Results reveal long-run stable equilibriums in these countries, while the EC brings about a
positive impact on GDP. Causality runs from EC to GDP in the short-run, while the long-run causal
linkage exists from GDP to EC. This indicates that energy is a force for economic growth in the short-
run, but in the long-run, the EC is fundamentally driven by economic growth. Efficient coordination
and cooperation towards the implementation of energy conservation policies to support sustainable
economic development should be in the regional agenda.


The aim of this paper is to study the nature of the relationship between energy consumption and
economic growth in Cameroon through a three-step approach: (i) Study the stationarity of the
chronic, (ii) test of causality between variables and (iii) estimate the appropriate model. The study
concludes in a non-stationarity of the series. Using the data in first difference, the Granger causality
test yields a strong evidence for unidirectional causality running from OIL to GDP. Cointegration
tests also show that these two series are co-integrated and the Error Correction Model (ECM)
reveals that every percentage increase in Oil products consumption increases economic growth by
around 1.1%. This result confirms the intuition that an economic policy aimed at improving energy
supply will necessarily have a positive impact on economic growth. On the other side, a lack of
energy is a major bottleneck for further economic development in Cameroon.

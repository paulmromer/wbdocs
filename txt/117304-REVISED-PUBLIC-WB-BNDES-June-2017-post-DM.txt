1. Founded in 1952, the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) is a financial
entity fully owned by the Brazilian government. It is in the process of redefining its priorities and its role
going forward. New operational policies (OPs) published on January 5, 2017, mark an important
milestone. This report aims to contribute to the improvement of BNDES OPs and, more generally, provide a
medium- to long-term view of BNDES’ role in the Brazilian economy. It provides a conceptual framework to
establish BNDES as a development bank that aims to offset market failures that impose a wedge between
private and social rates of return and limit access to term finance. The framework differentiates credit-
constraining factors from the presence of externalities. The former might justify facilitating access to long-term
financing; only the latter might justify subsidies. The paper then applies the framework and methodology to
BNDES’ operations and finds that BNDES has in the past provided financing to many firms that have access to
alternative sources and subsidies beyond what could be reasonable in economic terms. The paper provides
recommendations to establish BNDES as a more effective and focused development bank, less dependent on the
government for funding, and less subject to interference by improving its governance.

    1. Criteria for Access to BNDES Resources

2. BNDES can help address certain market failures. Due to lack of market financing at reasonable terms,
firms may supply a socially insufficient amount of goods and services with high positive externalities. Some
firms, mainly SMEs, may be constrained in accessing term finance in view of informational asymmetries due to
their age (young); industry (high growth or under sharp transformation); nature (entrepreneurial, pioneering in a
domestic or export market, innovative); or type of activity (associated with a discovery process). In addition,
long-term finance may be limited due to macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty, which takes a particular
toll on SMEs.

3. However, the presence of a market failure does not necessarily imply the presence of an externality
that justifies subsidized lending. All externalities result from missing or thin markets. The reverse is not true:
Not all market failures imply an externality. Moreover, not all externalities justify subsidized lending.

4. Among credit-constrained SMEs, BNDES may better leverage its limited capital by targeting the most
progressive firms and growth-enhancing projects. This is particularly relevant in the context of a low-
productivity economy, with many firms (SMEs and others) clustered at the low-productivity end of the
distribution. BNDES may currently lack the right instrument mix to address the low-productivity conundrum (it
does not, for instance, provide technical assistance and consultancy). But this does not imply a need for across-
the-board and non-discretionary support for SMEs. In fact, many SMEs are relatively good risks, particularly
those in protected markets that have undergone marginal changes over the years. Insofar as they remain in the
market for a relatively long period, these firms should be relatively less constrained as more information about
them is available to banks and other financial institutions. In these cases, it does not seem reasonable to use
scarce public resources to support them. SMEs already benefit from friendly tax and related policies that may be
biasing firms’ growth decisions and BNDES may not want to reinforce such biases.

5. BNDES can build two separate decision streams, one to establish the eligibility of projects and the
other to determine which should receive subsidized funding (Figure 1). A well-defined methodology,
applied in a monitoring and evaluation framework, will be critical to improving resource allocation and
maximizing BNDES’ development impact.

      An externality stream to identify high-quality (well-designed, properly priced, and well-governed)
       projects with significant positive externalities that might justify subsidized BNDES credit. These
       resources should be allocated to well-defined areas or activities judged to bring measurable external
       gains and projects that pass the externality test.

      An additionality stream to identify strong projects from eligible firms that justify BNDES support
       at (notional) market rates, reflecting BNDES’ cost of funds as it issues bonds and taps capital
       markets. The additionality test attempts to answer the counterfactual: In the absence of BNDES, how
       would the firm finance the project? What alternatives are available? This would lead to a selection of a
       subset of projects by firms without access to long-term finance due in particular to information
       asymmetries. Typically, these would be young, high-impact firms in terms of sale and employment
       growth, with limited borrowing capacity due to a short track record. BNDES would provide access to
       term finance for such firms at market rates. The filter would exclude older, family-owned, low-growth,
       and relatively low productivity firms, and those clustering in mature sectors. Most of these firms would
       have access to at least moderately competitive market alternatives, making BNDES intervention
       unnecessary.

6. In addition, BNDES may wish to develop targeted, industry-specific programs to address coordination
externalities. Coordination failures may be of a nature that requires a dedicated program. For example,
individual projects in the sector – even though potentially highly meritorious – may remain non-viable because
they depend on the presence of an ecosystem (as in the case of the health services/neglected diseases drug
cluster). In these cases, a program fostering coordination may be effective. For an intervention of this nature to
                                                        7
be well-grounded, such industries would need to be potentially competitive. The program can involve a
proactive role for BNDES in designing public-private compacts to address coordination externalities plus the
provision of technical assistance and consultancy services directly or with the support of other entities.

   2. Instruments

7. With capacities on par with other significant development banks, BNDES has most of the instruments
required to carry out its mandate, but it relies mainly on lending operations. Among other products,
BNDES offers capital market operations and investments in externally managed funds by BNDESPAR. The
main reason for the strong preference for regular lending operations is the access to low-cost TJLP funding,
which provides a substantial subsidy relative to market rates. In addition, the transfers from FAT that BNDES
receives on a quasi-automatic basis create a strong inertia that may push BNDES towards an overly
“conservative? asset portfolio.

8. Guarantees are sparingly employed in direct operations, while warranties – though available – have
been left dormant for over a decade. Thus, BNDES is not “leveraging? its funds effectively. In its indirect
operations, BNDES utilizes a guarantee fund (FGI) geared toward supporting SMEs borrowing BNDES funds
from second-tier institutions. As market rates become dominant, third-party funding will become more
prevalent, and products such as guarantees – if correctly priced – will become a normal complement to credit,
mainly in view of the fact that increasingly younger, high growth progressive firms will be the ones risked out
of the market. In this case, guarantees might be the preferred instrument Further, when the choice of instrument
is not regular loans, it would strongly enhance BNDES’ ability to use instruments that leverage third-party
funds. The aim of BNDES would be to address market failures by developing financial solutions that crowd-in
private sector players.

9. The outstanding missing element in BNDES’ portfolio of services is technical assistance and
consultancy. BNDES has significant staff, mostly well-trained and sufficiently competent to provide solid
consultancy and assistance. It could be instrumental in combining finance and technical assistance to
subnational governments, which generally have a deficit of competence at the technical level to address the
challenges of designing and effectively deploying new projects. For SMEs, it might be more efficient for
BNDES to coordinate with other government institutions that provide such services (such as SEBRAE and
APEX).

   3. Funding of BNDES

10. Over the medium term, BNDES needs to shift away from an excessive dependence on FAT
constitutional transfers and issue bonds to build a yield curve, while strengthening its capital base to
allow for greater use of guarantees. By issuing bonds, BNDES will be able to establish a yield curve of
notional market rates. This would provide the basis for what BNDES charges for most of its loans, with TJLP
used parsimoniously. This process will gain traction with macroeconomic normalization, lower nominal and
real policy rates, and the shift in BNDES operational policies to charging market rates as a rule. BNDES would
offer what is truly scarce: guarantees and long-term credit for deserving credit-rationed firms.
                                                       8
11. Tapping domestic and international capital markets has multiple advantages . First, it shifts the
pressure away from fiscal sources at a time when Treasury transfers are (for now) eliminated. Second, and
conversely, the quasi-automatic nature of FAT constitutional transfers constitutes an incentive for BNDES to
use TJLP beyond what might be economically grounded. Third, capital markets provide BNDES with access to
a very large pool of resources; issuing bonds of different maturities allows it to build a yield curve, providing a
BNDES-specific (and realistic) notional market rate that will allow BNDES to correctly price its loans. In fact,
SELIC is a poor substitute for the market rate, especially when BNDES has the means, ability, and reputation to
calculate its true opportunity cost. It is against this opportunity cost that all current and future operations should
be measured in establishing the cost to BNDES, and to the country, of BNDES´ operations. Finally, and
possibly most important, an adequate pricing of BNDES loans and a far less elastic supply of subsidized
resources will serve as a powerful tool – and incentive – to reassess BNDES products and programs, their costs
and benefits, and the extent to which such a complex structure is needed to attain BNDES ends. A more focused
bank, in turn, will likely allow for a lower spread and a more competitive cost to the borrower, consistent with
overall market conditions.

Thus, over time, with the resumption of growth and investment, BNDES will be in a position to respond to new
demands to the extent that it can tap market resources while changing its liability structure to accommodate
greater use of guarantees and related products which would need to be funded with equity or grants. At the same
time, below-market rate lending will be progressively scarcer, a reflection of a stricter fiscal regime that will
impose additional requirements to ensure that credit and other subsidies are rationed effectively.

   4. Provision of Finance for Infrastructure

12. BNDES has an important role in providing finance for infrastructure by leveraging its resources and
crowding-in the private sector:

      First, BNDES could assume a catalytic role in bringing resources from institutional investors into public
       infrastructure in the form of PPP contracts. BNDES should select a financial vehicle that initially can
       attract the interest of the large long-term investors, with the aim of attracting international investors in
       the medium run. The use of standardized debentures that provide guarantees during the construction
       period and pay interest during the life of the bond may prove effective in attracting a massive amount of
       private resources to the financing of public infrastructure.
      Second, BNDES can support the development of the private debt securities market by ensuring that
       concessionary companies looking for its support access capital markets by issuing private papers.
       BNDES could provide credit enhancements on loan securitizations or undertake a supportive role as
       medium-sized firms issue corporate bonds.
      Third, BNDES can assume a leading role in syndicating loans (as IFC has done historically) and
       promoting financing structures with efficient risk allocations among stakeholders (sponsor, financiers,
       and insurers). The introduction of project financing will be essential to ensure broad participation of
       domestic and international concessionary companies.

13. BNDES support for the PPI – the Infrastructure Investments Program – needs better targeting. The
program offers positive substantive and procedural points, which support continuing involvement of BNDES in
                                                          9
financing the sector. The use of subsidized finance should be parsimonious and strictly related to the presence
of significant sectoral externalities, such as urban mobility, water/wastewater disposal, treatment/solid waste
disposal and utilization, and renewable energy. Even in these instances, the externality test should be applied to
ensure a clear rationale for implicit or explicit subsidies.

   5. BNDES Governance

14. BNDES governance can be improved by enhancing the effectiveness of its board. Statutorily, the board
only provides guidance (orientação superior), which has allowed significant government interference in
BNDES policies and operations. The federal government holds 100% of the shares and appoints all 12 board
members. International good practices suggest effective diversity of the board, with the presence of highly
qualified and vocal independent members. This could be accomplished with a change of the BNDES statute
along the lines of the efforts to improve governance at Petrobrás and Eletrobrás.

15. The presence of minority shareholders may further improve BNDES governance. The government
may want to invite other first-rate development banks (multilateral or even bilateral) to capitalize BNDES and
dilute the union – up to say a 25% share of the capital. This strategic change would represent a step toward a
more balanced board, with representatives of shareholders and independent members, both domestic and
international, committed to modernizing BNDES following best corporate practices in terms of governance,
management, and operations. This move would provide BNDES with the guarantee that management will
continue to have a mandate to pursue long-term development goals, with a focus on the more severe credit and
capital market failures that hamper the Brazilian economy.

I. An Overview of BNDES
Introduction

16. Founded in 1952, the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) is a financial entity
fully owned by the Brazilian government.2 BNDES is subordinated to the Ministry of Planning, Development,
and Management, with a mission to foster sustainable and competitive development, generating employment
while reducing social and regional inequalities. BNDES’ operational autonomy has at times been adversely
impacted by political interference.

17. In the 1950s and 1960s, BNDES played a key role in financing the country’s infrastructure. In the
following two decades, its emphasis shifted to support Brazilian industry. Since the 1990s BNDES efforts have
targeted infrastructure and industry, while supporting SMEs mostly through second-tier institutions. At the
same time, BNDES also finances innovation, and manages an important fund to contain deforestation and
promote sustainable development in the Amazon region.

18. BNDES is the major supplier of long-term financing in the country, mostly in the form of credit. It also
offers equity (and quasi-equity) instruments and, in some special cases, grants. According to the Central Bank
of Brazil, BNDES provided approximately 70% of long-term bank credit (defined as loans with over three-year
repayment period) during 2013-15. In November 2016, the average maturity of new loans from “free? or non-
directed resources was 38 months, compared with 100.5 months for BNDES and 177.9 months for directed
credit operations as a whole. In 2015 alone, BNDES disbursed R$135.9 billion in 954,208 operations for
221,114 clients.3 In the first half of 2016, disbursements stood at R$40.1 billion, a decline of 42% from the
same period in 2015. Disbursements reached a record in 2013-14, and they have since declined due to fiscal
retrenchment on the supply side and the continuing recession on the demand side.

19. By company size, disbursements to large firms (by BNDES definition) reached 60.3% in the first half of
2016, compared to 65% in the same period 2015. The decline is a result of an attempt to progressively shift
BNDES loan portfolio to firms that in principle have more limited credit access. During the first half of 2016,
BNDES carried out 324,426 transactions, with more than 96% of them directed to micro, small, and medium
enterprises (SMEs). Most transactions (243,000, or 74.9%) were undertaken with the use of BNDES credit
cards and corresponded to disbursements of R$3.3 billion (8.2% of total disbursements).




2
  BNDES has three subsidiaries: BNDES Participações (BNDESPar), which undertakes capital market transactions, mostly in the form
of equity and quasi-equity contributions to firms (see Annex 6 for a detailed description); FINAME, which comprises different
products (and credit lines) that fund the acquisition of machinery, equipment, and other capital goods; and BNDES Limited, which
finances the internationalization of Brazilian firms.
3
  See Annex 1 for basic BNDES statistics: financial highlights; key ratios; loan structure and disbursement patterns; credit risk policies;
and equity portfolio.
                                                                    14
BNDES support modalities

20. At the end of 2016, and prior to the new 2017 operational policies, BNDES offered 10 so-called products
and managed 40 programs and 10 funds.4

       Products finance eligible firms, items, activities, industries or sectors under a set of general rules, with
        the support of varied types of credit lines under pre-specified conditions (such as interest rate and
        payment term). In some cases, the rules are non-discriminatory; in most instances, however, BNDES
        offers more affordable terms for SMEs. Some products are for the exclusive use of SMEs.

       Programs are supposed to be temporary support mechanisms for specific sectors, although many have
        not been discontinued after their expected life.

       Funds offer further options for financial support to clients and beneficiaries, may have individual
        statutory or legal bases, and are governed by their own rules.

21. BNDES is a wholesale bank, with no branches and limited capillarity. As a result, it operates to a
significant degree (over 42% of its loan portfolio as of mid-2016) through a network of second-tier accredited
financial institutions (Graph 1.1), with most Brazilian banks offering BNDES products (on-lending or indirect
operations).

* Net of allowances for loan losses
22. BNDES’ indirect operations (on-lending) have certain obvious advantages in terms of capillarity gains as
well as some drawbacks. Commercial banks access inexpensive BNDES funds and charge “what the market
will bear? risk premia that might not necessarily reflect the underlying transaction risk.5 BNDES does not have
programs in place to evaluate and measure the impact on beneficiary firms of its on-lending operations.

4
 Annexes 2, 3, and 4 present a summary of BNDES’ products, programs and funds, respectively.
5
 If rents are being made in the process of on-lending funds from BNDES, the auctioning of such funds to accredited institutions
should be considered as a means to exhaust such rents (see section IV).
                                                                 15
BNDES funding

23. BNDES has access to below-market funding resources, which allow it to offer subsidized loans.6 Funding
sources include loans from the National Treasury (such transfers were discontinued in 2015) and
constitutionally mandated transfers from the Fundo de Amparo ao Trabalhador (FAT). In addition, BNDES has
in the past issued debentures and other instruments, and borrowed internationally, mostly from multilateral
institutions. Still, as of mid-2016, 84% of BNDES funding came from the Treasury and FAT (Tables 1.1 and
1.2).

  Funds from the National Treasury and FAT (and PIS-PASEP) is provided at a below market rate called the TJLP ( Taxa de Juros de
Longo Prazo). The Central Bank policy rate (SELIC) serves as the benchmark for the country’s private credit markets. The difference
between SELIC rate and TJLP is an indication of the magnitude of subsidies provided by BNDES. See Annex 5 for further details.

24. Due to both their cost and volume, the most significant and controversial of the incoming flows were from
the Brazilian Treasury. This practice began in earnest in 2008 and ended in 2015 (see Graph 1.2), but the fiscal
costs and economic consequences will be felt for many years to come. Two point are worth noting: (i) the large
wedge between Treasury´s borrowing costs (SELIC, at 10.25% end May 2017) and the basic rate in most
BNDES lending operations (TJLP, at 7%) and (ii) the sheer volume of these transfers (the mid-2016 BNDES
Treasury liability constituted more than 8.7% of GDP).




                                                                17

25. The use of subsidized Treasury financing to fund BNDES generated substantial distortions. First, the fact
that Treasury had to issue new debt to finance these transfers ended up increasing the level and cost of public
debt, potentially pushing up interest rates, increasing Treasury borrowing costs as well as costs for other
financial system agents. Second, the growing extent of subsidized credit impervious to changes in monetary
policy became an impediment to the central bank carrying out its mandate in full. Finally, the massive Treasury
transfers to BNDES and across-the-board subsidized lending led to poor investment decisions and no significant
productivity gains, with private agents borrowing at negative real interest rates, replacing internally generated
funds which otherwise would be directed to investment (often reassigned to dividends) and in a number of
instances leading to investing in equipment with limited economic rationales.7 Capital misallocation was not an
exception.

26. At the same time, BNDES’ relatively easy access to resources translated into a very limited use of capital
markets as a funding source, which could have had several advantages. Raising funds in the capital market
would allow BNDES to play a more effective development role, establishing the effective opportunity costs of
its funds, stimulating TJLP to be used parsimoniously. With an appropriate transition period, this process will
gain traction with macroeconomic stabilization, lower nominal and real policy rates, and the shift in BNDES
operational policies to charge market rates as a rule.

BNDES assets

27. Fundamentally, loans, securities, cash, and equity investments comprise BNDES assets (Table 1.3). The
non-performing loan ratio is quite low – 1.38% as of June 30, 2016, with 2.45% for direct operations and a
negligible 0.003% for repasses interfinanceiros, or credit operations with second tier financial institutions.8

  See, for instance, M. de Bolle, “Do Public Development Banks Hurt Growth? Evidence from Brazil,? Petersen Institute Development
Economics Policy Brief, September 2015; M. Bonomo, R. Brito, and B. Martins, “The After Crisis Government Driven Credit Expan sion
in Brazil: A Firm-Level Analysis,? Journal of International Money and Finance 55 (2015) 111-134.

  Information on non-performance rates for indirect or second-tier operations is not publicly available.
                                                               18
These low rates are consistent with the practice of BNDES asking for considerable collateral in its operations
and offering subsidized credit – it stands to reason that other financial institutions would be affected first. Still,
the presumption behind the stability in the quality of its portfolio is that economy does not deteriorate further.9
Similarly, BNDES’ equity investments depend on the state of the economy, although they are highly
concentrated in Petrobrás (38.5% of the total) and therefore depend heavily on its recovery under new and
improved governance and management.

Technical assistance and coordination with other public entities

28. In emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), BNDES stands out as one of the largest
development banks (along with the China Development Bank), and its toolbox contains at least as many
instruments as its counterparts. One exception is the unavailability of technical assistance and consultancy
services, which could be partly offset with improved coordination and communication with other institutions in
Brazil that offer such services (e.g. SEBRAE, APEX, and the S-System organizations). This gap may at times
constrain BNDES effectiveness mainly with respect to SME support (the focus of SEBRAE activities), exports
(APEX centers its efforts in export promotion for SMEs), and technology upgrading (industry-led SENAI
having a significant role, particularly within the business managed S-System).

 In fact, recession affected in a considerable way BNDES loan portfolio. Between June 2015 and June 2016, the amount of
renegotiated credit operation increased over sevenfold – from R$2,299 billion to R$16,366 billion, or 4.438% of BNDES’ loan
portfolio for non-financial entities.
                                                                19
29. A separate but related issue facing BNDES is the operational overlap with other public sector banks and
related institutions. These include Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF), and FINEP (which
finances scientific research, technology development, and innovation) as well as the regional development
banks, particularly Banco do Nordeste and Banco da Amazônia (financing firms in the Northeast and in the
statutorily defined Amazon region, respectively). Many of these institutions went through a phase of
government-mandated rapid growth, and they are now undergoing adjustment. In a number of ways, changes in
BNDES operational policies cannot ignore the policies and practices of those institutions. At the same time, it
should not be dependent upon them to make BNDES more effective as a development bank, while over the
medium to long term some consolidation of these functionally overlapping public sector institutions would
make good sense.

Reforming BNDES’ operational policies

30. In recent years, two issues have adversely affected the image of BNDES and prompted a review of its
operational policies (OPs).10 These include:

        The PSI “investment support? program, no longer in operation, but which left a significant and
         controversial legacy. The program aggressively disbursed resources at highly subsidized rates, often
         with no gains in terms of investment and economic efficiency. Funded by Treasury resources, it vastly
         expanded BNDES balance sheet, with credit extended through direct and indirect operations. Regarded
         by some in BNDES as being “imposed? by the previous government, the PSI’s economic and fiscal
         costs in all likelihood far outweigh its benefits.

        The widespread use of TJLP in BNDES products and programs, even when there is no apparent
         justification. BNDES supported firms clearly able to access credit from banks and resources from capital
         markets. Yet, the use of TJLP raises other questions. Even with additionality, is BNDES offsetting a real
         market failure? And what is its nature? What types of firms, activities, and industries should BNDES be
         targeting? How can BNDES better leverage its limited resources?

31. BNDES is in the process of redefining its priorities and its role going forward. OPs published on January 5,
2017, mark an important milestone. This report aims to contribute to the improvement of BNDES OPs and,
more generally, provide a medium- to long-term view of BNDES’ role in the Brazilian economy. The next
section presents a conceptual framework to establish BNDES as a development bank that aims to offset market
failures that both impose a wedge between private and social rates of return, and limit access to term finance.
The framework differentiates credit-constraining factors from the presence of externalities. The former might
justify facilitating access to long-term finance, by providing credit and increasingly guarantees; only the latter
might justify subsidies. In sections 3 and 4, the paper applies the framework and the associated methodology to
BNDES’ operations and finds that BNDES has in the past been providing finance to many firms that have
access to alternative sources and granting subsidies beyond what could be reasoned in economic terms. In
section 4, the paper provides recommendations to establish BNDES as a more effective and focused

development bank, less dependent on the government for funding and less subject to interference by improving
its governance. Section 5 draws the main conclusions.

II.     The Basis for BNDES Lending: A Conceptual Approach
32. As a development bank, BNDES faces the challenge of defining, through its operational policies and
screening processes, why a specific firm, project, or industry should be supported.

Market failures

33. The first justification for BNDES lending relates to market failures, particularly those affecting firms’
ability to borrow long term at competitive rates. In low-savings environments or where the savings-to-
investments channels are clogged due to policy, institutional, or economic barriers, credit markets may be
missing or might be too thin to respond to demand, giving rise to credit rationing.

34. Credit rationing in Brazil is in large part a product of macroeconomic imbalances and instability as well as
policy and regulatory measures that distort savings and credit markets.11 In addition, firms are credit-
constrained due to classic lender-borrower informational asymmetries and, arguably, limited competition in the
banking sector.12

35. To design effective BNDES interventions, it is important to have a better understanding of why markets
fail. What distortions increase transaction costs and impede those markets from existing or functioning
efficiently? Do these distortions affect primarily credit markets? How important is credit rationing? The cause
of the market-failure has important implications for identifying the type of firms BNDEs should support and the
choice of instruments, with the latter affecting the risk profile of BNDES and its risk management functions.

36. Assuming the scarcity of long-term credit (and guarantees) is a first-order problem, does it hold for firms of
all sizes, across all sectors and types of projects? To address this question, we use the additionality test and
answer the counterfactual: What would happen in the absence of government (BNDES) intervention?13

One possible reason for the shortage of long-term funding in Brazil is that private financial intermediaries (and
hence their clients) cannot access sufficient long-term funding (which is the traditional justification for
development banks existence). Note that in this case even mature firms can be credit-rationed and hence
virtually all firms could pass the additionality test. An alternative reason has to do with the risk associated with
long-term lending14. With high macroeconomic and institutional uncertainty (including weak contract

Financial Intermediation Costs and Credit Allocation,? World Bank Finance & Markets Global Practice, Draft Discussion Paper, August
15, 2016.
12
   See, for example, Leonardo S. Alencar, “Revisiting Bank Pricing Policies in Brazil: evidence from loan and deposit markets,? Banco
Central do Brasil, Working Paper Series 235, March 2011.
13
   According to Sergio Lazzarini et al, “What state-owned development banks do? Evidence from Brazil , 2002-2009? in World
Development No. 66:237-253, subsidized loans extended by BNDES in 2002-09 were not going to companies facing financial
constraints or having difficulties obtaining market financing.
14
   In most emerging markets the traditional funding rationale for a development bank is no longer present or is the wane, and hence
development banks are reforming their operations. Such a transition is also being observed in Brazil insofar as BNDES seems able to
develop a yield curve and fund itself in capital markets, as are large private banks and firms.
                                                                 21
enforcement), lenders shift the burden of risk to borrowers by issuing short-term credit (exposing borrowers to
roll-over risks) with a view to reduce risk of changes on borrowers default probabilities. In this case, BNDES
should increase its guarantee programs as opposed to the provision of funding, so as to address a market failure
related to the inability of financial intermediaries to diversify away from and mitigate unquantifiable risk (i.e.,
uncertainty).

37. It may be assumed that long-term finance, particularly for SMEs, is indeed unavailable, scarce or very
costly when available.15 At the same time, there may be no alternative other than a second-best BNDES
intervention – in the form of credit and increasingly guarantees - because of the difficulties arising from
informational or other “distortions? leading to high transaction costs that thin out long-term credit markets.

38. None of this implies that BNDES should lend on a subsidized basis.16 In other words, the fact that certain
markets fail does not necessarily mean the presence of an externality that might justify subsidized lending. All
externalities result from missing or thin markets. The reverse is not true: Not all market failures imply or are a
byproduct of an externality.

39. Thus, BNDES might be justified in acting as a substitute for quasi-missing long-term credit markets based
on firms’ inability to raise financing due to significant economy-wide uncertainty and/or firm or project-specific
information asymmetries. If BNDES can raise funds on a competitive basis in terms of cost and duration and
on-lend them at notional market rates17 (plus a del credere and a correctly priced risk premium), the institution
would be fulfilling an important development role. Resources being finite, BNDES might give preferences to
firms with certain characteristics – young, fast growing, entrepreneurial, innovative, entrants in emerging
sectors or export markets – that would be screened out of the private market for lack of a track record. Older,
slow-growing firms, incumbents in traditional sectors – even if credit constrained – might not justify being
supported by BNDES (although it is important to recognize the positive transaction costs of targeting firms with
certain desirable characteristics).18




15
   In fact, SMEs are on average more credit constrained, and for them additionality is easier to show. This is one reason why many
development banks focus on SMEs.
16
   In “The Role and Impact of Development Banks? (mimeo, July 2016), Aldo Musacchio, Sergio Lazzarini, Pedro Makhoul , and Emily
Simmons indicate that “the average interest rates charged by development banks are largely in line with the rates in the dome stic
markets?, 10-year bond yields, “the best proxy for long term lending rates?. They also find that “in Brazil, [t]he average rate charged
by BNDES is significantly below long-term market rates, reflecting heavy government subsidization. While in the other selected
countries (Chile, Canada, Germany, Korea and, China) we note that the development banks’ interest rates are slightly above the
bond yields? (p. 33).
17
   Such notional market rates (provided, for instance, by BNDES ’ long-term bond yield curves) would translate into a deep discount
from what would be potentially available in the market if a firm attempted to borrow long-term from a private financial institution.
BNDES would be using a mix of real and implicit guarantees of being a well-recognized government institution to access funds on a
competitive basis.
18
   See Marcela Eslava and Xavier Freixas, “Public development banks and credit market imperfections,? mimeo, May 31, 2016. The
authors show that underprovision of credit is more accentuated for high added value projects when commercial banks employ costly
screening technologies to make credit decisions. With proper corporate governance to avoid political targeting, a public
development bank should lend directly – and preferentially – to high value added firms (as opposed to SMEs, young firms etc.).
                                                                  22
Externalities

40. The second justification for BNDES lending is the presence of externalities. As noted, the fact that markets
fail – irrespective of the reason – does not imply externalities are present. Only when (positive) externalities are
demonstrably present, with a significant divergence between private and social rates of return, build a case for
subsidies to ensure the socially optimum level of output.

41. The “externality test? for BNDES lending is construed here as a multi-stage process. Stage 1 assesses
whether the project seeking funds commands an externality and its magnitude. Having determined externalities
are indeed present and significant, stage 2 inquires whether an alternative solution could be found – other than
lending, offering guarantees, or injecting equity – to cause production of this externality at a lower cost. Would
an intervention at the point of distortion – by another entity or even BNDES itself – allow addressing or
compensating for such externality? Because of the complementary nature of economic activities, would a
socially optimal level of output be produced irrespective of the intervention?

42. If not, then the issue is how to calibrate the subsidy in a way that the maximum gain is extracted at the least
cost. It is important not to succumb to the notion that practically any activity generates external economies that
would validate BNDES support. Credit subsidies should, by definition, be scarce; and BNDES must have the
instruments to ensure that only projects that are effectively eligible obtain them.

43. So far, we discussed the case for BNDES intervention in credit markets due to thin or nonexistent markets
or the presence of significant externalities. A particular case of an externality is a public good, characterized by
non-excludability (leading to the free-rider problem) and non-rival consumption (exclusion would actually be
inefficient). Not all externalities give rise to public goods – in fact, only a few do; however, all public goods
reflect the presence of an externality.19 Would this be sufficient to justify BNDES funding?

44. National defense and other classic public goods are in most countries financed by taxation or public debt.
To the extent that macroeconomic stability is a public good, however, BNDES’ countercyclical role could be
justified (as it was in 2009) on grounds that the state is able over time to diversify and smooth the risks
associated with extending credit in times of distress. Another relevant scenario for BNDES involvement would
be the experiment of a novel PPP administrative arrangement to increase the level of efficiency in delivering
public services. In this case, the rationale for BNDES support has to do with the potential innovation or novel
ways of the private production of a public good, with such innovation freely disseminated to other potential
providers.

Selecting beneficiary firms

45. What type of firms should BNDES be financing? Many, if not most, development banks focus on medium,
small and sometimes micro firms (SMEs). Establishing this priority rests on the view that a market failure
leaves the SMEs credit-rationed. But why would credit (and related) markets fail in case of SMEs and constrain
their access to finance? Fundamentally, the problem is asymmetric information. This would lead to an inability
of the lender to correctly assess risk-adjusted expected returns. The presumption behind the hypothesis of

19
 See Kenneth Arrow, “Political and Economic Evaluation of Social Effects and Externalities,? in J. Margolis, The Analysis of Public
Output, NBER, 1970.
                                                                  23
asymmetric information is that borrowers know more than lenders about their true state, but they are unwilling
or unable to communicate to lenders, resulting lenders to undersupply credit.
46. Some of the firms’ characteristics might lead to this outcome despite relatively deep financial markets:

          The age of the firm or the markets to which they are catering. Younger, entrepreneurial firms, entrants in
           new sectors or export markets, with a lesser track record, obviously face greater informational
           constraints to signal their actual (and not perceived) risks. They are also firms that tend to be “high
           impact? in terms of growth and employment.

          The product or service the firm is launching (or developing) and its underlying technology. The process
           of discovery implies significant uncertainty regarding the viability of new products, services, and
           technologies under development or adoption. Pioneering firms in emerging industries typically have not
           generated enough information that would help assess their credit worthiness or viability.

47. Would older SMEs, incumbent in mature industries, using standard technologies, and producing “run-of-
the-mill? products and services for the domestic market – with a long history or a proven track record – face the
same information problem? Arguably not. In the market for many years, their financial and operational data are
less uncertain. They may still be credit-constrained and face unreasonable rates, especially in Brazil’s strongly
segmented credit markets, but ceteris paribus the obstacles aren’t as large. In principle, such firms would not be
as good candidates for BNDES on-lending – unless BNDES loans or guarantees were to encourage a structured
effort to improve productivity, introduce environmentally friendly (social) technologies, or gain a competitive
edge. Otherwise, BNDES would be contributing to the stacking up of less productive firms in the economy,
congealing capital in outdated activities (or older industries). During the transition period, however, there could
be a justification for continued support to, on average, less productive SMEs as well as support for labor-
intensive projects in poorer regions and urban agglomerates on the basis of positive social externalities.

48. Currently, approximately one-third of BNDES´ total disbursements are allocated to SMEs, fundamentally
on the basis of the size criterion, although a subset of those are also in targeted sectors or activities. SMEs are
supported under generous terms:20

          Financing cost of TJLP;

          BNDES spread of 1.5% generally, with a minimum of 1.2%;

          A risk premium for the first-tier or direct operations or a financial intermediation fee of 0.1% for
           second-tier or indirect operations, with the second-tier institution charging a freely negotiated risk
           premium according to its own risk assessment.

          An 80% maximum share of the project.

49. BNDES support is grounded on two different rationales:

          SMEs face a credit-rationed environment, and BNDES should compensate by facilitating access;

20
     See BNDES, “Políticas Operacionais – Resumo Executivo,? September 14, 2016.
                                                                24
        Second, SMEs command some type externality or a social benefit (not made explicit), which would
         justify an across-the-board credit subsidy for all SMEs, irrespective of their characteristics.

Neither case for support seems obvious.

50. There are certainly instances that justify subsidies to support firms with projects commanding significant,
measurable externalities on the presumption that, absent the subsidies, the firm would not produce a socially
valuable good or service – or at least not in the amounts desired. Yet, this conclusion requires caution.
Moreover, it is far from clear that the presence of SMEs per se generate positive external benefits. If this cannot
be shown, BNDES operational policies regarding SMEs seem to be erring by providing unwarranted subsidies.

51. To offset limited access, BNDES would fill the gap with guarantees or credit in amounts and durations
demanded by bona fide agents shut out of the market. Credit guarantees may be a better instrument if the credit
rationing reflects economy-wide uncertainties or informational asymmetries. BNDES rarely makes use of
guarantees, and credit and guarantees clearly are not perfect substitutes. The support should reflect the fact that
rationing is typically for long-term credit.

52. BNDES should charge notional market interest rates, adjusted to reflect the operation’s risk. A missing
market may imply that a market rate cannot be observed; in this case, a notional rate must be established based
on BNDES’ market-funding costs. BNDES should ensure that it facilitates rather than undermines well-
functioning markets. Note that subsidies are not provided in well-managed microcredit market operations.
Interest rates reflect the risks and costs of operation, repayment rates are high, and pioneers in this market had
an important “discovery? and market development role.

53. BNDES does not have unlimited capital. Even if SMEs do face credit constraints, BNDES should give
priority to supporting firms with the most progressive, entrepreneurial-based, productivity-enhancing, and
growth-related projects. This is particularly relevant in the context of a low-productivity economy, with many
firms (SMEs and others) clustered at the distribution’s low-productivity end.21 BNDES might currently lack the
right instrument mix to address the low-productivity conundrum (it does not, for instance, provide technical
assistance and consultancy), but this does not seem to be a reasonable rationale for across-the-board, non-
discretionary support for SMEs.

54. Many SMEs that are relatively good risks, doing business in protected markets, undergoing only marginal
changes over the years, and being only moderately credit constrained. Insofar as they remain in the market for a
relatively long period, these firms should be relatively less constrained as more information about them is
available to banks and other financial institutions. SMEs already benefit from preferential tax treatment22 and
related policies that may be biasing firms’ growth decisions. BNDES may not want to reinforce such biases.



21
   See the presentation by Fernando de Holanda Barbosa at the BNDES Seminar “Indústria Brasileira: Desafio de Políticas para o
Aumento da Competitividade? (Roundtable 1), October 14, 2016. The author presents evidence that Brazilian firms are unusually
clustered at the low-end of the (labor) productivity spectrum. The “thick tail? suggests that tax and credit policies – among others –
may be allowing low-productivity firms to remain in the market for longer, constituting an exit barrier.
22
   The Simples tax system allows SMEs to combine different taxes (corporate income, social security, turnover, services) into a single
payment at a significant lower aggregate rate.
                                                                  25
55. For BNDES, transaction costs must also be an important consideration. They may be high enough to justify
non-discriminatory support for SMEs on efficiency grounds – using second-tier institutions in particular - on the
fair presumption that SMEs are the firm group that has greater propensity of being rationed out of the market. In
addition, there are many positive firm characteristics highly correlated with size that might justify tilting toward
SMEs to economize on transaction costs. For example, many entrepreneurial firms are SMEs during their high-
growth stage, and they face major constraints to access finance at a time when they may also require other types
of support (more often than not, management consultancy, marketing advice, product development assistance).
In this early stage, they also tend to generate significant employment growth and, if they are pioneers, produce
information that may attract other firms to an emerging industry. By the same token, many – if not most –
innovative firms are SMEs, and access to finance tends to be critical for them. BNDES may step in (including
through BNDESPAR), although market-based solutions (angel finance, VC funds) should at least complement
BNDES’ role.23 Finally, some type of support for SMEs might also be warranted on the basis of “equality of
economic opportunity,? a common rationale for SME support among development banks.

Selection of sector and industries

56. Having defined why a specific project should be financed, the types of firms that might be targeted, and the
relevance of size as a criterion, it is a germane question if a sector or an industry is an economically legitimate
object for BNDES support.

57. Historically, BNDES has been an important instrument for industrialization and promotion of specific
sectors. As an instrument of government policy, BNDES has since its beginning been involved in supporting
broad areas deemed important for Brazil’s economic development – for example, infrastructure at its genesis,
then the industrial sector in the 1970s. It was in the context of the Second National Development Plan (1974-79)
that BNDES began targeting in a systematic way the wholesale build-up of major product groups, such as
capital goods and intermediates.

58. The rationale for such action was grounded on the notion that the more capital- and knowledge- intensive
sectors could be construed as infant industries, with local industrialists facing steep entry barriers. BNDES´ role
was in some instances to support entry and expansion of firms as a means to substitute imports; in others, it was
to finance the purchase of goods produced domestically by entrants and/or incumbents (as in the case of
FINAME).24 To a great measure, BNDES has been an effective instrument of promotion and protection of
domestic industry and support for specific segments.

59. The concept of “effectiveness? might, of course, be challenged. After six decades of import- substitution
policies and four decades of active BNDES support, Brazilian industry appears to require continued support to
face competitors in the domestic market. Clearly, the infant industries aged and possibly so have the policies
and instruments that ultimately were not designed to bring firms closer to – and eventually push out – the
productivity and innovation frontier.



23
   As noted in Annex 6, BNDESPAR is a limited partner in 43 funds, including 14 of them geared toward innovation, nine for
infrastructure, and three for clean technologies.
24
   The capital goods industry was regarded as a center for the generation and diffusion of innovation.
                                                                26
60. BNDES does not make policy; however, it provides a menu of financial instruments to support government
policies. In lending and/or investing and setting the specific terms of each transaction, BNDES uses a number of
filters codified in its operational policies.

61. BNDES has 36 credit “lines,? which can be loosely defined as the means BNDES uses to adjust financing
terms and conditions to its priorities and guidelines. It offers 10 “products? that may rely on one or more credit
lines (for example, FINAME or BNDES Card). It has 40 structured programs offering different instruments to
suit borrowers’ needs and a number of “funds? with different financial conditions and access channels.25 The
funds have very distinct purposes, some meritorious and others questionable. The Amazon Fund, for instance,
uses resources from Nordic countries to address extremely relevant issues concerning deforestation and
sustainability in the Amazon region, working through NGOs and local governments. On an ex-ante basis, few
institutions in government appear as well-equipped as BNDES to host a fund of this nature. BNDES also
operates a well-regarded guarantee fund to support lending operations for SMEs (FGI). Other funds might raise
doubts – in terms of their objectives, time in operation, or the magnitude of their results.

62. Like many other development banks, BNDES offers better transaction terms as a way to target specific
types of activities and projects, certain types of firms, and increasingly important sectors. Any statement
regarding the appropriateness of a product or of a specific program would need a closer look at its rationale; i.e.,
what it is trying to achieve. In particular, a project should go forward only if the objective is feasible and fulfills
a development need, if the means supplied are what are effectively required to reach the stated goals, and if the
corresponding transaction passes a cost-benefit analysis.

63. The previous discussion established that BNDES would have legitimate reason to support activities or
projects that pass the externalities test. Under normal market conditions, firms would supply an insufficient
amount of certain goods and services with highly positive externalities. This is due to certain economic
characteristics that private financial markets fail to fully recognize, leaving these activities systematically
underfinanced. BNDES may also be justified in supporting firms that are credit constrained – thus passing the
additionality test – and face economy-wide uncertainties and sharp informational asymmetries the latter
typically due to their age (too young); industry (high growth or under sharp transformation); nature
(entrepreneurial, pioneering in a domestic or export market, innovative); or type of activity (associated with a
discovery process). These firms tend to be SMEs.

64. Can a similar rationale apply for a specific sector or industry? In other words, are there inherent
characteristics that justify their targeting – beyond the more obvious cases? For instance, enhancing the water
sector tends to be uncontroversial because of the substantial positive externalities associated with the production
and consumption of clean water and the disposal (and reuse) of wastewater. A strong case can also be made for
improving urban mobility by financing mass transportation systems. In energy, renewable and other low-carbon
emission projects are solid candidates. Reforestation, low-carbon agriculture, recycling, and industries with a
direct and significant link to sustainable development paths are supported by many governments, directly and/or
through development banks.

65. In perusing BNDES products, programs, and funds, such relatively clear-cut cases of high positive
externalities with strongly dominant social returns are less obvious.

66. In particular, BNDES programs have a set objective, a budget, a small staff to manage them, and a mission
to support specific industries. They are also time-bound in the sense that they are supposed to provide support
for a set period, lasting only until the targeted industry achieves maturity.

67. BNDES prides itself on what are perceived to be relatively successful programs, designed on the basis of
internal studies that pointed to both social and economic needs, and to market opportunities. However, not all
programs were generated internally. In BNDES’ portfolio, a number of programs were proposed by the
government, including the extraordinarily fiscally expensive PSI and all programs geared toward agriculture.
Most were motivated endogenously, such as ProFarma and ProSoft.26 Even so, they should all be subject to
periodic assessments.

68. Under what circumstances BNDES would be justified targeting a sector? Coordination externalities may be
so large that short of a “program? targeting a sector, individual projects in that sector – even though potentially
highly meritorious and well supported – would remain non-viable because they depend on the presence of an
ecosystem.

69. The case of BNDES Profarma is instructive. The Ministry of Health in Brazil is a major buyer of drugs for
the public health system (SUS – Sistema Único de Saúde), many to treat so-called neglected (tropical) diseases.
While the country has accumulated significant scientific and technological knowledge in this area, it is not yet a
cost-effective producer of drugs targeting those diseases. In this instance, BNDES seems to be playing
important roles through ProFarma: one is explicit, supporting in a coordinated way key components of this
segment; the second is implicit, providing a credible link between potential (government) demand from another
government entity (Ministry of Health) and a BNDES-supported latent competitive supply.

70. Obviously, this and other programs would need to be evaluated on their own merits to warrant continued
existence. Yet this program seems to illustrate the specific circumstances in which BNDES might be justified in
taking a programmatic approach.

71. The following conditions may be used as criteria to establish the economic rationality of targeting a specific
sector. It is likely that some industries currently supported would pass these sequential requirements; others
might not.

        First, the existence of fundamental endowments – in science, technology, human, and/or natural
         resources – that provides the grounds to supply domestic and/or foreign markets on a competitive basis.
         In the absence of such endowments, public (and eventually private) resources would go to waste.27
        Second, credible studies must show that demand captured by entrants would have the scale to sustain the
         targeted segment. Further, the studies should indicate that producers would attain a competitive standing


26
  See Section I, Annex 3 (“Main Current Programs?).
27
  An illustrative example where there appears to be a case of investing without respecting the endowment constraint is CEITEC, one
among a number frustrated initiatives to create a base for the production of integrated circuits (ICs) in a country notoriously short of
scientists and engineers in the area.
                                                                  28
           in a relatively short time, suggesting the relevance of offering time-bound – as opposed to open-ended –
           incentives.
          Third, it is critical to demonstrate that BNDES intervention is necessary to overcome coordination
           externalities among producers and/or between producers and buyers that would impede the emergence
           of the industry. Just as important, it should be shown that BNDES is uniquely equipped to address such
           externalities, credibly supported by complementary policy initiatives.
72. This section attempted to establish the economic foundations that provide the rationale for BNDES ’ role as
a development bank: market failures that result from missing (credit) markets or associated with significant
externalities. The implications for BNDES products and priorities and, more generally, the way it conducts its
business will be the subject of Section III.

III.       Applying Fundamental Economic Concepts to BNDES Operations
73. To establish the implications of the economic concepts and approach developed in Section II to BNDES
operations, it is important to initially define the objects of BNDES’ current support mechanisms. They are
fundamentally two:

          Firms that BNDES supports directly and through its second-tier financial agents with one or more
           products.

          Industries, some targeted directly by BNDES programs28 and indirectly by its products (by financing the
           acquisition of capital goods, for instance).

Assessing BNDES products

74. Each product was instituted on the basis of a certain logic or rationale. All implicitly presume that firms are
credit constrained.

75. An analysis of BNDES products shows that:

          A significant number – a large proportion of FINEM operations, FINAME in its three modalities
           (regular, agrícola, and leasing), BNDES Automático, BNDES Cartão – are offered though second-tier
           accredited institutions. What economically grounded filters do those institutions impose?

          BNDES operations tend to benefit large firms (as BNDES defines them), with the exceptions of Cartão
           BNDES, FINAME Agrícola, and the Não Reembolsável (grants). Is there evidence that such firms are
           effectively credit constrained? Or are they basically looking for and benefitting from a relatively
           inexpensive source of credit – as the literature has suggested?29



28
   There are also instances in which BNDES is an agent of a government fund targeting a specific sector, such as the support to the
shipbuilding industry provided by Fundo de Marinha Mercante (FMN).

                                                                 29
        BNDES offers quasi blanket subsidized credit on a fairly non-discriminatory basis.30 What is the
         possible rationale? It does not seem that most products offering subsidies are targeting projects and
         activities with large externalities. It should be pointed out, however that positive and significant
         externalities can be associated with firms of all sizes, being basically dependent on the nature of the
         activity undertaken or the project being financed.

76. As a development bank, BNDES aims to address key market failures in support of and complement to other
government policies. The section below offers a preliminary exercise in assessing BNDES key lending
activities and attempts to identify ways to enhance the bank’s operational policies.

A preliminary exercise in assessing lending activities

77. As noted in Section I, BNDES has a very significant role in development finance. To establish the
economic logic of BNDES lending, this paper adopts a simple strategy: It uses firm size as a proxy for the
degree of credit constraint, the premise being the smaller the firm, the more constrained it is. And it uses the
firm or the project’s sector as an indication of the presence of externalities. This is a simplification, but it serves
the purpose of establishing orders of magnitude when it comes to assessing BNDES operations.

78. From this perspective, it appears first, that most BNDES resources currently go to credit-unconstrained
firms31 – those that would have access to other alternatives in credit and capital markets (although, certainly,
some larger firms face long-term credit rationing to finance investment due – inter alia – to their risk profile). In
2015, BNDES lent mostly to large and medium-large firms, which combined received 73% of disbursements
(67% in the first half of 2016), with no demonstrable additionality. In contrast, micro and small firms absorbed
27% of disbursements (26.5% in the first half of 2016).

        SMEs tend to have a higher propensity to be credit-constrained. For the purpose of this assessment, it
         will be taken as a given that SMEs are indeed credit constrained, although lending is generally
         undertaken without sufficient information to establish the market failure that might justify BNDES
         intervention.

79. Second, BNDES resources seem to be directed to activities either with no clear externalities or still-to-be-
ascertained ones, with a smaller proportion to areas commanding significant externalities (see Annex Table
3.1). In 2015:

        Activities with identifiable externalities were responsible for 22.3% of total disbursements, adding to
         R$30.34 billion. These include water and sewage; health services and pharmaceuticals; education; arts,




30
   There is also a high degree of standardization that reduces BNDES ’ ability to charge a premium proportional to the risk posed by
the operation and the services that are being provided to borrowers, combined with a fairly narrow set of instruments, basically
tapping BNDES’ own resources.
31
   This paper uses two sources of data to assess BNDES lending: (i) yearly volume of disbursements and (ii) automatic and non-
automatic loan contracts. Volume of disbursements is the benchmark statistics for the banking business; however, contract level
data, with credit terms and investment projects’ descriptions for first tier and second non -automatic loans, allows for a more in-
depth analysis. Annex 8 provides detailed information about the database used in this paper.
                                                                  30
         culture and sports; urban mobility; low-carbon agriculture; renewable energies; innovation; and public
         administration.32

        Activities with “rule-of-reason? externalities (i.e., those needing to be ascertained) absorbed 28.6% of
         total disbursements (R$38.87 billion). Some of those activities might have significant external effects,
         others might not. All non-automatic operations disbursed in 2015 (1,301 projects), plus programs with
         clear externalities (such as low-carbon agriculture), were examined on a case-by-case basis, and relevant
         exceptions were picked out of the electricity and gas, transportation, agriculture, and fisheries sectors.

        Finally, activities with no clear externalities – including the extractive industries, oil and gas, commerce,
         services, among others – were responsible for the largest share of disbursements in 2015 at 49.1% (or
         R$66.73 billion).

80. Is there a discernible relation between degree of additionality (indicated by firm size) and levels of
externality? Table 3.1 presents an initial indication of the distribution of BNDES disbursements according to
both variables.

        Large and medium-large companies have the largest share of disbursements in activities with clear
         externalities – 90% of the total (R$27.2 billion). The share is reduced to 56% for activities with
         externalities to be ascertained (R$21.7 billion) and 72% for activities with no externalities in principle, a
         figure that matches the share in total disbursements (72%). Conversely, SMEs appear to show a
         somewhat lower propensity to engage in activities with significant externalities (Annex Table 3.1 has
         detailed information).

81. Third, BNDES loans (and grants) signed and contracted directly and indirectly (on a non-automatic basis)
in 2015 enable a project-by-project assessment,33 which makes it possible to assess whether new loans point to a


32
   A list of such sectors is found in Annex Table 3.3.
33
   BNDES database on automatic loans does not include the projects’ description, which would allow for a finer disaggr egation of the
firms’ activities. Only direct and indirect non-automatic loans have the projects’ description. Smaller firms tend to use automatic
loans.
                                                                 31
different pattern of disbursements, one more consistent with an institution bent on maximizing its development
impact (see Annex Table 3.1).

      Sectors or activities associated with significant externalities made up 39% of the total value of non-
       automatic loans signed;

      Sectors or activities with uncertain (rule-of-reason) externalities were responsible for 23% of the value
       of those loans; and

      Activities with no significant demonstrable externalities still corresponded to 38% of the value of non-
       automatic transactions.

82. The data suggest that BNDES lending rates are only partly linked to the presence of externalities for such
contracts (Annex Table 3.2).

      For economic activities with no demonstrable externalities, an estimated 50% of loans are indexed to
       TJLP, 15% are based on fixed rates (which vary widely), 18% are based on SELIC, 1% are grants, and
       16% are based on other indices.

      For rule-of-reason externalities, the distribution is 51% for TJLP, 1% for fixed, 20% for SELIC, 0% for
       grants, and 27% for other indices.

      For high externality activities, the distribution is 90% for TJLP, 0% for fixed, 6% for SELIC, 2% for
       grants, and 1% for other indices.

83. The amount of loans indexed to TJLP awarded to activities with no or low externalities (50%) seems
unwarranted. At the same time, only 19% of these loans are indexed to market-based SELIC, with 20% based
on other indices.

84. Two elements stand out in a first assessment of BNDES products:

      First, it is highly unlikely that most firms receiving BNDES support would be eligible on credit-
       rationing grounds. Resources are still steered towards large firms, which generally do not exhibit the
       characteristics of credit constrained firms. Even for products explicitly targeting SMEs, BNDES does
       not appear to employ filters capable of sifting through the data and arriving at the subclass most eligible
       to receive support.

      Second, it is even less likely that the vast majority of firms – SMEs, medium-large, and large – receiving
       credit subsidies would be eligible for such support on externality grounds. From this perspective,
       BNDES products are providing subsidies for too many firms. If the externality test were employed to
       filter activities and projects deemed worthy of BNDES backing, as suggested in Section II, only a
       limited number of firms and projects would in all probability justify subsidies.

85. BNDES Programs. The BNDES portfolio currently includes 40 programs (see Section I, Annex 3), some
targeting a given sector from a multiplicity of “angles? (for example, agriculture and agroindustry, or capital
goods and vehicles). Other programs focus on a cluster of activities (such as health); or have an industry-

                                                       32
specific emphasis, such as software, plastics, and paper. Finally, a few programs provide support for the
subnational public sector (states and municipalities), and others have an anti-crisis and countercyclical function.

86. A preliminary assessment of the programs shows:

        There are 15 programs supporting agriculture and agroindustry, only two of which appear to address
         significant externalities – namely, low-carbon agriculture and agriculture research, which combined
         absorb 10.2% of the pre-allocations (dotação) for agriculture. Note that 11 of the 15 programs offer
         loans indexed by TJLP.
        Innovation is the object of two additional programs, extending finance to SMEs (MPME Inovadora) and
         offering quasi-equity (THAI). In addition, eight other programs arguably command significant
         externalities: Profarma and Saúde in the health cluster; Procult for the creation and production of
         cultural goods; and Fundo Clima, targeting climate change.
        There are five countercyclical programs with R$21 billion pre-allocated and 10.6% of disbursements in
         2016, led by Progerem (for working capital). Other programs are Giro PSI Pró Caminhoneiro (working
         capital for beneficiaries of PSI loans for acquiring trucks), Pro CDD Cartão (to refinance BNDES credit-
         card borrowers), Micro e Pequena Empresa Pequeno Aprendiz (to support employment), and Programa
         de Incentivos à Revitalização de Ativos Produtivos (to promote the restructuring and transfer of viable
         assets).
        Three programs support subnational entities – Propae, PMAT Automático, and PER (directed to
         municipalities affected by natural disasters). Arguably, modernization of these entities is a legitimate
         priority because poor public sector management on top of significant fiscal constraints have a direct and
         material impact on the population’s economic welfare.
        Finally, 15 programs have various objectives, most of them targeting certain industries, such as plastics
         (Proplastico); consumer goods (Prodesign); paper (Propapel); software (Prosoft); capital goods (Pro BK,
         Procaminhoneiro, and Moderfrota, the latter a significant program which finances tractors, combines,
         and other vehicles directed to agricultural activities).

87. Is there an economic justification for supporting these industries? There are basically two arguments for
targeting an industry: first, infant industry grounds, or some derivative notion;34 second, significant externalities
constraining output. The latter includes either positive external economies that lead to differences in private and
social rates of returns, or the relatively less obvious coordination externalities.

        The concept of infant industry presupposes a time dimension. Support would be centered on young or
         emerging industries on the premise that the progressive acquisition of technological competences and/or
         learning-by-doing would drive costs down, allowing the industry (and most firms within it) to approach
         the frontier. Yet an examination of BNDES programs – with the possible exceptions of pharmaceuticals
         and software – disallow the presumption that these mechanisms can be justified on infant-industry
         grounds because most targeted sectors may be regarded as mature.


34
  For example, path dependence in activities characterized by myopia and increasing returns may “lock in? certain industries (and
countries), generating an “equilibrium? which fails to exploit their true potential comparative advantage. See the seminal papers by
Brian Arthur (1985) and Paul David (1985, 1986).
                                                                 33
        The need for BNDES to intervene to ensure that industry-wide coordination externalities are
         internalized could justify a program targeting an emerging industry. It would be hard to go beyond the
         health-related cluster and possibly – at an earlier stage – the software industry to find a potential
         demand-supply disconnect or the imperative of establishing an ecosystem for the industry to flourish.35

Developing an externality and an additionality decision stream

88. BNDES can build two separate decision streams to (i) establish the eligibility of projects and (ii) determine
whether they should receive subsidized funding. A well-defined methodology, coupled with a monitoring and
evaluation framework, will be critical to improving resource allocation and maximizing the development impact
of BNDES.

        An externality stream to identify high-quality (well-designed, properly priced, and well-governed)
         projects with significant positive externalities might justify subsidized credit from BNDES. These
         resources should be allocated to well-defined areas or activities judged to bring measurable external
         gains and pass the externality test.

89. Not all firms or projects bring significant positive external effects. This section established an initial
classification to assess what proportion of loan values signed in 2015 are directed to firms in sectors or areas
where externalities are arguably significant. The analysis indicated that BNDES has been awarding a significant
amount in loans, indexed in TJLP, to borrowers in sectors or activities that do not show demonstrable
externalities on an ex-ante basis.

90. BNDES operational guidelines should ensure that the scope for subsidized lending is in line with activities
providing significant external effects. In all probability, this is a far narrower set of projects than BNDES
currently finances. This will allow BNDES to delimit the relevant subsidy component, be more selective in its
lending, avoid crowding out commercial banks, and lead to a better pricing of risks.

91. Credit-rationed loan applicants (and those that did not pass the externality test) would enter the second
decision stream.

        The additionality stream identifies strong projects from eligible firms that justify support by BNDES at
         (notional) market rates, reflecting BNDES cost of funds as it issues bonds and taps capital markets. This
         would be a subset of firms shut out of the market for long-term finance due to specific market failures
         that typically – but not only – penalize young, high-impact firms (in terms of sale and employment
         growth), pioneers in emerging sectors, with limited borrowing capacity due to a short track record.
         BNDES would provide access to term finance for such firms (credit and guarantees) at market rates.36
         The filter would exclude older, family-owned, slow-growth, low productivity firms, and those clustering


35
   This is an actual example mentioned in Section II. Coordination is certainly required and the activity most likely merits support
based on positive social impact from investment for the research, development, and manufacture of drugs (and their inputs)
targeting the so-called neglected (tropical) diseases. Yet coordination externalities may not require subsidized finance; to the
contrary, BNDES might actually charge a premium for creating the conditions – or the ecosystem – for firms to productively transact
with each other and connect themselves to demand.
36
   As discussed in Section IV, BNDES would do well to tap both capital markets and private banks in the process of attracting private
capital, syndicating with the use of the so-called B-loan structures.
                                                                 34
       in mature sectors. Most of these firms would have access to at least moderately competitive market
       alternatives, so BNDES intervention would not be necessary.

92. The question is how to define eligibility in the additionality stream. Which firms should access BNDES
finance and under what terms? How do they compare with the firms currently being supported? Are those firms
indeed credit constrained? And for what underlying reason? What is the nature of the market failure – if any –
they face?

93. In Section II, this paper initially suggests the additionality test as the filter. It ultimately attempts to answer
a counterfactual: In the absence of BNDES, how would the firm finance the project? What alternatives are
available? It stands to reason that most large firms have at least moderately competitive alternatives, so BNDES
intervention would not be necessary. Thus the focus here on size as a criterion, based on the highly simplified
premise that the vast majority (if not all) SMEs are indeed credit constrained.

94. Going forward, this selection strategy might continue to be employed because it also saves on
administrative costs and allows for a decentralized operation using second-tier institutions. However, the
additionality test might be insufficient to identify firms that are credit constrained from a significant market
failure – economy-wide uncertainties (from macro instability and regulatory failures) coupled with information
asymmetries, that shut them out of the market despite their positive role of entering and interjecting dynamism
into markets, bringing productivity gains to the economy, promoting growth, and creating jobs. With this in
mind, further steps might be needed to establish eligibility for BNDES support as the bank transitions to new
ways to foster the development of the Brazilian economy. The emphasis would be on a subclass of firms –
generally SMEs – that more often than not are hampered by such market failures. From this perspective, firms
could be ranked or classified by:

1. Age, with young firms (say, less than 5 years old) having less of an observable track record and, therefore,
being more credit constrained than mature firms.

2. Nature, with entrepreneurial firms facing greater credit restrictions – due to a greater dependence on a single
individual, or a small number of individuals – compared to more established firms and those in the public
market.

3. Growth trajectory, both in terms of sales and productivity, with high-growth firms likely to face stronger
information asymmetries because of the shifting nature of their market positions and riskier bets than firms with
a steadier path (although some high-growth firms are attractive to VC funds and other capital-market
instruments).

4. Activity, with pioneering firms in emerging sectors facing greater financing restrictions than their more
mature followers.

95. In all four instances, eligible firms – younger, entrepreneurial, high growth, and pioneering in emerging
sectors – arguably face significant credit constraints. Private markets tend to be less responsive, and BNDES
would be justified in providing credit and guarantees, among other instruments. It should be noted that these
characteristics tend to be highly correlated with size; with eligible firms tending to be SMEs (although the
reverse is not true – all SMEs are not eligible according to the criteria).

96. Figure 3.1 depicts a relatively simplified but essentially correct way to visualize the decision process or
algorithm that would be embedded in BNDES operational policies. To save on transaction costs, the
additionality test in the short to medium term would resort to a simple size criterion. Over time, however,
BNDES may shift its emphasis to increasingly support credit constrained, high-impact, pioneering,
entrepreneurial firms which would be mostly – but not only - SMEs.

Additional streams for alternative objectives

97. In addition BNDES supporting firms on externality and additionality/impact grounds, should specific
industries be the object of intervention? Are there economic circumstances that might justify some form of
targeted action by BNDES? Or should sector-specific programs (and funds) be discontinued?

98. As previously discussed, an industry to be the targeted would need to command a significant, classical
positive externality. It might be related, for example, to better stewardship of the environment, improvements in
public health, the dissemination of cost-effective gains in education, and improved access to cultural goods. Or
an intervention might be justified if the industry fails to emerge or develop due to coordination problems. This
might be the case of a gap between supply and demand, or a chicken-and-egg situation between input providers
and output producers, ending in a low-level activity equilibrium that might be broken by an “honest broker.?

99. Those are, of course, very different types of externalities, and each would call for different types of BNDES
interventions. Classical positive externalities might justify subsidies on the presumption that firms should be
incentivized to produce at the socially optimum level. Firms in these industries would be potentially eligible by
passing the externality test, and there would be no need for an industry eligibility window.

       The latter would only be open for emerging and potentially competitive industries that present
       significant and verifiable coordination externalities (with or without infant-industry aspects).
       Internalizing them might require BNDES’ programmatic action to overcome what might still be
       determined a market failure. It could well involve a proactive role for BNDES in designing public-
       private compacts to address coordination externalities, perhaps augmented by technical assistance and
       consultancy services, either directly or with the support of other institutions. It remains to be established
       that BNDES has a clear comparative advantage in this regard.


                                                        37
100. BNDES intervention that pushes an emerging industry to attain a competitive standing would not
necessarily involve subsidies.37 Importantly, for an intervention of this nature to be well-grounded, such
industries would need to be potentially competitive once relieved of a potential lack of coordination among
agents. In particular, prior to any support, it would need to be established:

         The presence of certain fundamental endowments that constitute the underlying comparative advantage
          for this industry (knowledge, human resources, raw materials).

         Demand for the targeted industry can be tapped.

         Entrepreneurs, firms, and groups are able to credibly supply goods and services on a competitive basis
          with the BNDES intervention – and within a specific time horizon.

101. In sum, these hurdles suggest there might be relatively few cases for industry-specific support, which
would need to be justified on clear grounds: (i) classical positive externalities; (ii) infant/emerging industries; or
(iii) coordination externalities that would hamper the industry’s existence. These are necessary but not sufficient
conditions. For a program targeting a new industry, the remaining conditions for BNDES to consider might
include basic endowments, a demand that can be effectively captured, and agents willing to commit their own
resources.

IV.       BNDES in Transition


102. BNDES is changing its approach – simplifying processes, increasing its focus on SMEs and on
infrastructure projects in sectors commanding the largest externalities, supporting innovative firms, and
promoting better capital-market practices. At the same time, BNDES must deal with a legacy of investments
and lending operations that in retrospect might not have been the best use of public money. Their performance
has been made worse by the current recession.

103. In 2015, only 15% of BNDES loans (in value terms) went to firms that were credit constrained, and in
sectors or engaged in activities with significant externalities (Table 4.1). Conversely, firms that on a prima facie
basis were neither credit-rationed nor engaged in activities producing significant externalities received about
31.5% of the loans. Finally, SMEs in other sectors comprised 24.8% of the total, while large and medium-large
firms in the externality stream added to 28.6%. BNDES could have redirected nearly a third of the loans to
other borrowers, ensuring greater additionality and addressing the key market failures discussed in Sections II
and III.

   In the presence of coordination externalities, the focus of BNDES program should be to bridge this market gap, providing (and
eventually charging for) coordination services.

  (ii) all automatic contracts are for SMEs; (iii) all non-automatic contracts refer to large and medium-Large companies; (iv) ABC (low-carbon agriculture) and
  INOVAGRO programs are included as low-carbon agriculture, with loans from indexed to TJLP and directed to SMEs; (v) loans for innovation are of the same order of
  magnitude as 2015 disbursements for such activities (R$5.5 billion), and they are indexed by TJLP and segmented between SMEs and large and medium-large firms
  according to BNDES 2015’s disbursements mix. Note that the project description of no n-automatic contract loans allowed adding two additional categories to the
  externality stream: Urban Mobility (Metro, LRT) and Renewable Energy (solar, wind power, and biomass) projects.


  104. Projects that fail to satisfy both the externality and additionality tests are supported at subsidized rates
  (Table 4.2). If the simple operational rule described above were used, loans for projects undertaken by credit-
  rationed firms commanding no externalities would not be indexed by TJLP, nor would projects that do not fit
  either stream.

105. Out of R$38.7 billion of TJLP-indexed loans signed in 2015 (representing 50.4% of total loans), over a
quarter (26.3%) were allocated to operations outside the externality and additionality streams (Table 4.3). This
is twice as much as operations characterized by both positive additionality and externalities (13.8%). Most loans
paying TJLP went to credit-unconstrained firms operating in sectors characterized with significant external
economies (52.3%), with the remainder (7.5%) going to SMEs not engaged in externality-generating activities.

106. In sum: BNDES is lending to firms that do not seem credit constrained on a prima facie basis, and it is
subsidizing activities without a clear economic rationale.

107. In coming years, BNDES is likely to have two fundamental roles:

•      Financing projects that effectively command large externalities. It is possible that the imperative of
sustainable development will take a “front seat? in BNDES priorities, most likely in renewable energy; water,
sewage, and solid waste disposal and recycling; urban mobility; and new low-carbon activities and
technologies.

108. From an operational perspective, BNDES should continuously reassess its policies to ensure that only
sectors or activities that clearly command significant externalities will be granted credit subsidies, subject to
passing the externality test. In principle, there should be no material reason to postpone implementation of this
policy.

•      Offering long-term credit and guarantees to bona fide firms excluded from the market due to
informational asymmetries and other relevant credit-market failures (as systemic uncertainty), including the
need to help solvent and viable firms to restructure. . Economic reforms and the return to macroeconomic
normalcy will gradually deepen credit markets, and credit constraints will become less relevant over time.


                                                                40
109. Nonetheless, this paper recognizes that targeting a certain class of firms has costs, so it may be more
efficient for an initial period to assume that all SMEs are credit-rationed. This would be due to macroeconomic
uncertainty and risk, regulatory barriers in the allocation of credit, and credit-market failures – all of which can
differentially affect SMEs. BNDES would then have a legitimate role to step in and fill this gap at least while
parallel reforms in the system of credit allocation take place and macroeconomic uncertainty is reduced. Over
the longer term, as reforms take hold and markets develop, including capital markets, BNDES will veer toward
financing high-impact, entrepreneurial firms, and pioneers in new markets.

110. It is important to stress the importance of establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework that will
help refine the processes that make projects eligible for BNDES finance. In an important development, the new
operational policy announced on January 5, 2017, was accompanied by BNDES management’s decision to
establish a Monitoring and Evaluation Department, an important signal to markets and civil society that the
concept of analyzing projects from a cost-benefit perspective and the practice of impact evaluation will
increasingly become the BNDES norm. In fact, this mindset should be extended to all public-sector
expenditures, transfers, and subsidies, including those associated with directed credit.

111. Finally, as already noted in Section I, BNDES uses extensively a network of second-tier agents to pass on
resources and provide subsidized TJLP-based lending. Insofar as the credit risk is with the agent, they charge a
“what the market will bear? risk premium. BNDES should assess the possibility of exhausting such rents by
auctioning off its funds to qualified agents, adding a premium according to the intermediary’s risk profile.

Changing the balance of instruments

112. With capacities on par with other significant development banks, BNDES has most of the instruments
required to carry out its mandate. The key difference would be in the limited use of financial instruments other
than regular lending operations – outside of capital market operations and investments in externally managed
funds by BNDESPAR (see Annex 6). In particular, guarantees are sparingly employed in direct operations,
while warranties – though available – have been dormant for over a decade (in fact, since 2002). For indirect
operations, BNDES has a guarantee fund (FGI) geared toward supporting SMEs that borrow BNDES funds
from second-tier institutions.38 In this sense, BNDES is not “leveraging? its funds; it is enhancing access for
firms deprived of, or unwilling to offer, solid or real guarantees.

113. The basic reason for such a strong preference for regular lending operations relate ultimately to their cost
and the wedge between market rates and TJLP. In addition, BNDES receives transfers from FAT on a quasi-
automatic basis, creating a strong inertia that pushes BNDES into a “conservative? course on its asset structure.




38
  In indirect operations, BNDES FGI functions as a support for SME borrowers, complementing normal guarantees and facilitating
access to finance with longer maturities, lower entry requirements, and lower interest rates (see Annex 7). FGI guarantees 20% to
80% of the total credit provided, with its cost – the Guarantee Grant Fee (ECG) – depending on the amount financed, the percentage
guaranteed by the fund, and the maturity of the contract. In 2015, BNDES FGI conducted 2,711 operations, guaranteeing R$350.9
million out of R$465.3 million in credit, or 1.52% of the value of operations signed with SMEs in that year (R$30,631 million). Thus,
even BNDES FGI appears to have a very limited role in the enhancement of credit for SMEs.
                                                                 41
114. However, this will likely change in coming years as BNDES shifts policies to ensure that subsidized credit
is used with a solid externality-related rationale, and TJLP progressively converges to market rates39. At the
same time, resorting to market finance for BNDES’ operational needs and creating a BNDES-specific notional
market rate will help crowd-in the private sector. Under these conditions, the use of guarantees, warranties, and
similar instruments will become more attractive from the borrowers’ perspective. As market rates become
dominant, third-party funding will become more prevalent, and products such as guarantees – if correctly priced
– will become a normal complement to credit. When the choice instrument is not (only) regular loans,
leveraging third-party funds would strongly enhance BNDES ability to support investment.40 The provision of
market-driven solutions to firms’ financing needs implies a goal of reducing direct lending in favor of
guarantees and second-tier operations. From this perspective, BNDES’ should aim at addressing market failures
by developing financial solutions that crowd-in private sector players41.

115. The outstanding missing element in BNDES’ portfolio of services is technical assistance and consultancy,
the kind offered, for example, by Chile’s CORFO and CDB. BNDES has a significant staff, most well-trained
and sufficiently competent to provide solid consultancy and assistance. These assets could be instrumental in
combining finance and technical assistance to subnational governments, which generally have a deficit of
competence at the technical level to address the challenges of designing and effectively deploying new projects.
For SMEs, it might be more efficient for BNDES to reach out to other government institutions that provide such
services, such as SEBRAE and APEX.

Adjusting the funding of BNDES

116. Will there be enough resources for BNDES to fulfill its role in the coming years? Clearly, the recession
has adversely impacted the demand for financing (except for refinancing existing loans and providing working
capital, to which BNDES is responding effectively). Over the medium and longer term, with the resumption of
growth and investment, BNDES will be in a position to respond to the extent that it can tap market resources
while changing its liability structure to accommodate greater use of guarantees and related products which
would need to be funded with equity or grants. At the same time, below-market rate lending will be
progressively scarcer, a reflection of a stricter fiscal regime that will impose additional requirements to ensure
that credit and other subsidies are rationed effectively.

117. More generally, BNDES will need to shift away from excessive dependence on FAT constitutional
transfers. Instead, in addition to strengthening its capital base, it should issue debt of different maturities –
BNDES bonds – to build a yield curve. In so doing, BNDES will be able to establish what its notional market
rate is. This is the financial cost it would be charging for most of its loans, with TJLP being used

39
   To the extent that is the case, BNDEs credit lines at market rates would only be useful for smaller financial intermediaries, typically
non-bank institutions. Note that as BNDEs migrates from granting credit lines to commercial banks to granting credit lines to small
financial intermediaries (as larger part of its funds are granted at market rates) then credit risk assessment of financial
intermediaries may need to be strengthened and credit risk premium pricing sharpened. Still, when providing subsidized funding
lines (on the basis of externality arguments), it is important to ensure those resources are auctioned off so banks` monopolistic rents
are extracted.
40
   A number of development banks make regular use of guarantees, such as CORFO and Germany´s KFW, the former with a focus on
SMEs, the latter focusing on start-ups (firms with less than five years of existence).
41
   In other emerging markets, provision of credit lines is useful to support small and specialized SME financial intermediaries (e.g.
leasing, factoring and asset base lending intermediaries) that help complement markets and introduce competition.
                                                                   42
parsimoniously. This process will gain traction with macroeconomic normalization, lower nominal and real
policy rates, and the shift in BNDES operational policies to charging market rates as a rule. The goal will be to
offer what is truly scarce: in addition to guarantees, long-term credit for credit-rationed firms.

118. Tapping resources in domestic and international capital markets has multiple advantages. First, it shifts
pressure away from fiscal and quasi-fiscal sources. For now, Treasury transfers are eliminated, but nothing
guarantees that the same deleterious and distortionary practice will not someday return under a populist
government. Second, and conversely, the quasi-automatic nature of FAT transfers gives BNDES the incentive
to use TJLP beyond what might be economically grounded, creating a vicious cycle. Third, capital markets
provide BNDES access to a very large pool of resources; issuing bonds of different maturities allows it to build
a yield curve, providing a BNDES-specific (and realistic) notional market rate that BNDES can use to correctly
price its loans. In fact, SELIC is not the market rate, but a poor substitute, especially when BNDES has the
means, ability, and reputation to calculate its true opportunity cost. It is against this opportunity cost that all
current and future operations should be measured in establishing the cost to BNDES, and to the country, of
BNDES’ operations. Finally, and possibly most important, an adequate pricing of BNDES loans and a far less
elastic supply of subsidized resources will serve as a powerful tool – and incentive – to reassess BNDES
products and programs, their costs and benefits, and the extent to which such a complex structure is needed to
attain BNDES ends. A more focused bank, in turn, will likely allow for a lower spread and a more competitive
cost to the borrower, consistent with overall market conditions.

Transitioning BNDES’ role in infrastructure finance

119. In recent years, BNDES assumed a dominant role in supporting infrastructure investment. In 2014, more
than one-third of total resources committed to the sector originated from BNDES (Table 4.4).

120. Excluding budgetary support for infrastructure investment and equity contributions from public and
private firms, BNDES’ role was absolutely dominant, being responsible for 67.3% of the resources allocated by
banks and capital markets (Table 4.5). The immediate question is: Which institutional arrangement could
substitute – at least in part – for BNDES in coming years as the demand for infrastructure funds increases with
the imperative of modernizing the country´s infrastructure?

121. Even as private investment takes up a greater role, it is unlikely that non-government sources of finance
will assume a dominant position in the foreseeable future. Commercial banks will continue to find it difficult to
rival the public sector’s highly competitive funding (constitutional FAT transfers to BNDES, FGTS), while
pensions, insurance companies, and investors that might be interested in the sector have the option of a safe,
liquid, and high-return alternative in buying Treasuries.42 At the same time, it is equally unlikely that the
BNDES and CEF balance sheets will be able to grow in line with the long-term financing needs for
infrastructure. After all, there is an overriding imperative of financing in the upcoming years nominal deficits
close to 9% of GDP and primary deficits of over 2% of GDP.

122. What should BNDES’ role be in this context? There is no immutable scenario. Progressively, a new fiscal
regime will be put in place, resulting in an increase of public savings and a fall in both policy and market
interest rates. This will put less pressure on institutional and family resources, which will be redirected toward
other investments. At the same time, BNDES should support the development of private debt-securities market




42
     This would also apply to commercial banks, particularly for longer tenors.
                                                                    44
by, first, ensuring that companies looking for its support access capital markets issuing private paper.43 BNDES
could provide credit enhancements on loan securitizations or undertake a supportive role as medium-sized firms
issue corporate bonds. Second, BNDES should assume a leading role in syndicating loans – as IFC has done
historically – and attracting pension funds, crowding-in these important sources of finance on the premise that
BNDES will transition toward market-based operations in most cases.44 In both instances, there is a need to
define of more robust systems of guarantees in the construction phase of infrastructure projects. Third, BNDES
is in a differentiated position to encourage project finance structures in which risk is effectively shared between
the sponsor, creditors, and insurance companies, especially in its critical phase.45

123. Finally, BNDES has been called upon to support the PPI – The Infrastructure Investments Program, made
into law (13,334/2016). The program offers a number of positive substantive and procedural points, and calls
for continuing BNDES involvement in financing the sector. The earlier discussions in this paper established that
the use of subsidized finance should be parsimonious and strictly related to the presence of significant sectoral
externalities. The point certainly bears repeating. Take one example: Brazil privatized four airports on a stand-
alone basis in 2017: Porto Alegre, Florianopolis, Salvador, and Fortaleza.46 It is unclear why privatizing airports
should involve subsidies to the groups acquiring the right to operate and modernize them. Airports are
structured not only as logistics operations for passengers and cargo, but as real estate investments (parking,
hotels, office parks) and one or more self-contained shopping centers. Clearly, when well-managed, they are
profitable operations. Moreover, airports serve a segment of the population that cannot be equated with the poor
or the very poor, even if air travel has become more inclusive in the past decade or so. Finally, even with a
“social tariff? for low-income air travelers, this would not imply that credit subsidies should be granted to future
operators. This same reasoning applies to most infrastructure assets and operations – with very few exceptions,
such as urban mobility, water/wastewater disposal and treatment/solid waste disposal and utilization, and
renewable energy. And even in these instances, the externality test discussed in Sections II and III of this paper
should be applied to make sure there is clear additionality in using TJLP or similar financing. Arguably, this
transition should not take long. In fact, BNDES has already successfully changed the operational rules in the
case of electricity transmission, deciding correctly not to offer subsidized credit in two significant and highly
successful concession auctions in late 2016 and 2017. Now is the time to extend the new approach to other
infrastructure assets and related transactions.




43
   The government would do well to contemplate norms that stimulate the issuance of standardized and low-value securities that
are easily analyzed by investors; help in organizing a secondary market for debentures; and improve the legal security for the paper-
taker, with the change in risk allocation between shareholder and creditor.
44
   To reverse the limited participation of private banks in the financing of infrastructure projects, it is necessary to structure a broad
and liquid secondary market for banks’ long-term funding instruments; to update legislation to give priority to the preservation of
the company/asset as a way to reinforce the legal security of long operations; and rebalance the rights and obligations of
shareholders and creditors, still strongly biased towards the former.
45
    In this regard, reforms are needed in the insurance market to attract insurance companies willing to provide effective
performance bonds (in contrast to what has been the rule up to now in many projects), thereby taking an active role in structuring
non-recourse financing and being awarded step-in and other related rights to assure the continuity of the project if sponsors and
equity holders fail to fulfill their obligations.
46
   The operator will not be obliged to absorb regional airports currently operated by Infraero, the government owned airport
operator, some of which might not be able to cover current costs – although even that is not obvious under a new management.
                                                                   45
BNDES Governance

124. Many of the legacy problems facing BNDES might have been averted if an effective governance structure
had been present. In fact, BNDES has historically functioned more as an instrument of government, although its
permanent staff has at times blocked certain initiatives that were regarded as deleterious to BNDES. Still,
several factors have opened the door to significant interference by governments in BNDES policies and
operations. These include the loss of institutional memory with the retirement of a still relatively young and
productive staff, the hiring of a large contingent of new professionals, and a board restricted by statute to only
providing guidance (orientação superior). It is not known, for instance, the board questioning the large
Treasury transfers to BNDES, or the quality of many of its operations supporting “national champions? (as in
the case of JBS and the meatpacking industry), or still contractors domestically or abroad, despite the significant
cost-related and other discrepancies of such projects with respect to market references, a distortion now being
corrected by new management.

125. BNDES governance can be improved by enhancing the effectiveness of its board. The fact that statutorily,
the board only provides guidance has allowed significant government interference in BNDES policies and
operations. The federal government holds 100% of the shares and appoints all 12 Board members (employees
have an elected representative also appointed by the President of the Republic). International good practices
suggest effective board diversity, with the presence of highly qualified and vocal independent members. This
could be accomplished with a change of the BNDES statute along the lines of the efforts to improve governance
at Petrobrás and Eletrobrás.

126. The presence of minority shareholders may further improve BNDES governance. The government may
want to dilute its position by inviting other first-rate development banks (multilateral or even bilateral) to
capitalize BNDES – up to, say, a 25% share of the capital. By itself, this strategic change would rebalance the
board with the presence of representatives of shareholders. They would be complemented with independent
members, both domestic and international, with a commitment to modernize BNDES by following best
corporate practices in terms of governance, management, and operations. This move would provide BNDES
with the guarantee that management will have a mandate to pursue long-term development goals, with a focus
on the more severe credit and capital market failures that hamper the Brazilian economy.

V. Conclusions
127. Brazil has a complex system of directed credit, which has gained even more relevance as directed credit’s
share of total banking credit increased from 35.6% in 2007 to 50.1% in 2016. Among the main agents, three
federal banks stand out: Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econômica Federal and BNDES.
128. BNDES has 60-plus years of supporting infrastructure and promoting industry. Its mandate was vastly
expanded in 2009 with the government’s decision that public banks – and BNDES in particular – should play a
decisive countercyclical role. With its expanded mandate, BNDES received massive transfers of resources from
the Treasury, which continued until 2014 even though the Brazilian economy has rebounded and in fact grew by
7.53% in 2010.



                                                        46
129. In many ways, such transfers distorted BNDES policies and practices, overextending its reach with new
externally driven programs and expanding its balance sheet at an unsustainable rate, leading to many possibly
unjustified transactions. The ethos of the period was to push credit out; approve operations without additionality
(that is, to borrowers with viable funding alternatives); and use subsidized credit for borrowers engaged in
largely unwarranted activities – namely, projects commanding no significant externalities.

130. This period is over. New management is in the process of redirecting BNDES, dealing with the legacy of
the past decade and redefining its operational policies. This paper is an attempt to guide BNDES’ future as a
development bank by providing some conceptual underpinnings and implications for its operational policies.

131. The paper argued that BNDES is justified to step in to address fundamentally two types of market failures:

132. First, credit rationing arising out of (i) informational asymmetries that penalize younger, high-impact
firms, entrants in new domestic or export markets, and enterprises engaged in innovation; and, under current
circumstances, (ii) macroeconomic imbalances and regulatory distortions that make it more difficult firms –
particularly (but not only) SMEs – to access guarantees and long-term credit, with a tighter constraint for
infrastructure projects. As previously emphasized, missing or imperfect finance markets do not necessarily
imply an externality and should not be associated with a subsidy.

133. A second rationale is the presence of significant positive externalities, which drive a wedge between social
and private rates of return. As a principle, subsidies should be used with parsimony. Externalities must be
significant, and credit or other BNDES-specific instruments must be effective to compensate for the market
distortion at the lowest cost.

134. An examination of BNDES’ 2015-16 disbursements and 2015 contracts show that most operations were
directed to large and medium-large firms with limited or no additionality, or to firms not engaged in activities or
sectors commanding significant externalities. However, it should be acknowledged that a closer look would be
needed for rule-of-reason cases, including the potential presence of cluster and network economies, and
territorial externalities. The analysis also shows that most subsidized credit could not be rationalized in terms of
external economies.

135. From this perspective, BNDES may consider changes in its operational policies to ensure a more effective
use of resources, including the introduction of the previously discussed additionality and externality tests to
filter applicants. There are also a limited number of industries or sectors with significant coordination
externalities; in this context, BNDES could promote the clustering of activities or ensure that complementary
investments (e.g., infrastructure) occur in the proper sequence and time frame.

136. This paper also stresses the importance of a different funding structure for BNDES, more consistent with
the use of guarantees and related instruments (which requires a shift in its liability structure to more equity), and
one less dependent on the government or constitutionally mandated transfers. As an alternative, BNDES should
tap the resources of domestic and international capital markets. This will allow the bank to price its products
more efficiently and ensure a more sustainable balance sheet. It would be to BNDES advantage to issue papers
of different maturities to build a BNDES-specific yield curve, thereby establishing a notional market rate for its
loans. The use of TJLP should be far more selective on the presumption that the critical failure in Brazilian

                                                         47
credit markets is the lack of long-term finance. By relying more on domestic (and international) capital markets,
BNDES could fill the market void without appealing to the government for funds.

137. Over the medium to longer term, BNDES is likely to become a more focused development bank, engaged
in two core activities: (i) offsetting certain market failures with guarantees and long-term credit, whichever is a
binding constraint and (ii) helping to promote the development of security markets and attract commercial
banks, insurance companies, and investment, pension, and other funds to provide market-driven solutions to the
financing needs of Brazil’s firms and subnational governments. In this regard, BNDES will need to increase the
use of guarantees, warranties, and similar instruments to provide market-based solutions that crowd-in the
private sector.

138. Many of the proposed changes in this paper are already being introduced or considered by current
management. The modernization of BNDES, however, will likely need a step further, moving forward with an
improved governance structure featuring a differently composed board of directors, with independent members
and the ability to support management in its decisions that target the long-term sustainability of BNDES.

139. Finally, this paper suggests the government should seriously consider a capital increase by inviting
multilateral development institutions to become new shareholders, diluting the union from its current 100% to,
say, 75%. The goals would be consolidating the notion and practice of a new governance structure while
contributing new ideas, technologies, and practices for a more effective BNDES as a 21st century development
bank.

       3. Loan structure and disbursement patterns: BNDES provides loans either directly or indirectly (on-
       lending operations). It usually provides direct financing to large projects; it provides indirect financing
       through a network of accredited financial intermediaries, including the largest banks in Brazil. Most
       commercial banks in Brazil operate and on-lend BNDES credit lines. BNDES assumes the financial
       intermediary’s credit risk, but BNDES has direct recourse to the assets of the final borrower in the case of
       insolvency of a financial intermediary.

     Disbursements, net income, ROAA, and ROAE are on a six-month basis.
                                                                49

4.      Credit risk policies. BNDES states that it has rigorous and transparent risk procedures that assure loan-
portfolio quality, even under stress scenarios. The non-performing loan rate is low at 1.38% of loan portfolio
                                                       51
Loans require repayment capacity and collateral. The bank offers full allowance coverage of past-due loans with
low liquidity risk; maturity of liabilities is substantially longer than that of the assets. It also has low market
risk, matching assets and liabilities through on-lending and short-term investments. As for derivatives, they are
used for hedge purposes only.




5.      BNDES equity portfolio. The market value of BNDES portfolio is US$ 18.3 billion, with direct stakes
in 47 funds and more than 150 firms. The bank acts as a long-term and minority investor, seeking to strengthen




corporate governance while supporting innovative firms.

Annex 4 – BNDES Main Funds under
Operation/Management
To support its activities, BNDES requires adequate resources. The particularities of
Brazil’s domestic credit supply, concentrated in the short term, led the government to
seek alternative solutions to raise funds to support long-term investment projects in the
form of fund institutions.

This annex presents information on the main funds under BNDES’ purview. In some
cases, an effective inflow of financial resources supports investment projects; in other
situations, the funds promote the complementation of guarantees.

GUARANTEE FUNDS

BNDES FGI - Investment Guarantee Fund

The Investment Guarantee Fund (FGI), established on June 30, 2009, through a decision
of the BNDES Board of Directors is a private fund administered by the bank to facilitate
credit acquisition by micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). In addition,
fund benefits individual entrepreneurs and autonomous truckers, supporting them in
their growth and modernization.

FGI operates by guaranteeing BNDES financing for working capital, acquisition of
national machinery and equipment, projects to expand production units, acquisition of
national software, export-oriented production, among others. The federal government,
BNDES, and public and private financial institutions are among the fund’s shareholders.

BNDES Export Guarantee Fund - FGE

The Export Guarantee Fund (FGE) was created by Provisional Measure No.
1,583/1997, and, after consecutive reissues, was converted into Law 9,818/1999. It is an
accounting fund, linked to the Ministry of Finance, and aims to cover guarantees
provided by the federal government in export credit insurance (SCE) operations. The
purpose of the SCE is to insure Brazilian exports of goods and services against
commercial, political, and extraordinary risks that may affect the economic and
financial transactions related to export credit operations.

Decree 3,937/1997 and subsequent amendments regulate SCE, insurance firms
operating in the segment, the guarantee given by the Union and the FGE. The Brazilian
Agency for the Management of Guarantors and Guarantees SA (ABGF) was created by
Decree 7.976/2013. It is a public company linked to the Ministry of Finance in the form
of a corporation responsible for, among other things, the execution of all services
related to SCE with FGE ballast. The fund’s initial equity was established through the
transfer of 98 billion registered preferred shares issued by Banco do Brasil SA and 1.2
billion nominative preferred shares issued by Telecomunicações Brasileiras SA
(TELEBR?S).


                                           64
Resources of the FGE are:
      The proceeds from the sale of shares;
      The reversal of unapplied balances;
      Dividends and share capital remuneration;
      The result of the financial investments of the resources;
      Commissions arising from the provision of security; and
      Funds from the Treasury.

BNDES is the manager of the FGE, pursuant to Article 8 of Law 9,818/99, ratified by
Decree No. 4,929/2003.

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS

PIS-PASEP Fund and the Worker Support Fund - FAT

PIS-PASEP is the result of the unification of programs constituted with funds from the
Social Integration Program (PIS) and the Program for the Formation of Public Servants’
Equity (PASEP). Since 1974, the collections related to these programs have been a
source of funds for BNDES.

PIS-PASEP is a social fund linked to the Ministry of Finance, with the following
objectives:
      Integrate employees into the life and development of enterprises;
      Ensure employees and public servants the usufruct of progressive individual
       equity;
      Stimulate savings and correct distortions in the distribution of income; and
      Make possible the parallel use of accumulated resources to favor economic-
       social development.

The Worker Support Fund (FAT) is a special fund of an accounting and financial
nature, linked to the Ministry of Labor and Employment. FAT resources are intended to
cover unemployment insurance and salary bonuses as well as economic development
programs through BNDES, in a minimum of 40% of this collection. Its main source of
funds derives from the contributions of PIS and PASEP.

Until 2009, a significant part of the bank's financing structure was concentrated in two
government funds: PIS-PASEP and FAT. In 1988, the Federal Constitution determined
that 40% of the PIS-PASEP collection should be used to finance economic development
programs through BNDES, not only to protect unemployed workers but also to generate
employment opportunities. In 1990, with the end of the PIS-PASEP Fund and the
creation of FAT, the collection of PIS-PASEP contributions was shifted to the FAT,
which became one of the main sources of BNDES funds.


                                             65
The funds raised through this constitutional determination are called Constitutional FAT
and are remunerated by the TJLP in the case of financing in reals or Libor plus dollar
variation in the case of export financing. There is no provision for repayment of the
principal – except in case of insufficient cash to cover the unemployment insurance and
salary bonus programs. The periodic payment of interest (semiannually) is required. The
balance of the Constitutional FAT is considered subordinated debt and is computed in
the calculation of BNDES Reference Equity. It is a permanent and safe source of
financing, with costs compatible with the long-term financing of investments in
productive activities. Constitutional FAT allows BNDES a free decision on the
application of its resources, provided it involves economic development programs as
determined by the Federal Constitution.

In addition to the constitutional transfers, BNDES funds the FAT with so-called FAT
Special Deposits, which are remunerated by TJLP from the release of the loans to the
final beneficiaries and by the same criteria applied to the Treasury’s cash resources. In
addition to the remuneration, a percentage of amortization is paid monthly. Funds raised
as FAT Special Deposits are applied in specific programs and sectors, previously
determined and approved by the Executive Secretariat of the FAT Deliberative Council.

The balance of FAT resources as of June 30, 2016 was R$ 226.8 billion. From this total,
R$212.9 billion constituted the balance of the Constitutional FAT, with R$13.9 billion
of the balance in FAT Special Deposits.

In the first half of 2016, R$10.9 billion of FAT funds were invested, with R$10.6 billion
related to the Constitutional FAT. The balance of resources of the PIS-PASEP Fund as
of June 30, 2016 was R$34.0 billion. PIS-PASEP funding has not been realized since
the fund's extinction in 1990.

Merchant Marine Fund (FMM)

The Merchant Marine Fund is designed to provide resources for the development of the
Merchant Navy and the Brazilian shipbuilding and repair industry. The Ministry of
Transports administers the FMM through the Directorate of the Merchant Marine Fund
(CDFMM). FMM’s main source of funds is the Merchant Marine Renewal Freight
(AFRMM), a tribute established in 1987. Its legal nature is that of contribution of
intervention in the economic domain (CIDE), and its objective is to support the
Brazilian naval sector.

As stipulated by Decree No. 5,543/2005, BNDES, as the FMM’s financial agent, has
the following responsibilities:
      Analyze the technical and economic feasibility studies aimed at obtaining FMM
       support;
      Negotiate the conditions for contracting financial support operations in
       compliance with the requirements stipulated by the National Monetary Council;
      Approve and contract the financial support operations of the FMM, respecting
       the internal rules of the financial agent applicable to the subject;

                                           66
      Credit the FMM, on the due dates, the amounts corresponding to payments
       related to the return of financing (excluding the remuneration of the financial
       agent) and to pay the disbursements required by contractual events; and
      Monitor and supervise projects benefiting from FMM resources and financed by
       the financial agent. Activities include financing Brazilian shipyards for projects
       of implantation, expansion, and modernization and for construction and repair of
       ships and to national navigation companies for ordering vessels and equipment,
       repairs, and jumborization next to Brazilian shipbuilders and the Navy.

On June 30, 2016, the FMM’s total resources in BNDES were R$19.1 billion. In the
first half of 2016, resources of R$818 million were added (R$3.3 billion in 2015).

FI-FGTS

The FI-FGTS is a private fund created in 2007, governed by its own regulations and
acting in accordance with determinations established by its deliberative collegiate
bodies – FGTS Curatorial Council and FI-FGTS Investment Committee. The fund’s
purpose is to use its resources for construction, renovation, expansion, or
implementation of infrastructure projects in highways, ports, waterways, railways,
energy, sanitation facilities, and airports.

The convergence of interests between FI-FGTS and BNDES results from adherence
between the bank's role as an important financier of the country's infrastructure projects
and the fund's objectives. Through Resolution 577 on October 30, 2008, the FGTS
Board of Trustees amended IF-FGTS regulations to include the possibility of the fund
acquiring, on an exceptional basis, simple debentures from BNDES or its subsidiaries,
issued specifically for its acquisition, up to a limit of R$7 billion. At the end of
December 2008, the R$7 billion funding operation was completed.

On May 2015, a new adjustment was approved in the FI-FGTS regulations, which
included the possibility of the fund acquiring, on an exceptional basis, simple
debentures from BNDES or its subsidiaries, issued specifically for its acquisition, up to
the limit of R$10 billion.

The FI-FGTS does not represent a regular source of resources for BNDES. In December
2008, R$7 billion was invested in infrastructure projects that fell within the fund’s
mandate. There was no funding from FI-FGTS in the first half of 2016. On June 30,
2016, the balance of FI-FGTS resources was R$3.9 billion.

Fund for the Technological Development of Telecommunications – FUNTTEL

An accounting nature characterizes the Fund for the Technological Development of
Telecommunications (FUNTTEL). Objectives include: (i) stimulating technological
innovation, (ii) encouraging the training of human resources, (iii) fostering job creation,
and (iv) increasing the competitiveness of Brazil’s telecommunications industry by
promoting the access of small and medium-sized enterprises to capital resources.

FUNTTEL’s main sources of funding include:
                                            67
      Appropriations included in the annual Budget Law and its additional credits;
      Contribution of half of the gross revenues of companies providing
       telecommunications services in public and private systems;
      Contribution of 1 percent due by the institutions authorized under the Law, on
       the gross collection of participatory events carried out through telephone calls;
       and
      The product of the remuneration of resources passed on to the agents.

FUNTTEL’s s financial agents – BNDES, FINEP, and the CPqD Foundation’s Center
for Research and Development in telecommunications – must apply these resources
exclusively in the telecommunications sector’s programs, projects, and activities.
Beneficiaries of this fund include:
      Non-profit educational institutions, public or private, in Brazil;
      Non-profit national research institutions, public or private;
      Brazilian firms providing telecommunications services; and
      Brazilian firms supplying goods and services for the sector – as long as they are
       engaged in effective production in the country.

Operations using FUNTTEL funds must comply with the following conditions:
      Grace period: up to 30 months from the date of legal formalization of the
       operation;
      Amortization: up to 72 months, counted after grace period;
      Participation: up to 80 percent of the project value to be financed;
      Charges: fixed in TR, plus risk commission from 1% to 4% per annum.

The obligations of the financial agents before FUNTTEL can be highlighted as main:

Regarding administration, FUNTTEL is subordinated to a Management Council made
up of a representative of each of the following organizations or entities, designated by
the Minister of Communications:
      Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC);
      Ministry of Industry, Foreign Trade and Services (MDIC);
      National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL);
      National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES);
      Funding of Studies and Projects (FINEP).




                                            68
National Climate Change Fund - FNMC
The National Fund on Climate Change (FNMC) is an accounting fund, linked to the
Ministry of Environment (MMA), and it aims to secure resources to support projects or
studies aimed at mitigating climate change and adapting to climate change and its
effects.
Funding sources include: appropriations in the annual Budget Law of the Union and in
its additional credits; donations from national and international entities, public or
private; resources derived from interest and amortizations of financing as well as other
modalities determined in Law 12,114/2009.
The FNMC provides resources in two modalities: reimbursable, controlled by BNDES,
and non-reimbursable (grants), handled through MMA.
Amazon Fund (FA)
The Amazon Fund aims to raise donations for non-reimbursable investments for actions
to prevent, monitor, and combat deforestation and to promote the conservation and
sustainable use of the Legal Amazon. The Amazon Fund supports projects in the
following areas:
      Management of public forests and protected areas;
      Control, monitoring, and environmental inspection;
      Sustainable forest management;
      Economic activities developed from the sustainable use of vegetation;
      Ecological and economic zoning, territorial planning, and land regularization;
      Conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; and
      Recovery of deforested areas.
The Amazon Fund can devote up to 20% of its resources to support the development of
systems for monitoring and controlling deforestation in other Brazilian biomes and in
other tropical countries. In addition to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,
thematic areas proposed for Amazon Fund support can be coordinated to contribute to
the achievement of significant results in the implementation of its objectives of
preventing, monitoring, and combating deforestation and promoting conservation and
sustainable use of forests in the Amazon biome.
The Amazon Fund is managed by BNDES, which is also responsible for raising funds,
contracting, and monitoring projects and actions supported. The Amazon Fund has a
Steering Committee (COFA), charged with determining its guidelines and monitoring
the results obtained, and a Technical Committee (CTFA), appointed by the MMA to
certify emissions from deforestation in the Amazon.
On June 30, 2016, total resources of the Amazon Fund were R$2.5 billion for the
financing of projects to prevent, monitor, and combat deforestation and promote the


                                          69
conservation and sustainable use of Amazon Biome forests. In the first half of 2016,
R$88.8 million were added (R$504.8 million in 2015).
Sectorial Audiovisual Fund - FSA
The Sectorial Audiovisual Fund (FSA) is a specific programming category of the
National Fund of Culture (FNC), linked to the Ministry of Culture. Its objective is the
articulated development of the entire productive chain of audiovisual activity in Brazil.
The main objectives are: increased cooperation between various economic agents;
expansion and diversification of the infrastructure of services and exhibition rooms;
strengthening research and innovation in audiovisual subjects; sustained growth of the
market share of national content; and development of new means of diffusion of
Brazilian audiovisual production.
Six budgetary actions were created for the fund’s implementation, four geared toward
development and two focused on administration of applied resources. The four
development actions are:
      Support for specific audiovisual projects;
      Equalization of financial charges on financing operations;
      Investments in firms and projects; and
      Financing to the audiovisual sector.
The FSA's resources come from contributions collected by market players, mainly from
the Contribution for the Development of the National Cinematographic Industry
(CONDECINE) and from the Telecommunications Inspection Fund (FISTEL).
The FSA operates through a Management Committee, whose duties are to define the
guidelines and annual investment plan, monitor the implementation of the actions, and
evaluate the results achieved annually. The fund also has the National Cinema Agency
(Ancine) as Executive Secretariat; as financial agent, BNDES and other financial
institutions accredited by the Management Committee play a major role.

Annex 6 – BNDESPAR and Capital Markets Resources
Through its wholly owned subsidiary BNDES Participações S.A. (BNDESPAR),
BNDES supports Brazilian firms through variable-income instruments (in addition to
the bank’s financing products). BNDESPAR support is present at all stages of firms’
growth. It supports start-ups, early-stage firms and so on, with a strong innovative bias
through investment funds run by market managers chosen through a rigorous selection
process.
Firms in more advanced stages of maturity can be aided through private-equity funds or
the subscription of securities (direct participation), such as convertible shares or
debentures. BNDES also encourages initial public offerings (IPOs) on the main
Brazilian stock market, Bovespa Mais (or another access market with similar
characteristics). Firms that already have their capital stock can receive support through
structured private operations or through the participation of BNDESPAR in public
offerings. The following figures illustrate the performance of BNDESPAR in all stages
of a firm’s growth.

BNDESPAR AS AN INVESTOR IN PRIVATE EQUITY




   Mission: to aid in the capitalization and development of Brazilian firms and contribute to
    the strengthening and modernization of the securities market.

   BNDESPAR invests in national companies directly through minority and temporary stakes
    in the form of stocks or convertible bonds and indirectly through investments in third-party
    managed funds.

   Joint strategic goals and guidelines are drafted between BNDESPAR and BNDES in an
    effort to develop local enterprises and stimulate innovation.

SUPPORT MODALITIES

Direct investments

Through the subscription of shares, BNDESPAR invests in Brazilian firms, becoming a
minority share partner. BNDES’ resources are intended for business plans that fit with
the strategic guidelines and priorities of the BNDES system and involve processes of:
      Modernization and expansion of installed capacity;
      Innovation;
      Consolidation and/or internationalization of Brazilian firms;
      Strengthening productive chains and setting up business complexes; and/or
      Restructuring.
Direct investment in equity participation may occur in the scope of a public offering or
private issuance. The latter case may involve the assignment of preemptive rights by
shareholders of the firms to allow BNDES to enter the firms’ capital. In addition to the
subscription of shares, another variable income instrument used by BNDESPAR to
support Brazilian firms is the convertible debenture, a debt securities that guarantees the
holder an option to convert the debtor balance into shares of the issuer at a pre-defined
rate. BNDESPAR investments are always preceded by analysis of several key factors –
among them, an economic and financial evaluation of the firm and its projects, the
firm’s market performance, its governance and management, and risks and their
mitigating factors.
After its initial investment, BNDES monitors the investees and seeks to guide the
adoption of best practices in management, governance, and sustainability as well as the
strengthening of innovative capacity. In some firms, for example, the bank has the right
to appoint members to the boards of directors and/or fiscal councils, ensured by
agreements with the main shareholders that govern their relationships, rights, and
obligations, avoiding conflicts and guaranteeing better governance practices.

Investment funds

BNDESPAR resources may support start-ups and emerging firms through investment
funds managed by selected market managers chosen through a rigorous selection
process. BNDESPAR's activities through investment funds aim to develop innovative
firms and productive chains considered a priority by the bank while stimulating
entrepreneurship, encouraging the adoption of best practices in management and
corporate governance, and spreading the culture of venture capital in Brazil.
Investments should also present prospects for a return above BNDESPAR’s cost of
raising funds, contributing to the risk diversification of its asset portfolio.
As an investment fund quota holder, BNDESPAR analyzes the investment proposals
brought by managers just as it does direct investments, contemplating such aspects as
the firm’s economic and financial condition and projects, its market, governance and
management, risks and mitigating factors, and the structure of the proposed operation.

After the selection process, the winning bid is submitted to the BNDES system
framework of operations. Once framed, the proposal goes to the analysis phase, where
legal and managerial aspects are discussed as well as fund regulation. The feasibility of
the proposal is checked, and the winning manager has the burden of justifying it.
Subsequently, the winning proposal has its contracting submitted to the BNDESPAR
board.

Corporate debt securities

Corporate debt securities are securities issued by firms that seek to raise funds to
finance their investments and activities. To support the development of capital markets
and complement financing options for Brazilian firms, BNDES has products and
programs that encourage the issuance of fixed-income corporate bonds, such as simple
debentures. The bank supports the issuance of corporate debt securities through the
subscription of simple debentures and the acquisition of securities issued by Brazilian
capital firms. It offers three different modalities:
      Market debentures: to develop the secondary market of debentures and
       encourage the substitution of indexes for rates more appropriate to long-term
       financing;
      Infrastructure project debentures: for structuring investment funds in debentures
       of the infrastructure sector;
      External debt securities: for the acquisition of external bonds to support the
       strategies of growth and international insertion of Brazilian companies.
Further details for each modality below:

 Market Debentures
 Objectives
   Develop the secondary market for debentures;
   Encourage the replacement of the one-day DI-Over indexer with rates more
      adequate for long-term financing;
   Support long-term investments, especially in infrastructure;
   To shorten the BNDES analysis period, adapting it to the market needs.
 Mandatory allocation criteria
   Average minimum term of 48 months;
   In the deed of issue, the series under analysis may only contain an anticipated
      redemption forecast – at the issuer's sole discretion – in the last year before the
      maturity of the debenture;
   The debentures should have pricing and distribution defined through clear and
      transparent procedures, preferably through the collection of investment intent
      (bookbuilding);
   The deed of issue should only allow the possibility of renegotiation of the
      debenture’s terms after 48 months from date of issue.
 Percentage of resource allocation

                                           75
The maximum percentage of BNDES participation in issuing debentures will be 30% in
the series under analysis.
Additional mandatory criteria
   Minimum participation of 20% of shareholders’ funds in the financing of the
     project;
   Commitment to include in the debenture’s deed of issuance an early maturity
     clause due to default of financial obligations the issuer assumed or will assume
     in financing agreements entered into with BNDES; and
   Maturity of six years or more.
Infrastructure Projects Debentures
Description and Objectives
Seeking the feasibility of future structuring on investment funds in debentures for the
infrastructure sector, this modality seeks to compose a fixed-income securities
portfolio through the subscription by BNDES of simple debentures issued in public
offerings of up to R$300 million. At the same time, it is also a complementary source
of long-term resources for infrastructure projects.
Allocation
   R$5billion, rotating.

   Basic sanitation.
Remuneration
The remuneration of the debentures will be determined based on market rates for
compatible fixed-term and fixed-income securities.
Maturity period
   It may not be less than four years.
External Debt Securities
Objectives
Acting in the international primary market for acquisition of bonds issued by firms
with Brazilian capital and in the trading of these securities in the secondary market,
this modality aims to support Brazilian firms’ strategies of growth and international
insertion, alternatively or complementary to other BNDES products/programs.
Beneficiaries
   Firms with headquarters and administration in Brazil and national control;
   Foreign companies whose shareholder with the largest voting capital and
      exercising dominant influence over the activities performed therein, according
      to the judgment to be made by the BNDES, is:

                                          76
     o A legal entity directly or indirectly controlled by an individual or group of
          individuals domiciled and resident in the country; or
     o A firm controlled by a legal entity governed by public law.
Allocation
   US$ 1 billion for the constitution of the foreign securities portfolio.
   The total value of the portfolio may exceed the expected amount because of the
     valuation of external securities.

   Cannot be of the subordinate species.
Allocation of resources
Investments in foreign securities should be directed to firms that operate in sectors
supported by BNDES to finance:
   Investments in fixed assets in Brazil and abroad;
   Working capital required for the development of the issuing company;
   Research and development;
   Mergers and acquisitions in Brazil and abroad in cases where scale and scope
     gains arising from consolidation are important to boost subsequent growth;
   Restructuring and extension of debts for as long as necessary for the
     development of the issuing firm; and
   Purposes other than those described in the preceding paragraphs, provided that
     it is justifiable for the development of the issuing firm.
Maximum participation of BNDES
   BNDES 'participation in the acquisition of foreign securities will be up to 20% of
     the total amount of the issue.
   BNDES may only acquire foreign securities in the amount equivalent to 20% of
     the allocation of this modality by the economic group of the issuing firm.
Maturity period
   There are no restrictions on the maturity of external securities.
Warranties

Annex 7A – BNDES’ 2016 Operational Policy Details
BNDES’ financial support instruments are regulated and consolidated in the operating
policies (OPs), updated regularly. OPs consist of general and specific guidelines. The
general guidelines apply to most supported operations. Certain credit lines and
programs, as well as funds, have specific guidelines with their own regulations and
conditions.
General operation policy guidelines for BNDES’ products include the following
categories:

Firm sizes

BNDES classifies its beneficiaries by size to allow actions appropriate to the
characteristics of each segment, recognizing that specific conditions impact offers of
credit lines and programs. BNDES, for example, considers support for MSMEs a
priority, offering special conditions with the goal of facilitating their access to credit
firms.
The size classification is carried out according to gross operating income for firms or
annual income for households. The classification:

Medium-large firm
                                                 R$300 million
Large firm                                       Above R$300 million

Eligible financing items

The beneficiary may use BNDES financing for specific purposes, such as:
              Investments for implementation, expansion, modernization and/or recovery
               of firms, infrastructure, firms and public and private institutions, including
               studies, projects, civil works, installation, training;
              Production or acquisition of new machinery and equipment (including
               commercial vehicles, buses, trucks, and aircraft), national and accredited by
               BNDES;
              New goods, supplies, services, software;
              Working capital;
              Export of domestic goods and services; and
              Purchase of imported goods and services and internalization costs (through
               specific credit lines and conditions for this purpose), provided evidence of
               the lack of a similar national product.

Accreditation of machinery and equipment
To be financed by BNDES funds, machinery, equipment, systems, and components
must be registered in the bank’s Computerized Supplier Registration (CFI) and must
                                               83
present a minimum nationalization index of 60% in value and weight, calculated
according to criteria defined by BNDES, or comply with the Basic Productive Process
(PPB).
New goods, supplies, software, and services can be financed through the BNDES Card
to MSMEs. The BNDES Card has its own accreditation system. The accredited items
and accreditation information can be found on the BNDES Card Operations Portal.

Non-eligible items

Non-eligible sectors:
          Arms trade;
          Motels, saunas, and spas;
          Gambling;
          Banking/financial activity, except for the support of microcredit.

Non-eligible projects:
          Developments in the mining sector that incorporate basic process of mining;
          Social actions and projects included with tax incentives; and
          Real estate, such as residential buildings, commercial buildings for resale,
           commercial enterprises for office rentals, timeshares, hotel residences, and
           housing developments.

Non-eligible items:
          Land acquisition and expropriation;
          Any expenses involving remittance of foreign currency, including franchise
           fees paid abroad; and
          Purchase of animals for resale.

Types of operations

Beneficiaries may request funding directly from BNDES (direct support) or through
accredited financial institutions (indirect support or on-lending). The type of support
depends on the purpose and value of funding. In indirect support/on-lending, partner
financial institutions to BNDES act as intermediaries in providing financing and
assuming the credit risk (risk of non-payment by the customer), completely or in part.
As BNDES does not have branches, on-lending allows resources to reach beneficiaries
in all Brazilian municipalities through financial institutions.
Usually on-lending is used to support all financing operations for isolated purchases of
machinery and equipment; lower funding amounts – up to R$20 million; the
implementation, modernization, and expansion of projects; and other initiatives.
Above R$20 million, beneficiaries can deal directly with BNDES. In specific cases,
some credit lines and programs allow direct support on loan amounts below R$20
million.

                                           84
Indirect support/on-lending
The beneficiary searches for a BNDES-accredited financial institution (financial agent).
It is important to specify the investment amount, where items (spending) the funds will
be used, the purpose of the investment, and its location. The accredited financial
institution will review the necessary documentation, examine the possibility of
extending credit, and negotiate the financing conditions and guarantees.




               BENEFICIARY


In indirect operations, the analysis of the financing is done by the accredited financial
institution, which assumes the non-payment risk of the operation. Therefore, the
institution may accept or reject the application for credit. It also negotiates with the
client on the terms of financing, respecting certain rules and limits set by BNDES
(required term of payment and guarantees).
There are two types of indirect operations:
Automatic: The beneficiary does not need a prior assessment by BNDES. The funding
request is received and analyzed by the accredited financial institution, which then
requests release of funds to BNDES. Automatic financing operations include
transactions with an amount up to R$20 million.
Non-automatic: A prior consultation to BNDES is required, with the accredited
institution forwarding the application to the bank for analysis. In this case, the financing
operations are individually assessed and approved by BNDES. The minimum value for
this form of support is R$20 million.
Direct support
Direct support requests must be sent to the Department of Priorities (DEPRI/BNDES)
through financing models request templates available on the BNDES website.

                                              85
Direct financing for investment projects     REQUEST   is carried out through the BNDES
Finem product. Some funding programs                   that target specific economic
sectors or certain types of investments also offer direct support. To request direct
                  support, it is necessary, in general, that the funding amount be over
     BENEFICIARY  R$20 million. Both BNDES Finem and certain programs allow, in
                  some specific cases, direct support for funding values below this
limit.

Interest rates

The composition of the interest rates applicable to the beneficiary varies depending on
the type of support.
Indirect support/on-lending
In indirect support operations, the final interest rate reflects the sum of the following
items:
Financial cost + BNDES fee (basic BNDES fee + financial intermediation rate) + fee of
the financial agent (remuneration of the financial institution + credit risk rate)
Direct support
In direct support operations, the final interest rate reflects the sum of the following
items:
Financial cost + BNDES fee (basic BNDES + credit risk rate)

Financial cost
Reflects the cost of funding from BNDES in its various sources of funds. Determined
by each product, credit line, or program; it may be composed of one or more rates –
among others, TJLP and SELIC rates indexed to the IPCA (inflation). The rates can be
varied over the financing contract, generating a monetary restatement of contracted
amounts.
Basic BNDES fee
Reflects the remuneration of BNDES activity, covering administrative and operating
expenses. The Basic BNDES fee established in each product, credit line, or program is a
minimum benchmark.
Credit risk rate
Reflects the possibility of losses due to non-payment of part or all of the amounts owed
by the beneficiary (default). The customer risk rating is defined by the BNDES credit
policy as follows:
   a) For transactions secured by bank guarantee, the credit risk rate will be 0.5% per
      year.


                                           86
   b) For operations with states, federal districts, and municipalities, the credit risk
      rate will be 1% per year.
   c) No credit risk rate will be charged in transactions where the credit risk is
      assumed by the union.
In indirect operations, the fee of the accredited financial institution covers the credit risk
because this lender bears the risk of the operation.


Financial intermediation rate
Reflects the systemic risk of accredited financial institutions; i.e. the possibility of
BNDES suffering losses due to the crisis in the financial system. It is limited to 0.1%
per year for MSMEs and 0.5% per year for larger firms.
Accredited financial institution remuneration (fee)
Reflects the credit risk assumed by accredited financial institutions in indirect
operations as well as the remuneration of its activities. The remuneration is determined
at the sole discretion of the financial institution at the time of the transaction, and its
value is negotiated between the institution and the client.
Other fees/charges
In addition to the interest rates associated with the credit lines and programs, BNDES
may apply fees and charges for services rendered (see BNDES’ website for further
details).
There is also a fee charged for not using the outstanding balance of the financing
contract, called charge by credit reserve (0.1% for 30 days or incident fraction of the
value of credit or unused balance).

Maximum BNDES participation and terms

The maximum contribution corresponds to the limit on the portion that BNDES may
finance in the total amount of the items that can be purchased (and is, therefore,
characterized as a percentage of the value of eligible items). It is defined by each
product line or funding program.




                                             87
Note: Bankable investments, which are paid to BNDES by the customer before the
grant application protocol, may be considered in calculating the contribution of “own
resources? and should be part of the sources for the project, as follows:
          For micro firms, bankable investments paid in the 12 months prior to the
           grant application protocol may be considered in calculating the contribution;
          For other firms, bankable investments paid within six months prior to the
           protocol may be considered in calculating the contribution.

As for funding term (maturity), this will be determined according to the beneficiaries’
ability to pay, the firm, and the economic sector the firm belongs.

Guarantees

In indirect operations, guarantee requirements are negotiated between the accredited
financial institution and the beneficiary.
In direct operations, beneficiaries must provide collateral (such as mortgage, pledge,
fiduciary property, receivables, etc.) and/or personal guarantees (such as a security or
bond).
In general, BNDES requires real guarantees of 130% on the financed amount, but the
rate may be reduced to 100% when the beneficiary demonstrates a risk-rating level
higher than the minimum established at the discretion of BNDES and meets the
following conditions:
          Public firm with shares traded on the São Paulo Stock Exchange
           (BOVESPA), preferably listed on the Novo Mercado, or at levels 1 and 2 of
           corporate governance;
         BNDESPAR equity interest because, through the shareholders' agreement
           and/or participation in similar representative board of directors or
           committee, BNDESPAR effectively participates in the strategic decisions of
           the firm; or
         Submits financial statements verified by an independent auditing firm,
           registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the case of exports, through the BNDES Exim product, the beneficiary may provide
guarantees in banks overseas.
Investments Guarantee Fund - BNDES FGI
BNDES FGI is an instrument used to complement guarantees of indirect financing
operations, with the main objective to helping MSMEs as well as individual
entrepreneurs and self-employed truck drivers obtain credit. It also allows financing to
have better conditions, with longer maturities, lower entry requirements, and lower
interest rates.
For a loan with the guarantee of BNDES FGI, the beneficiary looks for a bank
authorized to operate with the fund's guarantee. The cost to use the BNDES FGI
guarantee is called the Guarantee Grant Fee (ECG), and its size depends on the amount
financed, the percentage guaranteed by the fund, and the maturity of the contract.

                                          88
Annex 7B – BNDES New Operational Policies

On January 5, 2017, BNDES announced its new operational policies with the criteria for
approval of new financing and the conditions for future loans. With this annoucement,
the bank concluded the process of reviewing its operational policies. New conditions for
airport and road modalities and for sanitation, mobility, and energy has been established
in September 2016.

The new policies reflect the changes in BNDES’ performance in its role as inducer of
sustainable development and the adoption of best practices in supported firms. The
priority is to grant greater incentives, with TJLP financing, to investments with returns
to society superior to those obtained by private investors, reconciling support for
projects that are relevant to the recovery of growth with significant social returns,
regardless of the sector in which they originate.

The changes are expected to contribute to increased productivity and competitiveness of
firms, economic growth, and job creation. They are also expected to (i) increase
transparency in funding criteria; (ii) improve project management; (iii) simplify forms
of support, with consolidation of programs and credit lines; (iv) become more agile in
lending processes; (v) provide feedback of the bank's activities through the
measurement and evaluation of projects; and to (vi) strengthen governance in BNDES-
supported institutions.

Operational policies will be reviewed annually. The transition aims to ensure that all
funding conditions are focused on the types of projects and not the sectors. The new
financing conditions begin to reflect attributes/qualifiers of supported projects and no
longer the sectorial logic the bank has been using. This is a relevant change that reflects
a horizontal performance of BNDES in its operational policies, affirming the bank's
priority of financing projects that present benefits to society and not only to
investor/borrower. The change is in line with the process of convergence among the
different sectors, which makes it increasingly difficult to define boundaries and,
therefore, use sectoral criteria in the granting of credit.

Highlights for the new operational policies include:

      Maximum BNDES financing participation: 80% of the investment;
      Limitation on the payment of dividends and interest on equity above 25% in
       financing, with 50% or more in TJLP;
      Expansion of access to government capital with direct operations (without
       financial agent intermediation) for financing starting at R$10 million;
      Expansion of access to credit;
      Expansion of access to guarantees;
      Maximum term for acquisition of machines and equipment extended from 60 to
       120 months.

                                            89
PRIORITIES

Investments in education, health, innovation, export, SMEs, and the environment, as
well as infrastructure projects, are priorities. The projects that fit these qualifiers will
receive better financing conditions (interest and terms).

As a result, projects from different sectors will receive similar conditions as long as they
fall under the same concept of defined qualifiers. Similar projects can be treated
differently depending on their environmental impact. An example is the production of
diesel engines in relation to the production of the same biodiesel equipment.

BNDES’ emphasis on supporting environmentally clean projects has already been
reflected in ending financing for coal-fired power plants; with the new measures, it is
now present in the larger portion of TJLP credit given to investments with green
technology. Hybrid, electric, or clean-fuel buses and trucks, for example, will have up to
80% TJLP financing. Financing for the commercialization of the same diesel-powered
vehicles will be a maximum of 50% in TJLP in 2017, decreasing over the next two
years to a maximum of 40% in 2018 and 30 % In TJLP in 2019 (for large firms).

TJLP

TJLP financing will have a greater selectivity to ensure better conditions for
investments with relevant impacts on job creation, productivity increases, and
improvements in the the population’s quality of life. Support for TJLP-funded projects
will be conditional on generating economic, social, environmental, and regional
benefits.

MONITORING & EVALUATION

To improve the measurement of the new impacts that BNDES hopes to achieve, the
bank created a Monitoring and Evaluation Department. All projects will have a “results
framework,? which will be previously defined goals to be achieved in financed projects.
These goals will be measured and, at the end, the project will have its impact assessed.

The bank will also use external evaluation services for large-scale infrastructure projects
(financing over R$1 billion), a practice already adopted by other international
development banks, and for projects in other sectors with loans exceeding R$500
million.

REVIEW OF PROCESSES

Funding processes are being reviewed and simplified, with more intensive use of
technology. With this, the bank seeks to reduce the internal-processing time, giving
greater agility to the operations.

KEY STRATEGIC GUIDELINES



                                            90
      Infrastructure - Participation remains relevant, with emphasis on sanitation and
       transportation projects due to their great socio-environmental externalities and
       impacts in increasing the country's competitiveness and productivity;
      Industry and Services - BNDES maintains its support to the industry, focusing
       on initiatives aimed at increasing productivity, competitiveness, innovation, and
       technology diffusion. The support will be horizontal, without distinction of
       sectors, but with a focus on the project;
      Export - Emphasis on the insertion of Brazilian firms into global value chains,
       stimulating productivity and competitiveness;
      Privatization - BNDES will act as the structuring body for the concession or
       privatization of federal and state assets. In this role, it will bring new financiers
       to make viable operations;
      Strengthening capital markets and corporate governance - Encouraging the
       development of Brazilian capital markets through instruments, such as
       debentures and funds, and promoting better corporate governance practices;
      Environment - Emphasis on alternative energies and environmental protection.
       Priority for highly effective projects that combine impact dimensions and
       economic, social, and environmental sustainability;
      Regional development - Objective is to increase BNDES presence in territories
       with large shares of the low-income population and the North and Northeast
       regions.


MAIN OPERATIONAL POLICIES CHANGES

1 – New credit lines for financing

BNDES now has two credit lines for direct and indirect non-automatic financing of
major projects in the Brazilian economy – the “incentivized line? (Linha Incentivada)
and “standard line? (Linha Padrão), both subdivided into incentive A and B and
standard A and B. Financing for infrastructure projects and indirect automatic financing
are not included in the two new lines.

The simplification of BNDES operational policies resulted from the consolidation of the
various financing instruments. The result was greater transparency in the bank's various
available credit options. In addition to eliminating overlaps of programs, products, and
credit lines, the merger allowed for greater synergy and use of resources.

Incentive Line - With the creation of this line, BNDES makes explicit the investments
considered priorities because of their greater positive impact on society. Ooperations
included in the incentivized line A will have the bank’s lowest cost of financing, with a
maximum of 80% of TJLP; investments in incentivized line B will have a maximum of
60% in TJLP.

Standard Line - This line covers all the projects not included in the incentivized line –
i.e., those with less expressive social returns. Standard A will provide financing of up to

                                            91
30% at the cost of TJLP. Standard line B operations will not have access to TJLP credits
and will receive resources at market rates.

Infrastructure Credit Line - During 2017, this credit line will partly continue with a
sectoral logic, although the energy sector has already been advanced by differentiating
the financing conditions for solar, hydro, and wind. New conditions are being
announced for: project financing railways, waterways, transport and distribution of gas
and biofuels, oil transportation, ports, and information and communication technology.
The current disclosure complements the already announced conditions for sanitation,
energy, highway, and airport projects.

2 – Strengthening corporate governance

BNDES will encourage financed firms to adopt good corporate practices. The effort
should cover issues related to improvements in firms intangible assets – among others,
governance, transparency, social and environmental management and practices, human
capital, innovative skills, and relationships with customers and suppliers. The initiative
extends credit operations to BNDESPAR's successful experience in creating value in the
capital market by encouraging best governance practices.

3 – Change in the size classification of MSMEs

The change in the MSMEs size classification – from R$90 million to R$300 million in
annual gross operating revenue – will increase this segment’s access to credit. It is
estimated that around 1,500 firms will be able to obtain financing under BNDES’ new
size classification.

In terms of MSMEs, here are some highlights for better access and simplification of
procedures:

        Change in the size classification of up to R$90 million for up to R$300 million
         of gross operating revenue;
        Access to financing of up to 80% of the investment in TJLP;
        Agility in the concession and improvement in the processes, a reduction from 30
         to two days until the end of 2017;
        BNDES Card: expansion of the credit limit from R$1 million to R$2 million;
        Extension of FGI guarantees;
        New distribution channels (second half of 2017);

                                                       93
      Launch of the BNDES Agro Card for rural producers, including households
       (second half of 2017);
      Expansion of access to working capital associated with purchases of machines
       and equipment;
      Launching of the BNDES MSME app (first quarter of 2017);
      Launching of an Internet portal for entrepreneurs (first half of 2017).

4 – Dividend distribution limitation

The new policy establishes restrictions on the payment of dividends – in addition to the
legal minimum of 25% – on the part of beneficiaries of TJLP loans equal to or greater
than 50% of total financing obtained. If the proportion of credit exceeds 50% of the total
in market cost, there will be no restriction on the payment of dividends.

One of the objectives is to ensure that BNDES financing generates additionalities in
investments – i.e., to drive good projects that would not happen without the bank’s
resources. The decision assumes that by accessing the bank’s credit, investors do not
have their own resources to finance the project and, therefore, cannot distribute
dividends beyond the legal minimum percentage.

5 – Working Capital – Progeren

The banking system’s reduction of credit supply for working capital led BNDES to
expand the “Support to Strengthening the Generation of Employment and Income
(BNDES Progeren)? line. Suppoer is now also available in the direct modality, without
the intermediation of financial agents.

The new line has a budget of R$5 billion and is effective, in principle, until the end of
2017. The minimum amount of financing is R$10 million per operation.

The new modality seeks to preserve economic activity and jobs in firms with limited
access to short-term credit. The line can also be accessed by anchor companies to
finance the development of supply chains and franchisees.

6 – Receivables as collateral

BNDES may accept the provision of collateral on receivables, including credit card
receivables, to increase access to credit for segments with a strong employment impact
that face constraints in obtaining financing (since having the actual guarantees is usually
required). This analysis will consider the risk of the firm/operation and the predictability
of its sales revenue.

BNDES AUTOMATIC (operations with values less than R$20 million)

Consolidation of previous programs into four financing lines:

        1 - Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, which will have priority financing of
         up to 80% in TJLP;
        2 - Large Incentive Company, with BNDES participation of up to 60% in TJLP
         if the project is in the incentive segments (energy, education, health, sanitation,
         food production, capital goods, and production of biofuels);
        3 - Large Standard Enterprise, with maximum participation of 80% at market
         rates, valid for all projects not included in the incentivized line;
        4 - Emergency Line, aimed at the economic resumption of firms located in
         municipalities affected by natural disasters, with 100% financing of TJLP
         investment.
These changes took effect from the issue of a circular letter to financial institutions in
early 2017. During the transition process, there will be no discontinuity of ongoing
operations.

BNDES FINAME

The financing term has been extended to 10 years, up from the previous five years. The
financing of machinery and equipment will have only three lines: acquisition of capital
goods, production, and modernization. FINAME will incorporate the FINAME

                                                     95
Agrícola product and extinguish FINAME Leasing. The cost will be fully in TJLP, and
the maximum BNDES participation will vary according to the priorities defined below.
        For acquisition of capital goods by large firms, the standard condition becomes
         the maximum participation of 60% in TJLP. The incentive conditions
         (maximum participation of 80% of TJLP) will be allocated exclusively to
         energy-efficient goods, including hybrid, electric, or clean-fuel buses and trucks.
        In the case of large firms’ acquisition of buses and diesel-powered trucks, the
         bank will gradually decrease its maximum TJLP participation from 50% in 2017
         to 40% in 2018 and at most 30% in 2019. The objective is to encourage
         purchases of trucks and buses that are less polluting and use cleaner fuels, such
         as electric and hybrid vehicles.

The same measures apply to MSMEs, but with different conditions for the gradual
reduction of participation in TJLP financing. The bank will reduce the TJLP maximum
for the purchase of diesel-powered buses and trucks from 80% in in 2017 to 70% in
2018 and 60% in 2019. Technology will maintain the maximum participation of 80% in
TJLP.

Annex 8 - Data Description
The BNDES contract-level data provide information on loans signed for (i) first-tier
loans and second-tier non-automatic products; and (ii) second-tier automatic products.
While data are available for contracts signed from 2002 to 2016, we have constrained
our analysis to 1,301 non-automatic contracts signed in 2015. Available data for
109,776 automatic contracts do not provide information need to calculate the size
distribution of firms and an equivalent level of sectoral disaggregation (they only record
which of the following products a loan is linked to – FINAME, FINAME Agricola,
FINAME Leasing, BNDES Automático). Both data provide information on loans
interest rates, loans basic interest rate indexes (whether it was TJLP, SELIC market rate,
fixed rates or others), warranty type, loan value, borrower identification, date and value
of loan contract, terms and grace period, borrower’s economic activity, and second-tier
financial intermediary.

   The transport-related activities division was not included because it includes activities related to the movement
and storage of cargo, either before or after its transportation, or between transport segments of different
modalities, the auxiliary activities of the various modes of transport involving the operation of the support
infrastructure on the highways, railways, airports, ports, bridges, tunnels, etc. and transportation agency activities.
This division also includes activities related to the organization of cargo transportation. Such activities do not
present clear positive externalities.

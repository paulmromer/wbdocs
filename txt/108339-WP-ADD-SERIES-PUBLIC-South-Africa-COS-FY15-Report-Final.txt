I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in South Africa perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing South Africa
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in South Africa
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From March to May 2015, 203 stakeholders of the WBG in South Africa were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, the Office of the Prime Minister; office
of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; non-profit organizations/community based organizations; the media;
independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of
83 stakeholders participated in the survey (41% response rate).

Respondents received and returned the questionnaires via email. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing South Africa; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in South Africa; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 14%, N=69). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’15 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 91).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
       agencies were combined with respondents from PMUs and consultants working on WBG
       supported projects; respondents from NGOs/community based organizations were
       combined with those from trade unions in the “CSO? category; and few respondents from
       the Office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a parliamentarian, independent
       government institutions, private sector organizations, financial sector/private banks, the
       media, and other organizations were included in the “Other? category. Note that there
       were no respondents from the office of a minister, private foundations, faith-based
       groups, youth groups, and the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey and the FY’12 country
        survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’15 = 6.2; weighted mean in FY’12 = 5.7)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in South Africa and the extent to
        which the WBG plays a relevant role in development in South Africa, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with their ratings of the extent to which the WBG helps to achieve
        development results in South Africa.

      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from bilateral/
       multilateral agencies, CSOs, and academia/research institutes/think tanks were
       significantly more likely to attribute failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to that
       “the WBG is not sensitive enough to political/social realities on the ground? compared to
       respondents from other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in South Africa,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the sixteen specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in South Africa. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at basic education;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at financial markets/inclusion; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at townships/informal settlements.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in South Africa, suggesting that
       ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
       ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
       these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at financial markets/inclusion;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at transport; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2015 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.

FY 2012 Number of comparable respondents = 57  FY 2015 Number of comparable respondents = 55

By weighting the FY 2012 data against the FY 2015 data based on the question about current position
(H1: stakeholder group), the two years’ data has the same stakeholder composition and thus is
comparable. Only stakeholder groups which were present in both years were included in the weighting
and analysis. Respondents from the “office of the president/Prime Minister,? “office of minister,?
“office of parliamentarian,? “PMU/consultants,? “private foundation s,? “media,? “independent
government institutions,? “trade unions,? “faith-based groups,? “youth groups,? “the judiciary branch?
were therefore not included in the analysis below. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented

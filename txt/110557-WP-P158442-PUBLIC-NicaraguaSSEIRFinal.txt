I.     Executive Summary

Overall: Despite strong outcomes across all social sectors, social spending in Nicaragua needs
to achieve efficiency gains in order to be sustainable. The recent deterioration of fiscal
accounts underlines the need for improved planning and monitoring of social spending.

Nicaragua has had decent economic growth in the past decade , which has contributed to
substantial poverty reduction (the largest in Central America), as well as improvements in
human development indicators. From 2001 to 2014, Nicaragua’s gross domestic product (GDP)
growth averaged 3.4 percent, which helped poverty decline from 48 percent in 2005 to 30 percent
in 2014. Importantly, Nicaragua has made improvements over the last fifteen years across almost
all human development indicators, and at a much faster rate than regional and comparator
countries. For instance, in education, Nicaragua increased enrollment and completion rates across
all levels, almost catching up with the Central American and Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)
averages. Similar improvements were seen in most health and social protection and labor (SPL)
indicators, though challenges remain regarding improving assisted deliveries and reducing
inequality and unemployment.

Many of these positive trends in human development indicators can be associated with the
increasing fiscal efforts towards improving social sector spending. As a share of GDP, social
public spending increased by a third between 2007 and 2014, highlighting an enormous fiscal
effort (from 10 percent in 2007, compared to 13.5 percent in 2014). During this period, social
public spending increased for all sectors, though health spending accounts for the largest share. As
of 2014, social spending in Nicaragua is almost at the Central America average of 13.9 percent,
though it is still among the lowest in the LAC region in per capita terms.

Fiscal accounts have deteriorated recently, which may pose some challenges to the
sustainability of current levels of financing for social sector expenditures. While the overall
fiscal situation in Nicaragua is better than most Central American countries, the consolidated
public sector deficit widened to 2 percent in 2014 after grants (and estimated at 2.7 percent of GDP
in 2015). This was largely due to a decline in loans provided to the private sector in concessional
terms originating from the oil subsidies from Venezuela and the recent deterioration in the fiscal
balance of state-owned enterprises. The deterioration of fiscal accounts will likely limit the
possibilities for further increases in social sector spending, and may require cuts in order to ensure
fiscal sustainability in the coming years.

Better planning and monitoring of social spending are needed to improve Nicaragua’s
budget management. While Nicaragua has a medium-term development plan, the use of results-
oriented budget formulation is still in its early stages. There is space to improve and expand current
efforts of planning and budgeting for results beyond a few ministries (health and education) to all

social sectors. Greater transparency in budget execution would allow room for more effic ie nt
spending, as historically, only approved budgets are made available to policymakers and the
public, as opposed to information on the use of funds and results achieved. While information on
annual budget execution for capital expenses can be easily tracked, tracking of recurrent
expenditures is extremely difficult.

Education: Low and inefficient public spending in education, coupled with outdated legal
and institutional frameworks and high dropout rates present are significant barriers to
increasing enrollment and providing quality education.

Although almost stable as a percentage of GDP, public education spending in Nicaragua has
increased in real terms but is still heavily biased towards tertiary education, where efficiency
gains can still be achieved. In real terms, public spending on education increased steadily between
2007 and 2014. Also during this period, education spending as a percentage of GDP was largely
stable around 4 percent. Overall, per capita education spending averaged 7,112 cordobas (US$246)
in 2014, of which 30 percent went to tertiary education. Moving forward, the country has
opportunities to rebalance its education spending by reallocating spending into basic education,
while also ensuring more efficient spending at the tertiary level (where access is still
disproportionally from the higher income groups). Ongoing progress in improving the efficie nc y
of basic education spending is an encouraging sign. Recent increases, have been driven mainly by
the increase in basic education attainment.

Despite gains in basic education attainment, completion rates are still low when compare d
with peer countries. Furthermore, learning outcomes continue to be among the lowest in Central
America. Policies implemented since 2008 have contributed to improved access and retention in
basic education (grades 1 to 9), as well as to increased educational attainment of the population as
a whole. However, completion rates for both primary and secondary school remain quite low in
comparison to other Central American countries. Dropouts especially at late primary and lower
secondary may be related to the prevalence of over age students, whose population has grown due
to high repetition rates. Secondary school dropouts are likely driven by a lack of interest in school
and/or by economic reasons. In addition, secondary school might not be sufficiently attractive for
students due to an outdate curricula and the lack of technical and vocational education options.
Despite having the most equitably distributed learning outcomes, in Central America, Nicaragua
has some of the lowest Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (TERCE) results in
the LAC region.

Large inequalities remain with respect to access to both secondary education and highe r
education, with the former disproportionately affecting populations in rural areas and the
Caribbean Coast and the latter restricted to smaller share of better of students . Primary
school public expenditure is fairly progressive, while public tertiary education expenditure is
highly regressive. There are large gaps in access to secondary and post-secondary education across


                                                 11

income groups. For example, access to education is particularly low in the Caribbean Coast, where
the majority of Afro-descendants and indigenous communities live. In rural areas, entrance to the
formal education system usually takes place when children are older, and access to secondary
education is lower compared to urban areas. Despite being behind peers in learning outcomes, the
correlation between learning outcomes and income in Nicaragua is among the lowest in the region,
suggesting that the system is reasonably efficient in providing equal opportunities. In addition, the
learning gap between private and public schools is also small, becoming almost negligible for
public schools in urban and rural areas. However, there are large disparities in learning outcomes
across regions of the country.

In moving forward, the Government of Nicaragua could consider the following
recommendations in the education sector:

Short term:
 Prioritize increasing the completion of basic education (grades 1 to 9) through a combinatio n
   of “supply side” and “demand side” policies;
 Prioritize spending, particularly for access to preschool and secondary education in rural areas
   (i.e. school infrastructure, learning materials), in order to reduce the number of dropouts, help
   close the learning gaps, and improve access for those in more remote areas;
 Foster more cost effective “demand side” policies (increasing the immediate retur ns of
   schooling or the student’s effort), such as the development of a comprehensive strategy to
   make secondary education (including pedagogies and curriculum) more attractive for young
   teenagers;
 Undertake a more rigorous assessment/diagnostic on the causes of dropouts in lower secondary
   and consider coupling it with more comprehensive packages to address them (building on
   existing measures);
 Enhance current reforms in teacher policy through effective professional development and
   incentive programs;
 Revise the duration/ curriculum/ formats of teacher training to prioritize the improvement of
   mastery of contents, classroom management and developing strategies for keeping students
   engaged; and
 Consider increasing teacher wages as a mechanism to strengthen performance and increase
   accountability and monitoring and evaluation of educational results/performance ; low
   incentives and poor career development opportunities of the community preschool teachers
   should be treated as a priority.

Medium-term:
   Make the curriculum for basic education more relevant;
   Revise the basic education curriculum to consolidate selected programs and strategies already
    being implemented by the Government, to ensure coordination across education levels, and to
    facilitate the adaptation of contents to the needs of different groups;

   Conduct a thorough assessment of the existing legal framework and revise it (as needed) to
    ensure that the institutional framework supports the current educational strategies;
   Reinforce the coordination and collaboration of education actors across all levels of the system;
    and
   Increase access to public educational information supporting all actors/ players to contribute
    effectively towards the improvement of the national education system.

Health: Progress in key areas such as child and maternal mortality, but lowest per capita
health spending in Central America, as well as institutional and governance challenges limit
coverage and quality of services.

While Nicaragua’s public spending on health has increased, it still remains low, suggesting
the need to improve efficiency of spending due to existing fiscal constraints. In Nicaragua,
both public spending on health as a share of GDP and as a share of total public social sector
spending have increased. However, per capita public spending on health in real terms has remained
the same from 2007 to 2014. By this measure, it remains among the lowest of Central America
and LAC countries, and tends to be lower than countries with similar incomes/characteristics. In
addition, while the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud, MINSA) has a lower per capita
expenditure compared to other major health institutions in Nicaragua, it covers an estimated 76
percent of the population. Given the country’s existing fiscal envelope, the Government could
consider increasing available funds for the health sector by: (i) introducing new public policies to
generate revenues for the health sector, such as taxation of sweetened drinks, and reviewing and
strengthening the implementation of existing policies, such as tobacco taxation; and (ii) improving
public spending efficiency in the health sector by promoting greater intra- and inter-institutio na l
coordination between MINSA and the Nicaraguan Social Security ( Instituto Nicaragüense de
Seguridad Social, INSS). In addition, MINSA could improve the use of budgeting allocatio ns
based on results achieved at the main hospitals and reference hospitals in the country.

The relatively balanced spending on hospitals and primary care programs (45 percent and
43 percent, respectively), coupled with the strong leadership of MINSA , has contributed to
improved outcomes, but some challenges remain. In particular, child and maternal mortality
rates and chronic malnutrition have decreased, while life expectancy has increased. However,
challenges remain with regard to certain outcomes and in closing coverage gaps. Nicaragua needs
to continue to address maternal mortality and to pay close attention to the incidence of
transmissible diseases, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the increasing threat
of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). While out of pocket spending as a share of total health
spending has decreased on average, the Government needs to continue to reduce disparities in
access to services between urban and rural areas and across income quintiles.

While progress has been made in ensuring strong institutional and governance of critical
interventions, challenges remain. To date, MINSA has demonstrated the ability to successfu lly


                                                 13

deliver critical health services rooted firmly at the community level through the Family and
Community Health Care Model (Modelo de Salud Familiar y Comunitario, MOSAFC). However,
despite advances and achievements, a few aspects related to quality of care continue to present
challenges, including the need to: (i) perform systematic reviews of health results to ensure
the effectiveness of the health care system and the functioning of the health network; (ii) improve
efficiency by ensuring the optimal use of available resources to yield maximum benefits or results;
and (iii) ensure that the health system is sufficiently responsive to adjust the provision of services
to serve people with different cultural beliefs.

Multi-sectoral efforts and policy changes are also needed to address some existing health
sector challenges. Such efforts require high level mandate, strategies and sufficient budget to
implement. For example, first, the inter-sectoral collaboration between the Ministry of Education
(Ministerio de Educación, MINED), the Ministry of the Family (Ministerio de la Familia,
Adolescencia, y Niñez, MIFAN) and the Ministry of Youth (Ministerio de Juventud, MINJUVE)
through the implementation of the Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health Strategy
(Estrategia de Salud y Desarrollo Integral para Adolescentes, ENSDIA) needs to evolve to
include developing integrated programs to prevent and address the effects of adolescent pregnancy.
Second, the health sector is investing in assessing and managing hospital waste in Managua’s
hospitals, which has fostered a dialogue on non-hazardous waste management and the disposal of
hazardous waste. However, more action on the part of the municipalities and the Environme nta l
National Agency (Ministerio del Ambiente y Los Recursos Naturales, MARENA) is needed to
ensure the proper management of hazardous waste, particularly in public disposal places with a
high potential for population exposure. Third, the health sector could take a leadership role in
strengthening and incentivizing a multi-sectoral response to chronic diseases and trauma. While
there is a need to continue to proactively address these challenges through health-specif ic
interventions, interventions from other sectors would be essential to effectively implement public
policies that address NCD and trauma/violence related risk factors and delay or prevent the cases.

In moving forward, the Government of Nicaragua could consider the following
recommendations in the health sector:

Short term:
   Evaluate the 10 year implementation experience MOSAFC, particularly with regard to the functioning
    of the health care network and quality of care;
   Strengthen MINSA’s capacity to regulate the drug supply chain and access to drugs, and improve drug
    availability particularly at the primary care level;
   Include a budget line in MINSA for the maintenance, prevention and repair of medical and non-medical
    equipment; and
   Introduce new public policies to generate revenues for the health sector, such as taxation of sweetened
    drinks, and review and strengthen the implementation of existing policies, such as tobacco taxation.

Medium-term:
   Develop, cost, and implement a coordinated strategy to address risk factors and improve provision of
    preventive and curative services for chronic diseases and trauma cases in all municipalities, led by
    MINSA;
   Prepare and implement a master plan to strengthen pharmaceutical management and develop an
    integrated public policy on medicines;
   Improve inter-institutional coordination between MINSA and INSS, including integrating the
    prevention and promotion practices put in place by MINSA and reviewing cross subsidies perceived
    by the provisional institutions working for INSS; and
   Improve the use of results-based budgeting allocations to main and reference hospitals in the country
    (MINSA).

Social Protection: There is need for increased spending in social assistance interventions ,
better coordination among implementing agencies, and revised targeting to ensure decent
coverage of programs among the poorest.

Though spending in SPL has increased in recent years, mainly due to social security
spending, Nicaragua still trails other countries in Central America and LAC. SPL spending
as a share of GDP grew from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 4.4 percent in 2014. Recent increases
in social security spending are largely due to the implementation of a pension reform to introduce
a reduced proportional age pension. Efforts to increase social assistance also took place, mainly in
terms of subsidies. However, compared to other countries in Central America, Nicaragua’s SPL
spending in social assistance is the lowest. This is partly explained by the lack of explicit budget
allocation to the National System of Social Welfare (Superintendencia Nacional de Bienes
Estatales, SNBS). In addition, as opposed to its neighbors, Nicaragua does not allocate resources
to cash transfer programs, though it is the country that spends the most in active labor market
programs (ALMPs) in Central America.

While social security coverage has increased, Nicaragua is still one of the countries with the
lowest contributions to the social security system in LAC and sustainability issues remain.
The share of employees contributing to the social security system has increased from 18 percent
in 2001 to 26 percent in 2014. While this is greater than those in Guatemala and Honduras,
Nicaragua’s share of contributing employees are still very low compared to other countries in
LAC. Correspondingly, the share of the elderly that benefit from social security has increased from
less than 10 percent in 2001 to 24 percent in 2014, although participation among the poor it is
barely 6 percent. In 2014, after a wide multi-sectoral dialogue and consensus among employees,
employers and unions, the Government undertook a reform of the pay-as-you-go system to address
fiscal sustainability issues. However, it failed to deliver results due to policy changes.
Consequently, the INSS is projected to start running persistent deficits by 2017, and the reserve
fund is expected to be depleted by 2024. In this context, it is critical to undertake measures to
guarantee pension system sustainability, and consider the potential extension of social pensions to
those currently without assistance, namely the poor.

In addition to social security, social assistance has also expanded through subsidies and social
care programs. Moving forward, it is critical to understand their cost-effectiveness and impact of
such programs. In recent years, Nicaragua has expanded the coverage of social assistance and
social care services, through flagship programs, such as Merienda Escolar, Mochila Escolar, and
Programa Amor. In general, these programs have decent coverage in rural areas, among extreme
poor, and among those in the lowest quintile. However, targeting accuracy could be improved, as
around 50 percent of social assistance beneficiaries do not belong to the poorest two quintiles of
the consumption distribution due to the universal nature of many of these flagship programs. In
addition, while preliminary data suggests that these programs have had an impact on poverty
among beneficiaries, no proper cost-benefit analysis or impact evaluation has been carried out,
making it difficult to ascertain the true level of impact or understand potential opportunities for
improvements. Improving effectiveness of social assistance and social care interventions call for
investing in monitoring and evaluation. For instance, it would be important to complete the impact
evaluation assessment of Programa Amor soon in order to document its achievements and inform
potential adjustments.

In contrast to the majority of countries in the region, Nicaragua does not currently have a
national cash transfer program. However, lessons from the highly impactful Red de Protección
Social could be broadly incorporated into the design of social protection policies. In addition,
having strengthened the supply-side of providing basic services, it may be a good time to
reconsider transforming some untargeted/regressive subsidies into social cash transfer
interventions and ALMPs and employability strategies to explicitly target the poorest.

With respect to the relatively high unemployment rate, Nicaragua has made important
efforts into expanding its ALMPs. Nicaragua spends more than any other country in Central
America on ALMPs, or approximately 0.5 percent of its GDP. The key ALMPs are Usura Cero,
which provides access to credit, in-kind transfers, and training programs for women, and services
provided by the National Technological Institute (Instituto Nacional Tecnológico, INATEC). Most
of these programs target the youth (who are prone to high unemployment) and those typically
employed in the informal sector or self-employed, or support agricultural production.

However, a thorough revision of the appropriateness, financing source, and profiling of
ALMPs participants is due. In reality, few of the vulnerable groups benefit from this type of
interventions, which highlights the need for an explicit and dedicated focus on reaching vulnerab le
groups. Data for 2014 shows that only 7 percent of the unemployed had taken a training course in
the last year, and that most beneficiaries belong to the upper well-being levels. One possibility to
consider is combining provision of training, cash transfers, and entrepreneurship promotions into
a “poverty- graduation” model. Organizations such as BRAC have shown success in using this type




                                                16

of approach to help transition populations out of extreme poverty effective in lifting out of extreme
poverty a large proportion of population (Banerjee et al, 2015).

Despite a major shift in vision in terms of Social Protection policy since 2007, fragmentation
remains an important challenge. Since the early 2000s, there have been a number of SPL policy
shifts in Nicaragua. Key milestones achieved include the enactment of the National Social
Protection Policy (NSPP) in 2003 and the design of the Solidarity System for Development in
2006. However, in light of limited results in terms of poverty reduction, the SPL policy formula tio n
and vision took an important turn in 2007 with the incoming Administration. This policy focused
on the restitution of rights of poor families, centered on an overarching commitment to the common
good, social equity and shared responsibility for the development of the Nicaraguan families. To
support this new approach, SNBS constituted and coordinated by the Secretary of the Council of
Communication and Citizenship for Social Development (Secretaría del Consejo de
Comunicación y Ciudadanía para el Desarrollo Social) and with the participation of all ministr ies
working in social development and welfare programs. Still, fragmentation remains a challenge,
since the institutions that comprise the SNBS are very large and heterogeneous, which may hamper
policy planning and efficiency. This calls for a potential revision of the operating framework and
mechanisms for the implementation of the SNBS, as well as a consolidation of interventio ns
among fewer implementing agencies, since isolated interventions have limited potential of
impacting in poverty reduction and create substantial fiscal pressure.

Efforts to improve coordination at the local level should also be strengthened. Finalizing and
digitalizing the mapping of actors with the sector could help improve coordination. The operation
of a multi-sectoral system, such as the SNBS, necessitates a high level of dynamism and the ability
to quickly respond to the needs of the population. This requires, among other things, a record of
institutional actors (with their location and inventory of available services). Building from this,
close inter-agency coordination, participation, and communication strategies could enable an
effective system of referral and counter-referral to meet the different demands of the community.
To this end, current efforts underway at MIFAN could be completed and implemented in other
line ministries. In addition, and to maximize the impact of the programs of the SNBS, it would be
important to prioritize care in communities with the highest incidence of extreme poverty, the
highest exposure to natural disasters, and unmet basic needs (in both rural and urban areas).
Finally, the multi-sectoral approach for the integral delivery of services to selected population
(such as children, youth or the elderly) should be systematized and developed further.

Finally, more needs to be done to improve monitoring and evaluation and accountability
mechanisms of social protection programs. Monitoring efforts and use of analysis to make
decisions based on statistics is still lacking, highlighting an important area of focus to improve
quality and efficiency in the decision making processes. In contrast to other countries in Central
America and LAC, Nicaragua has not yet developed a unique registry of beneficiaries across

implementing institutions that can allow better coordination of interventions and strengthen its the
focus on the poor, though efforts have started in MIFAN. Finalizing this effort will be critical, as
will updating the 2005 poverty map with the 2014 Living Standards Measurement Study (Encuesta
sobre Medicion de Niveles de Vida, EMNV). Finally, Government policies also reflect the need
for improved controls and implement social audits, which are considered a pillar of participatory
governance. However, these still need to be implemented on a broader scale and publicly
disseminated.

II.                       Context

Nicaragua’s economic growth over the past fifteen years has been moderate, with a slight
acceleration over the past five years. From 2001 to 2015, Nicaragua’s GDP growth averaged 3.6
percent, slightly below the Central American average of 3.9 percent for the same period (Figure
1). Nicaragua was one of the countries most affected by global food, fuel, and financial crisis in
the LAC region (along with El Salvador and Honduras). In 2009, GDP declined by 2.4 percent.
However, thereafter GDP growth increased, averaging 4.7 percent over the 2010 to 2015 period,
slightly surpassing the LAC region average of 4.2 percent.

By 2014, this economic growth had contributed to the most substantial poverty reduction in
Central America and slowed the growth of inequality in Nicaragua. Nicaragua was one of the
poorest countries in the LAC region in the 1990s. In 1993, half of the population was living below
the national poverty line, while in rural areas poverty rates reached over 75 percent. Poverty
remained relatively stagnant until 2005, when it started to decline faster than in previous years.
Between 2005 and 2014, the poverty headcount declined from 48 to 30 percent (Figure 2). This


                                                                18

reduction was seen in rural and urban areas alike. Rural poverty showed a significant decline from
70 to 50 percent, while urban poverty was cut in half, declining from 31 to 15 percent. Despite the
significant progress made in reducing poverty, inequality slightly increased during this period, as
Nicaragua’s Gini coefficient grew from 45.7 in 2009 to 47.1 in 2014. Importantly, inequality in
Nicaragua grew at a slower rate than all other Central American countries apart from El Salvador
(Figure 3).1

In addition to the important progress made in reducing poverty, Nicaragua also saw
improvements in a number of human development indicators. Table 1 compares trends in key
education, health and SPL indicators with three comparator groups: i) the top 7 economies in the
LAC region;2 ii) the Central America region (excluding Nicaragua); and iii) a set of 6 countries

around the world that can be considered “comparator countries” based on certain criteria. 3 While
LAC and Central American countries broadly have better indicators, Nicaragua has made
improvements across almost all human development indicators over the last fifteen years, and at a
much faster rate than regional and comparator countries. For instance, in education, Nicaragua
increased enrollment and completion rates across all levels, almost catching up with the LAC and
Central American averages. In health, good progress was made on almost all indicators, except for
the average share of assisted deliveries, which decreased during the 2007-2014 period compared
to 2000-2016. In SPL, Nicaragua showed important improvements in employment and female
labor force participation, though unemployment rates increased slightly during this period. As will
be seen in the following sections, many of these positive trends in human development indicators
can be associated with Nicaragua’s efforts to both increase and improve efficiency of social sector
spending.

III.    Recent Trends in Social Public Spending in Guatemala

Nicaragua’s social public spending as a share of GDP increased from 10 to 23.5 percent
between 2007 and 2014 (Figure 4). Growth over this period highlights the enormous fiscal effort
made by the Government to increase investments in all social sectors, with social security
increasing proportionally the most (84 percent), followed by social assistance (67 percent). Health
spending accounted for the largest share of both GDP and all social public spending, reaching 5.1
percent and 38 percent, respectively. Over the 2007 to 2014 period, the largest increases in social
public spending as share of GDP happened over two one-year periods. In 2009, it increased from
10.5 to 12 percent, which was largely explained by the decline in GDP rather than increase in
absolute spending. In 2014, spending increased from 12.5 to 13.5 percent, which was particular ly
remarkable because it was a year in which GDP grew by 3.4 percent.

While Nicaragua’s social spending as a percent of GDP is close to the average for Central
America, in per capita terms it is among the lowest in LAC. Nicaragua spends 13.5 percent as
a share of GDP, putting it behind Costa Rica and Honduras and close behind Panama (Figure 5).
In terms of sectoral breakdown, Nicaragua allocated a larger share of its GDP to health (5.1
percent) than all other countries in the region except for Costa Rica. Despite the recent increase in
budget allocation to social assistance and labor programs, Nicaragua’s allocations are the lowest
in Central America (0.9 percent), while education (4.0 percent) and social security spending (3.5
percent) rank around the average for Central America. However in terms of per capita spending,
Nicaragua spends less on social sectors than all countries in LAC with available information except
for Bolivia (Figure 6). This is not surprising though, as Nicaragua has one of the lowest GDP per
capita in the region.

Overall, Nicaragua’s social public spending is not progressive mainly due to social security
benefits, since coverage is only meaningful among the upper levels of the income distributio n.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of social public spending by sectors and quintiles (Q1 being the
poorest quintile, Q5 the richest). Public spending on health appears to be mainly allocated to the
first three income quintiles, with a much smaller amount allocated to the richest quintile. The

distribution of education spending follows a similar pattern, although with less variation across
income quintiles compared to health. Social assistance and labor interventions (cash transfers,
disability benefits, etc.) seems to be mostly allocated to the middle income quintiles, while social
security spending appears to be regressive, increasing based on income levels.

    we considered the distribution of public students enrolled in each level of education by income quintile. For health,

    we considered the distribution of pension beneficiaries by income quintiles and, for social assistance, the

Fiscal accounts have deteriorated recently, which may pose some challenges to maintaining
current levels of social sector expenditures. While the overall fiscal situation in Nicaragua is
better than most Central American countries, the consolidated public sector deficit widened to 2
percent in 2014 after grants (and estimated at 2.7 percent of GDP in 2015). This was largely due
to a decline in concessional loans provided to the private sector from Venezuelan oil subsidies and
the recent deterioration of the fiscal balance of state-owned enterprises.4 The Internatio na l
Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest projections are also worrisome, with the fiscal deficit potentially
accounting for 2.5 percent of GDP in 2016. The increase in the deficit is mostly due to an increase
in spending (in particular, capital spending) beyond the increase in revenues (Figure 8). The
deterioration of fiscal accounts will likely limit the possibilities for further increases in social
sector spending and, more likely, result in a need for cuts in spending in order to achieve fiscal
sustainability in the coming years.

Better planning and monitoring of social spending are critical to improving Nicaragua’s
budget management. While Nicaragua has a medium-term development plan elaborated by the
Technical Secretariat of Citizen Power (Secretaria Técnica del Poderl Ciudadano, SETEC), the
links to results-oriented budget formulation are not yet strongly developed. A few ministr ies
(health, education) have made progress in improving planning and budgeting for results, for
example by using performance-linked indicators. However, such efforts could be improved and/or
expanded to all social sectors to improve the targeting, efficiency, and impact of social spending.
While monitoring and evaluation norms are in place, a strong system should be put in place that
can provide feedback to the public management process that can be externally assessed.
Transparency in budget execution also has room for improvement. Although the annually
approved budget is largely available to the public and information regarding budget execution for
capital expenses can be easily tracked, this is not the case for current expenditures.

While efficient, Nicaragua’s public social public spending is less effective compared to other
LAC countries. Figure 9 shows a comparison between the levels of Public Sector Performance
(PSP) and Public Sector Efficiency (PSE) in Nicaragua and other LAC countries. The PSP is a
composite indicator based on socioeconomic variables that are assumed to be the output of public
policies. This indicator summarizes the effectiveness of public spending in improving social
outcomes. The PSE indicator then relates PSP scores to the total public spending in these sectors.
It represents the “public value” per public dollar spent. The overall assumption behind the
assessment of public sector performance and efficiency employing PSP and PSE indicators is that
the observed outcome indicators are solely the result of public spending policies (Box 1 provides
additional information on the PSP and PSE analyses). Based on this analysis, Nicaragua’s public
spending was found to be efficient (“value” per dollar spent) in all sectors, but was not considered
effective (in improving outcomes) compared to other LAC countries. This means that Nicaragua

is among the countries with lower results in terms of social indicators 5 without taking into
consideration the costs incurred to achieve them. However, this also means that Nicaragua gets a
higher return (improvement in social indicators) per dollar of social public spending compared to
other countries.

%; percentage of population age 25+ with completed secondary schooling), health (maternal mortality ratio, national
estimate per 100,000 live births; measles as % of children aged 12-23 months) and social protection and labor (GINI

                  Box 1: Public Sector Performance and Public Sector Efficiency Indicators
    We analyzed the relationship between social outcomes and spending using the PSP and PSE approaches
    developed by Afonso, Schuknecht, and Tanzi (2005, 2010). 6

    PSP is measured by constructing composite indicators based on observable social variables that are
    assumed to be the output of pursued social public policies. Specifically, the PSP for country  = 1, … , 
    with  = 1,2,3 social sectors (education, health and social protection and labor) is determined by:
                              

                   = ∑  ;  = 1, … ; ℎ  =  ( ), = 1, … , .      (1)
                            =1

    where ( ) is a function of k observable social indicators (for education, we take gross secondary
    enrollment and literacy rate; for health, we take maternal mortality and immunization rates; and for social
    protection and labor, we use inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) and extreme poverty
    headcount (percentage of population earning less than US$1.25 a day). To obtain PSP indicators, we
    assign equal weights to each sub-indicator, computed as the average of the corresponding outcome
    indicators, each one of them normalized by its sample mean. The PSP indicator for each country is then
    obtained by averaging the values of all sub-indicators. Resulting PSP scores are then related to the
    average value of one of the normalized output indicators. Hence, countries with PSP scores in excess of
    one are seen as good performers, as opposed to countries with PSP values below the mean.

    PSE relates PSP scores to their cost in terms of public spending. PSE weights public sector performance
    in each social sector by the amount of relevant public expenditure that is used to achieve such
    performance. To compute PSE scores, public spending in each sector is normalized across countries,
    taking the average value of one for each of the expenditure categories ( j). This is, for each country
     = 1, … ,  with  = 1,2,3 social sectors, the PSE is defined by:

                                                     Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


A LAC production possibility frontier analysis shows that it is possible for Nicaragua to
improve its performance with the same level of spending. Figure 10 shows the production
possibility frontier for total social public spending for LAC, applying the data envelope analysis
(DEA) using the PSP scores as an output and social-public spending-to-GDP ratios as an input.
Our results show that the efficiency frontier is essentially defined by Ecuador, Peru and Chile.
Nicaragua is far away from the efficiency frontier and could potentially increase its performance
by 13 percent with the same level of spending. The analysis in the next chapters highlights concrete
ways in which Nicaragua could achieve such efficiency gains and improve the quality of outcomes
in a wide set of areas across the three social sectors.

                                        Box 2: DEA Methodology
 The DEA methodology, developed by Farrell (1957), assumes the existence of a convex
 production frontier to construct an envelope around the set of observations. DEA compares each
 unit with all other units, and identifies those units that are operating inefficiently compared with
 other units' actual operating results. DEA presents two approaches: 1) the input-oriented shows
 by how much input quantity can be proportionally reduced without changing the output
 quantities; 2) the output-oriented assesses how much output quantities can be proportionally
 increased without changing the input quantities used. Efficiency for each unit can be measured
 by computing the distance to the theoretical efficiency frontier (or compared to the best practice
 units). DEA provides an efficiency rating that is generally denominated between zero and 1,
 which will interchangeably be referred to as an efficiency percentage between the range of zero
 and 100 percent. The best practice units are relatively efficient and are identified by a DEA
 efficiency rating of  = 1 . The inefficient units are identified by an efficiency rating of less than
 1 ( < 1). The figure below illustrates the single input single output DEA production possibility
 frontier. Countries A, B and C are efficient with output scores equal to 1. On the other hand,
 country D is not efficient, since its score [d2/(d1+d2)] is below unity.

IV. Performance and Challenges in Education

IV.1       Recent Evolution of Education Public Spending

As a percentage of GDP, public spending in education in Nicaragua has been relatively stable
in recent years. Between 2007 and 2009, spending as a percent of GDP grew from 3.8 percent to
4.2 percent. It then declined slightly to 3.7 percent in 2011/12, before increasing slightly to 4
percent in 2014 (Figure 11). By this metric, education spending remains low in comparison to
other countries in Central America (Figure 13). However, in real terms, public spending on
education has been steadily increasing over the same period, with an average of 4.7 percent growth
per annum, for a cumulative increase of 33.2 percent (Figure 12). Importantly, the share of total
education spending financed with national resources also increased over this period. 7 In real terms,
education spending in Nicaragua is already above some Central American countries (Guatemala,
El Salvador, Panama), and even some South American countries (Peru, Ecuador). Even though the
latter generally have even larger tax bases, Nicaragua’s comparative position is a sign that the
education sector is already at a reasonable spending level.




7   While external resources accounted for 17 percent of MINED budget in 2008, this declined to 5 percent in 2014.

As a percent of total government expenditure, education spending has declined since 2009.
Table 2 shows that education expenditures as a percentage of total government expenditure
declined significantly, by 1.3 percentage points between 2007 and 2014, from 17.1 to 15.8 percent,
respectively.8 A large part of this decline is explained by the reduction in the share of governme nt

funds allocated to higher education, which declined from 5.4 percent in 2007 to 4.6 percent in
2014. The portion dedicated to basic education (preschool, primary and secondary) has oscillated
between a maximum of 10.1 percent in 2007-2008 and a minimum of 8.7 percent in 2012. Since
2012, it has recovered slightly and stood at 9.9 percent in 2014. Overall, the total education
expenditure was affected by the fiscal adjustment following the 2009 crisis. In recent months, the
Government has begun to replace declining external resources, but there remains space to devote
additional national resources to education in the future.

The composition of public spending in education has been reasonably stable , but is somewhat
biased towards tertiary education. As Figure 14 shows, tertiary education represented around
30 percent of public education expenditure between 2007 and 2014, while secondary education
accounted for an average of 8 percent over this period. 9 Relative to other Central American
countries, public spending on tertiary education in 2014 was quite high (29 percent), while shares
of spending allocated to preschool and secondary school are lower in Nicaragua than most other
countries (Figure 15). The share of spending dedicated to higher education is even more
impressive, as higher education enrollment only accounts for 8 percent of total enrollments, while
about 70 percent of public per student spending goes to tertiary education (this is not reported, but
can be seen from Figures 16 and 17). Furthermore, the large difference in spending in primary
versus secondary levels is likely partly overstated due to official imputation of (mainly personnel)
expenditures in preschool and secondary compared to primary expenditures. The latter currently
accounts for 49 percent of the overall budget. 10 In 2014, MINED expenditures accounted for 2.8

9 Through the report we use “Basic education” as equivalent to “ Educación Básica y Media ”, which according to
Nicaraguan Law goes from preschool to upper secondary (grade 11). In the N icaraguan system, “ Educacion básica”
comprehends up to grade 9 (up to lower secondary) and “ Educación media ”, grades 10 and 11 (Upper secondary).
10 González, Carballo, Abea, Rivera y Madriz (2015) show that the difference between primary and secondary

spending is likely incorrectly estimated in the official budget. Between 2010 and 2013, the official figures for
personnel expenditure, in primary are between 5.8 and 6.1 times the corresponding figures for secondary. Since student
teacher ratios are similar at the two levels and teacher wages are also similar across the two levels, the authors argue
that personnel expenditure is likely not much higher than the difference in enrollments during the same period. Under
this assumption, in 2013, the share of primary spending would be approximately 37 percent, while secondary would

Between 2008 and 2013, the per student spending increased annually by 6.1 percent for
primary education, while spending was more stable for preschool and increased steadily for
secondary school (until 2013). Figure 16 shows that part of the reason for the increase in per
student sending in primary education has been the decrease in primary enrollment, which is partly
explained by the decline in the pre-school aged population, as well as the greater efficiency of the
overall system at this level. Meanwhile, Figure 17 shows that, between 2008 and 2013, per student
expenditure in preschool has been more or less stable, although it increased dramatically in 2014
(by 229 percent).12 Over the same period, per student expenditures in secondary education showed
a slight increase in 2009, followed by more steady increases through 2013 and then a larger 31


be approximately 13 percent and formal preschool 3 percent. In this case, the estimates for secondary education
spending would be more in line with the numbers of the whole CA region, alth ough both primary and secondary in
Nicaragua would still be at a disadvantage relatively to the spending in tertiary education. These are of course
inferences and all our analysis is, instead, based on the data analyzed and consolidated by ICEFI. Furthermo re, our
main recommendations of a spending is heavily biased towards tertiary education would remain unchanged.
11 In this report, expenditure with INATEC (public institute leading training and technical education) is accounted in

the spending for social protection and labor policies. This exercise is consistent with the accounting in other social
sector expenditure reviews for other countries of the Central America region. For the period 2010-2013, expenditure
by INATEC was estimated between 0.19 percent and 0.42 percent of GDP (MHCP, 2015).
12 This is largely the result of a greater investment in preschool infrastructure, textbooks and teacher training, partly

financed with World Bank support.

percent increase between 2013 and 2014. Overall, the 70.1 percent increase in per student
expenditure in secondary education between 2008 and 2014 shows an increasing policy priority
for investing in this level of education. The increase in expenditures at both preschool and
secondary levels is mostly explained by additional funds allocated for school infrastructure since
2014 (MINED, 2015).

As a percent of GDP, primary education spending is above the average of comparator
countries, however it is below the average for peer countries for per student spending
(Figures 18 and 19). The lower levels of per student spending in primary education reflects that
Nicaragua has more students in primary school compared to the total population than countries
with similar levels of GDP. This is not surprising, particularly given its relatively young
population.

In contrast, secondary education spending as percent of GDP is still quite low in comparis on
to other countries. Figures 20 and 21 show secondary education spending as percent of GDP and
per student spending for several countries. In both figures, it is clear that Nicaragua spends less on
secondary education than comparator countries. However, this gap is likely due to the fact that
expenditures on secondary education are likely under-estimated in official MINED data. Adjusted
figures would somewhat rebalance this spending, making it closer to 17 percent and placing
Nicaragua above the LAC average and well above spending levels seen in El Salvador, Panama
and Guatemala, although still below the adjusted linear regression line.

Tertiary education spending as percent of GDP is well above the average of peer countries ,
however gross enrollment in tertiary education in Nicaragua is lower than that of other
countries with similar income levels (Figures 22 and 23). This reflects Nicaragua’s sectoral bias
towards higher education, which benefits from a special provision in the National Constitutio n.
The Constitution stipulates that tertiary education spending for those universities that are a part of
the CNU should account for 6 percent of total government expenditures for education. 13




13There are also a large number of unregulated private institutio ns funded by tuition and fees. Section 1.4 includes a
more detailed institutional discussion of the sector.

As of 2013, personnel expenditures in basic education (from preschool to upper secondary)
represented 72 percent of MINED’s budget. While this share is in line with other countries (not
reported), there is anecdotal evidence that other personnel expenses (for teacher salaries) are
reported under a different category. This category represents approximately 5 percent of MINED’s
budget and includes: i) subsidies to private schools, which are used to pay teacher salaries; and, ii)
community teachers in charge of community preschools who are not formally recognized as
MINED staff. It is unclear how this would affect the overall share of the budget going to personnel
expenditures and whether it would place estimates substantially above the previously cited 72
percent.

Teacher pay in Nicaragua does not seem to be competitive and tends to be less dispersed
relative to other professions in the country. Figure 24 shows that total monthly wages for
teachers in Nicaragua are lower than for other professions by an average of 23 percent for 2014.
However, hourly wages are almost in line with earnings of other professions (there is a 2 percent
hourly wage premium).14 Figure 25 shows that teachers’ earnings vary less (smaller dispersion)
than wages in other professions, suggesting that there are fewer incentives for high performance.
This could potentially discourage skilled teachers who would benefit from more competitive pay
schemes.


14 This figure, however, should be cautiously interpreted as the total hours of work de facto worked by teachers may
differ from the ones reported in the survey data which simply capture the hours at school.

On average, Nicaragua has a higher student to teacher ratio than other countries with similar
income levels (including Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador), but as the school-age
populations are beginning to shrink, student to teacher ratios will likely decrease, with all
else staying constant. Figures 26 and 27 report the student to teacher ratios for primary and
secondary education in Nicaragua and other countries. Both figures show that most Central
American countries tend to have lower student to teacher ratios than Nicaragua for both primary
and secondary school. Moving forward, there is pressure for further reductions in student to teacher
ratios. Since 2005, the school aged population has been steadily declining and population
projections in Figure 28 show that this is likely to continue in the future. 15 For example, between
2005 and 2020, the number of individuals aged 0-19 years old will decline by 99,051 (3.7 percent)
and the share of this population group will decline from 45.2 percent to 39.6 percent. Furthermore,
in 2050, this age group will have declined even further, by an additional 484,368 (18.8 percent),
leaving this population’s share of the total population at 26.4 percent. 16 This decline presents an

16 Nevertheless, doubts remain on the exact figure of the school age population’s decline, since the precision of 2005

Census figures has been questioned and the new Census is overdue. With regard to the population aged 5-19, the
decrease between 2005 and 2020 will be 77,098 or -3.8 percent, or a 4.3 points decline in their share of the population
(INIDE, 2015).

opportunity to focus education spending on policies and programs that sustain learning. 17 Even
though the country faces important challenges on the infrastructure side, recent evidence (e.g.,
Glewwe and Muralidharan, 2016) supports the view that many expensive “standard” school input
policies are often not very effective in improving outcomes, though some specific inputs (which
are often less expensive) are. For example, interventions that focus on improved pedagogy,
especially supplemental instruction to children lagging behind grade level competencies, are
particularly effective, as are interventions that improve school governance and teacher
accountability. These types of interventions could be important areas for Nicaragua to focus on in
order to increase the cost-effectiveness of public spending in education.

IV.2      Education Outcomes and Challenges

Coverage is already almost universal in primary education and is slightly increasing at the
secondary level, but overall it is still low by international standards. Figure 29 shows that there
has been a decline in gross enrollment of 6 percentage points between 2008 (117 percent) and 2013
(111 percent) in primary education. Together with an almost stable net enrollment in primary
education until 2012 (Figure 30), this suggests an increasing efficiency in primary education
system. However, between 2008 and 2013, the three percent decline in net enrollment in primary
education, from 92 percent to 89 percent, may be a matter of concern. 18 Between 2008 and 2013,
the trend in gross and net secondary enrollment was more positive than in primary enrollme nt,
with an increase of 5 percent and 6 percent in gross and net enrollment rates, respectively. This
implies that the expansion of secondary school enrollment is mainly due to the increased number
of adolescents in the proper age range for attending this level of education. In fact, the number of

Primary net enrollment and secondary gross enrollment are in line with other countries with
similar GDP per capita. However, net enrollment in secondary school is well below the average
for similar countries in Central America. Figures 31 and 32 report the net enrollment rates in
several countries (circa 2012), while Figure 33 shows an international comparison of secondary
gross enrollment, against country GDP. According to these figures, gross secondary enrollment in
Nicaragua tends to be in line with the one for countries with similar income levels, similar to other
Central American countries (such as El Salvador, Panama, and Guatemala). However, net
enrollment in secondary education is below selected Central American countries and the average
for the LAC region. This difference suggests that despite having a similar coverage level, there is
still a high level over age students in the system, meaning that many secondary school aged
children (11 to 16) are currently enrolled in primary education (as detailed below in section 1.2.).

increased from 73.6 percent in 2008 to 76.1 percent in 2013, and 81.8 percent in 2015. The share of adolescents that
remained in primary has declined from representing 64 percent of adolescents in the school system in 2008 to 49
percent in 2013. The latter is a clear illustration of the progress in the efficiency of the education system.

Despite the fact that there are two tracks for upper secondary education, technical and
vocational education are limited. Almost all enrollment follows the main academic, or general
track (secundaria diversificada), which typically prepares students for university. As Figure 34
shows, only 4 percent of all upper secondary students nationwide actually enroll in technical
education (bachillerato tecnico). Moreover, as shown in Figure 35, the biggest share of enrollme nt
at the upper secondary level in technical and vocational education is in public institutions (MINED,

students are likely a challenge.

Enrollment falls quickly starting around age 11, the appropriate age for completing primary
school, while the decline is particularly steep around age 14, the appropriate age for
beginning upper secondary school. Figure 36 shows the percentage of children enrolled in school
by age across Central America, including contrasting data for Nicaragua between 2009 and 2014.
This data shows a large increase in school enrollment in Nicaragua, especially for children 5-6
years old and adolescents 13-17 years old between 2009 and 2014. In 2014, Nicaragua showed a
sharp decline in school enrollment starting at age 14, which is accentuated in older age groups.
Enrollments for ideal ages of basic education students are still 2 to 5 points below those already
achieved by El Salvador. The gap between Nicaragua and Costa Rica is also significant, reaching
between 5 and 9 points for ideal ages of basic education, increasing at age 14 to 11 points, and
further accelerating at age 15 when it reaches 23 points and remains stable thereafter.




20 According to INATEC statistics, there are circa 3,500 students participating in technical education modalities similar
to Bachillerato Tecnico , but this could not be confirmed trough available official education statistics.

Despite improvements in the attainment of basic education, primary and secondary (lowe r
and upper) completion remain quite low in Nicaragua. Figure 37 and 38 show the evolution of
primary and secondary (lower and upper) attainment for different age groups using household
surveys from 2005 and 2014.21 Some facts are worth noting: (i) the sustained increase in attainme nt
between the consecutive age groups shows Nicaragua’s efforts over the last half century to promote
more schooling across generations; and (ii) there were significant improvements in graduation
rates from the regular system for all age groups (and especially for the younger cohorts) between
2005 and 2014. The only exception is the dramatic improvement in completion of primary
education for the 55-64 age group. Furthermore, the data shows that in spite of the progress, today
there are still important completion gaps: (i) completion of primary education is well below 100
percent even for the youngest cohorts, and today 1 out of 4 young people have not completed six
grades of primary education; and (ii) completion of secondary school is still extremely low, as
only 2 out of 5 people aged 20-24 years old completed this level. Finally, it is worth noting that
the significant increase in the completion of primary and secondary education may also partly

Since 2008, the internal efficiency of Nicaragua’s basic education system has been steadily
improving. A closer look at the various indicators of internal efficiency of the basic education
system illustrates this improvement. Figures 39, 40 and 41 show the retention, repetition and
survival rates for the basic education system between 2008 and 2013. 24 This data shows that
retention rates increased by 3.2 percent at the primary level and 1.9 percent at secondary level,
while repetition rates declined from 11.1 percent to 6.3 percent in primary school and from 7.9
percent to 5.1 percent in secondary school. Similarly, survival rates have increased for each grade,
but are especially high for sixth grade. In 2013, the probability of finishing sixth grade once

22 Other options are migration and measurement error.
23 Some well-known programs include for primary education: “Alfabetización, Nivelación”, “Ya Puedo Leer y
Escribir” y “Yo Si Puedo Seguir”. For secondary, there is also “secundaria nocturna”, “bachillerato por madurez, II
ciclo, Sandino II y Secundaria a Distancia. Consistent with the success of these programs the illiteracy rate changed
from 20.5 percent in 2005 to 14.6 percent in 2014.
24 Retention rate (or intra annual retention) is defined as the relation between the number of students enrolled at the

beginning of the school year and number of students enrolled at the end of the school year in the same grade. Repetition
rate is the relation between the number of repeaters in the school year (t+1) and the number of students enrolled in a
school year (t). Survival rate is the percentage of a cohort of students who enter the first grade of primary education
and who are expected to reach the last grade, regardless of repetition (UNESCO, 2005).

enrolled in first grade reached 63 percent, up from 53 percent in 2008. This is a sharp boost over
a short period of time. The sustained improvement of internal efficiency indicators, coupled with
selected new policies to reinforce this positive trend, are likely to continue to deliver results in the
coming years.

Several programs and policies have likely contributed to these efficiency improvements, and
those focused on the delivery of school kits and school meals may have had some impact.
Although increasing evidence suggests that traditional supply-side programs are not cost-effective
in improving learning in low income settings (Gluwwe and Muralidharan, 2016), some anecdotal
evidence suggests that, in Nicaragua, school kits and school meals have increased the incentives
of parents to send children to school and have contributed to improved performance. The rationale
is that healthier and better equipped/dressed children are more “ready” and likely to learn in school,
and hence, such interventions could lower repetition and increase survival rates throughout the
system. The evidence presented in Figures 42 and 43 shows that the programs have been mainly
targeted to the poorest and, as of 2014, have reached important program coverage (see Barahona
et al, 2014).25 Even though a rigorous impact evaluation has not been undertaken for these
interventions, anecdotal evidence suggest that these two programs may have contributed to
improving the internal efficiency of the education system, especially among the poorest. 26

School dropout rates in primary and secondary school are strongly correlated with a
student’s lack of interest, as well as with the distance to the school. Figure 44 shows the main
reasons for dropping out of formal school for children 6-12 years and 13-18 years old. This data
suggests that school dropouts for those up to 12 years old is related to both demand and supply-

25 These are the two main social programs for education sector. For more information, please see Barahona et al
(2013).
26 Even though there is no impact evaluation anecdotal evidence suggests significant impacts of these programs among

the poorest families of Nicaragua especially because they reduce the cost of attending school as parents to not get
enough financial resources to buy them clothes, shoes and educational materials.

side challenges. For example, remoteness of the school is an important factor for non-attendance
for 19 percent of younger students. For the older cohort, the main reason for not attending is
skewed more towards demand-side factors, including a lack of interest (43 percent) and financ ia l
or economic difficulties (16 percent), and the need to work (mainly outside the house for males
and in household tasks for women).

High desertion rates from secondary school are also likely driven by the stigma associated
with being an over age student, which accumulates from the early grades of primary through
grade repetition. Figure 45 shows that, in 2014, Nicaragua had the largest rate of over age students
in Central America.27 As of 2014, 24 percent of the primary students in Nicaragua were over age,
compared to 18.2 percent for El Salvador. Figure 46 unpacks this over age phenomena across
primary grades and shows that the share of over age children in Nicaragua declines across grades,
being highest for the first grade. Between 2008 and 2013, the average repetition and dropout rates
also fall across grades (not reported). On average, repetition and dropouts rates for first grade are
15 percent and 16 percent, respectively. These averages decline steadily in out years, with
repetition rates falling to 10 percent in second grade and 2 percent in sixth grade, while dropouts
decline form 9 percent in second grade to 5 percent in sixth grade (MINED, 2016).28

old.

To date, Government policies have mostly tackled supply-side challenges to dropouts in
order to facilitate access, enrollment, and retention. The main policy actions that have been
taken include: (i) allocating the best primary teachers to first grade, where the largest dropout and
repetition rates are still observed; and, (ii) eliminating repetition in first and second grades. Box 3
discusses this policy strategy, entitled Estrategia del Primer y Segundo Grado . In addition,
promoting the completion of fifth and sixth grade in multi-grade schools (Box 5) and supporting
the implementation of a new alternative for secondary schools in rural areas (Box 6) are also
critical aspects of the Government’s policy efforts.

                                    Box 3: Nicaragua learning Strategy with emphasis on
                                    Childhood Development in the first and second grades
 Enrollment statistics for first and second grades reveal that a high percentage of first grade students do
 not pass on to second grade. For instance, between 1999 and 2012, approximately 26 percent of children
 enrolled in these grades did not pass to the next grade (MINED, 2016). This fact has been identified as a
 policy priority at MINED. Today, the Government is eager to improve repetition and incentivize students
 to complete primary school.

 In order to broadly tackle the issue of primary school desertion and specifically improve the repetition
 and retention in first and second grades, the Government began implementing a new strategy, entitled
 Learning Strategy with Emphasis on Childhood Development in First and Second Grades , in 2015.




                                                                          48

 The main objectives of this strategy are to reduce first and second grade dropout through: i) leading a
 curriculum reform and designing and printing new textbooks for students and teachers (based on the new
 curriculum) for both grades; ii) assessing and revising the current distribution of multi-grade classes at
 the national level to increase the number of first grade classes that are not shared with other grades and
 limiting the combination of students from first through third grades for those classes that remain multi-
 grade; iii) revising the teacher selection process to ensure, particularly for first grade, that those chosen
 have strong teaching aptitudes; iv) strengthening teacher training through the reform and standardization
 of teaching methods nationwide, with a strong emphasis on the synthetic analytic phonics instruction for
 reading skills; and, v) introducing new learning assessments.

 Evidence suggests that important advancements have been made on all of these fronts, especially in the
 training of teachers, creation of new curriculum, and distribution of new textbooks.

 de Educación Primaria." MINED, August 2014.


Moving forward, more attention could be given to implementing more comprehensive
strategies, including both demand and supply-side policies to reduce dropouts. Furthermore,
strengthening vocational alternatives in upper secondary education and labor market relevance of
lower secondary might also be considered. In recognition of the fact that several reasons for
desertion are demand-side driven, it would be important for policies to foster more cost-effective
demand-side policies moving forward, such as increasing the immediate returns of schooling or
the student’s effort. In addition, it could also be valuable to consid er other supply-side policies to
complement demand-side efforts (see Glewwe and Muralidharan, 2016). From the interventio ns
discussed and recommended by Almeida, Fitzsimons and Rogers (2015) for the LAC region, it is
likely that a combination of improved school governance, greater teacher accountability,
community involvement, and interventions focused on improved pedagogies (supplemented by a
relevant and attractive curriculum at secondary level) could be a promising route for Nicaragua,
both to reduce dropouts as well as to improve pertinence and quality. 29 The possibility of installing
early warning systems, with different pedagogical, socioeconomic, and psychological supports
depending on the diagnosis, are being also considered in Nicaragua. Regardless of the
interventions, it would be important for the Government to be willing to test the impact of more
diverse and comprehensive packages of reforms that simultaneously address supply and demand-
side challenges.

In sum, although Nicaragua’s overall level educational attainment is improving quickly, it is
still low in comparison to other countries in Central America and has resulted in generating
a labor force that remains highly unskilled. Figure 47 shows that Nicaragua’s five year
attainment rates for individuals aged 15-19 years old have increased by 5 percent between 2009

29 Evidence suggests that school-based management appears to reduce dropout in lower secondary, whether because
of better monitoring of performance by parents improves quality or because greater involvement spurs more household
support for staying in school.

and 2014 (EMNV, 2009 and 2014). Similarly, the improvement for 6 and 7 year attainment rates
is above 7 percent, while for 8 and 9 years of attainment there is an increase of over 8.5 percent.
However, in comparison to Central America, Nicaragua’s completion rates are still low, lagging
behind El Salvador and even slightly behind Honduras for the primary level. While attainment of
up to 4 years of schooling for those aged 15-19 years old is quite high, there is a steady decline in
for additional years of schooling. On average, only 41 percent of this age cohort actually completes
the full basic education, or a total of 9 years of education. This pattern still implies ample potential
demand for adult education among the youth. Even though the trends are moving in the right
direction, progress is slow and it will take time to translate policy changes into real and significa nt
improvements in the education of the workforce. Figure 48 shows that the education level of the
Nicaraguan labor force remains low in comparison to other countries, below the averages for both
El Salvador and Central America as a whole, but above Honduras and Guatemala.

Regarding learning outcomes, Nicaragua has one of the lowest regional results in LAC,
though it is slowly improving.30 Figure 49 reports the results of the Second Regional Comparative
and Explanatory Study (SERCE) and TERCE for various LAC countries. It shows that TERCE
results on student learning in Nicaragua are below those for students in Honduras and Guatemala.
However, it is also true that these countries have a smaller fraction of the population attending the
sixth grade, so there could be a positive bias in student quality. Finally, the results on learning for
Nicaragua are above those in Panama, Paraguay and Dominican Republic. This trend of a general,
but rather small improvement in student learning during the period is confirmed by the trend in
national student assessments for fourth, sixth, and ninth grades ( Evaluacion Nacional del
Aprendizaje de los Estudiantes, 2009-2010). This is most likely driven by the fact that most of the
education policies in recent years have included a stronger focus on access and completion of

assesses the performance of students in third and sixth grades primary school in Mathematics, Reading and Writing
(Language), plus Natural Sciences in the case of sixth grade. The main objective of TERCE is to measure the quality
of education in the region and orient decision-making in education policy. SERCE was collected in 2006.

In Nicaragua, primary school public expenditure is fairly progressive, while public tertiary
education expenditure is highly regressive. Figure 50 shows the incidence of public education
spending in Nicaragua by consumption quintile. According to this data, while the first quintile
receives 3 times the spending on primary education of the fifth quintile, the fifth quintile receives
5 times more than the first quintile on tertiary education resources. In addition, secondary
education expenditure is moderately progressive. Overall, total education expenditure is more or
less neutral from the distributional point of view, with all income quintiles receiving similar
amounts, with only a mild advantage in the fifth quintile over the first. This pattern is mostly
attributable to the number of children in each quintile (which favors the progressiveness of
spending in primary and secondary) and the inequities in access (which creates a regressive
spending pattern in secondary and, especially, tertiary education).

Most students enrolled in basic education are in public schools, while only 9 percent attend
private schools and 7 percent attend private subsidized schools. As illustrated in Figure 51, as
of 2014, almost 85 percent of the students enrolled in first through eleventh grades nationwide
were enrolled in public institutions, with another 7 percent in schools that received a public subsidy
for teacher salaries. In rural areas, the share of public primary education enrollment is 94 percent
(not reported) (MINED, 2016).

There are large gaps in access to secondary and post-secondary education across income
groups. Figure 52 presents net enrollment rates by income quintiles. It is interesting to note that
most quintiles have reached nearly 90 percent net enrollment in primary school. This is true except
for the first quintile, in which more than 20 percent of children are out of school. This non-
participation rate is approximately the same as on the Caribbean Coast. The enrollment gap widens
at the secondary level, with net enrollment of the richest quintile at 154 percent above the poorest,
and with large differences between all quintiles. It is worth noting that the low 31.5 percent net
enrollment rate of the first quintile in secondary does not mean that the rest are out of school. In
fact, 33.5 percent are still in primary, and 35 percent have dropped out. Gaps rise considerably in
post-secondary, with 39.3 percent of the richest quintile participating in higher education,
compared to just 2.9 percent of the poorest quintile. A very small proportion of children and youth
from the first three quintiles attain post-secondary education, demonstrating the highly regressive
nature of Government subsidies at this level of education.

In rural areas, entrance to the education system is later and access to secondary education is
lower than in urban areas. Figure 53 reports the level of participation across age ranges for both
rural and urban populations. This data shows that enrollment rates across all levels of education
are higher for urban populations than those living in rural areas. It also shows that the enrollme nt
gaps across urban and rural areas is more pronounced for higher education levels, such as
secondary and post-secondary education. The smallest rural enrollment gap is seen between the
ages 9 and 11. While the difference in enrollment between 5 and 8 years old is likely a reflectio n
of poor rural households delaying entrance to school, the difference from 12 years of age onwards

reflects higher dropout rates, likely due to failure to progress through the educational system and
a result of restricted access to secondary education opportunities. Slightly less than half of rural
adolescents aged 15-17 years old have abandoned their education.

Access to education is particularly low on the Caribbean Coast, where Afro-descendants and
indigenous communities live. Figure 54 shows that net enrollment is lower on the Caribbean
Coast for all age groups, and with a considerably low proportion of students aged 5 to 8 years of
age participating in the system. Late entrance to the education system is related to both cultura l
aspects (i.e. lack of interest in preschool education by the indigenous and rural communities) and
low preschool supply (MINED, 2016). In addition, high dropouts are related to geographical and
climate obstacles that exist in isolated communities with extremely low accessibility during the
winter/rainy season.

Most children living in rural areas attend community preschools where learning conditions
tend to be of lower quality than public schools. In Nicaragua, there are two main types of
preschools: i) formal preschools, led by a teacher hired by MINED and functioning in public
buildings (generally primary schools); and, ii) community preschools, led by teachers catalogued
as “volunteers” (educadoras comunitarias), who receive a small payment from the state (aporte
voluntario). The educadoras comunitarias are, in most cases, young girls from the communities
who work as volunteers, but lack formal pedagogical training and who may not even have
completed their secondary education. As of 2009, most children living in rural areas attended
community preschools (Figure 55). In general, these community preschools neither adhere to
quality standards, nor are they formal supervised by MINED. They function on private properties,
usually from religious organizations, or in unused houses borrowed by community members with
minimal security standards. School furniture tends to be provided by community members and
learning materials are not systematically provided by State. 31 Figure shows the difference in the
average monthly salary of a formal basic education teacher and the earnings of community
preschool teachers.32




31 Currently, MINED is providing learning materials packages to all preschools nationwide containing i) small school
supplies (e.g., pencils, water color paints, scissors, markers, notebooks); and ii) educational materials (abacus,
geometric shapes, numbers; dominos, puzzles, plastic balls, cloth dolls, storybooks, musical instruments, etc.).
However, this is financed with external funds and will be discontinued in 2017.
32 In the national education budget preschool teachers wages in community schools is not considered a wages, but

rather “aid”.

The new Quality Model for Preschool Education is a recent policy effort to improve access
to and quality of preschools. Since 2011, with the launch of the Education Sector Strategy Plan
2011-2015 (MINED, 2012), the Government started an important effort to increase access to
formal schools in rural areas, with new preschool classrooms in rural primary public schools.
Additionally, it also launched the Quality Model for Preschool Education, which is anchored in
two important principals (Box 4). First, it is aimed at setting the same quality standards for both
formal and community preschools. Second, it follows a strong community-centric approach,
involving parents and local authorities in preschool activities, such as the preparation of school
meals.

                   Box 4: Quality Model for Preschool Education (Modelo de Calidad para Preescolar)
 In order to improve preschool quality, the Government has been implementing a new quality model for
 preschool education since 2013. Today, the model includes several dimensions, including: i)
 development, design and implementation of new curriculum and learning instruments for pre-school; ii)
 promotion and incentivizing teacher participation in pre-service training to obtain a teacher certificate;
 iii) development and piloting of new quality standards for preschool infrastructure; iv) delivery of
 learning materials to preschools nationwide (puzzles, musical instruments, small supplies, etc.); and iv)
 development of an early childhood development (ECD) monitoring and evaluation system. To-date, over
 20 percent of the non-graduated community teachers have already participated in pre-service training
 and now hold a teacher certificate.

 Although this new quality model has been an important milestone in the Nicaraguan education sector,
 the implementation of this new model is still incipient. Furthermore, its expansion presents important
 challenges. First, it is important to consolidate the legal and institutional framework, as well as the funds

 (mainly for scholarships) for both pre-service and in-service teacher training, especially for community
 teachers (educadoras comunitarias ). Second, it is important to obtain sufficient national financing for
 preschool infrastructure, as well as the requisite learning materials. Finally, there are multiple challenges
 related to the adaptation of this model on the Caribbean Coast, including cultural and institutional
 specificities, such as learning materials prepared in the native languages.

Over age students in primary education are predominantly those from the poorest quintile s
and are disproportionally male and from rural areas. Figure 57 reports the share of children
enrolled in primary education that are over age for the adequate grade. It shows, for instance, that
67 percent of the boys in primary school are over aged, while girls reach 59 percent. Furthermore,
approximately 71 percent of the children enrolled in rural areas are over age, compared to 56
percent in urban areas. It is interesting to note that 45 percent of the children from the upper income
quintile are also over age, which is almost half of the share of over age students in the poorest
quintile (71 percent). Within the poorest quintile, approximately 4 out of every 5 children lag
behind in primary school.

In rural areas, most primary schools are multi-grade schools, which poses a challenge for
improving learning and education quality. Multi-grade primary schools function in rural or
semirural areas, combining more than one grade under the same teacher. These schools currently
represent 70 percent of schools nationwide and account for 33 percent of national primary
enrollment (MINED, 2016). Thus, they and are an important component of the Nicaraguan basic

education system. As discussed in Box 5, multi-grade schools are a priority for the Governme nt
and will be at the center of the new education sector strategy for 2016-2021.

                         Box 5: Multi-grade and “Incomplete” Primary Schools
 Multi-grade schools were mainly present in rural areas due to the dispersion of the population, the lack
 of teachers and/or the lack of infrastructure. In multi-grade schools two or more grades are assigned to
 only one teacher. These schools present challenging conditions for teacher and students (i.e. a small
 classroom for many students learning different contents at the same time.). Additionally, multi-grade
 schools favors the existence of what are called “incomplete schools,” which only offer first throu gh third
 grade, third to fifth grade, or fourth to sixth grades. Despite being a solution for very small communities,
 this division creates challenges to continuity of learning and results in higher levels of dropouts,
 especially when the schools are far away from each other (i.e. a student finishes first grade and has to
 move to another community school to attend third grade).

 Since 2012, under the new Education Sector Strategy 2011-2015, the Government has supported
 improving the quality of the multi-grade schools through setting quality standards, strengthening teacher
 training, and investing in school infrastructure. To date, a number of improvements have been made,
 including: (i) implementation of a pre-service teacher training program that offers scholarships for those
 students willing to teach in their communities of origin; (ii) setting new quality standards, regarding the
 exact school grades that can be combined in multi-grade schools.

In rural areas, demand for secondary education is growing and will be a critical gap to be
filled in the years ahead. With the improvements in access to and efficiency of primary education
in recent years, pressure is growing for increased access to lower secondary education, especially
in rural areas. Figure 58 shows the increased enrollment for secondary education between 2009
and 2014 across urban and rural areas. While overall enrollment is higher in urban areas, rural
areas have seen a faster improvement in, particularly for students aged 13 to 17 (upper secondary).
In order to improve the gains in lower secondary enrollment, the Government has been
implementing the Secundaria a Distancia en el Campo initiative since 2014, which is targeted at
increasing access to lower secondary education for rural populations (Box 6).

                           Box 6: Program Secundaria a Distancia in rural areas
 Secundaria a Distancia en el Campo is a national program that has been under implemented since 2014
 and which is focused on increasing access to lower secondary education (grades 7 through 9) in rural
 areas. It was designed as a weekend educational option for students from isolated rural areas who have
 completed primary but do not have a secondary school in their community. It included the designation
 of new secondary teachers, an adapted curriculum and learning materials, and new school infrastructure
 (basically, a new classroom in existing primary schools). To date, about 400 new secondary classrooms
 have been completed for seventh and eighth grades. Through this modality, an increase in lower
 secondary enrollment and completion rates in rural areas is expected. However, quality seems to be an
 issue due to the reduced number of hours in the classroom and the lack of a clear curricular framework.
 A deeper analysis is needed to better assess the success of this approach.

The level of enrollment and participation of females and males does not differ significantly
in Nicaragua. Figure 59 reports the share of enrollment for ages 5-20 by gender, computed using
national surveys (EMNV, 2014). The results show that, across all ages, enrollment for both genders
are reasonably close. There are some exceptions at various age intervals (ages 6, 8-9 and 19-20),
where female enrollment is higher by around 7 percentage points. Conversely, around age 13,
enrollments for males are higher. When looking at the reasons for dropping out of school, there
are some differences across genders (not reported). For example, females tend to be more affected
by the remoteness of schools, as it is related to higher levels of criminal and sexual violence.

Education expenditure represents a similar proportion of household income in each quintile
in secondary (4 percent) and post-secondary (8 percent) education, but is lower for low
income households at the primary level (Figure 60). More importantly, as a proportion of their
income, poor households spend much less on primary schooling than households in the wealthiest
quintile. However, expenditures for secondary schooling are comparable across quintiles, probably
as a consequence of a large portion of students from higher income quintiles attending private
schools.

Despite being behind several LAC peers in learning outcomes, the correlation across learning
and income groups is the lowest in Nicaragua than in several other LAC countries. Figure 61
depicts the relationship between TERCE reading scores and income quintiles across LAC. While
learning outcomes for the first decile are similar to or higher than other Central American countries
(except Costa Rica), in higher income deciles, the other countries generally tend to improve faster
than Nicaragua. As a consequence, Nicaragua has relatively low results and a more equal
distribution of reading scores across income deciles than other countries in the LAC region.

Similarly, the gap in learning results between private and public schools is small and becomes
almost negligible between urban and rural public schools. While, on average, learning results
in private urban schools are better than those in public urban schools, the difference is not
significant and may reflect mostly socioeconomic differences (Figure 62). More importantly, the
differences in educational attainment between public rural and urban schools is negligib le.
Furthermore, girls in Nicaragua perform better in language, while boys perform better in math, but
the difference is stronger and more significant in the former (Figures 63 and 64).

There are also large disparities in learning outcomes across geographic regions of the
country. Congruent with the low results in SERCE and TERCE, performance at an advanced or
excellent level was reached by only 10 percent of students in only 4 out of 17 Departments. Figure
65 highlights this difference in performance across regions, with lower results in Madriz, the North
Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (Región Autonoma de la Costa Caribe Norte, RACCN), and
Jinotega. In these regions, at least 2 out 3 children are below a basic level of performance,
compared to only 2 out of 5 children in Managua and Rivas. Still, the later proportion is high, and
a matter of concern. Two other departments, Carazo and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous

Region (Región Autonoma de la Costa Caribe Sur, RACCS), report only 1 out of 20 children
performing below a basic level, while the rest almost do not have students attaining that level.
Unfortunately, National tests are only available for 2009 and 2010, meaning that geographica l
differences in results cannot be traced further back (a test was performed in 2015, but results are
not yet available).

IV. 3 Institutional Arrangements

The General Law of Education (2006) and its subsequent reforms establish the general
guidelines of the educational system in Nicaragua (Table 3).33 The education system is
composed of five sub-systems: i) Basic and Secondary Education and teacher preparation; ii)
Technical and Vocational Education and Training; iii) Higher Education; iv) Autonomous
Regional Education Subsystem of the Caribbean Coast (Subsistema de Educación Autonómica
Regional, SEAR); and, v) Out-of-school Education. The basic and secondary education sub-
systems is the largest sub-system and is administered by MINED. Box 7 briefly describes the main
features of the National Education System in Nicaragua. 34 The Law mandates that the public
system is free at all levels, but mandatory only at the primary level. The sub-system also includes

governance arrangements in the education sector in Nicaragua. See Blackwell (2014).
34 “Educación Básica y Media”, according to Nicaraguan Law, goes from preschool to upper secondary (grade 11). In

the Nicaraguan system, “Educacion básica” comprehends up to grade 9 (up to lower sec ondary) and “Educación
media”, grades 10 and 11 (Upper secondary).

various modalities for adult education, including literacy programs, part-time and distance primary
schooling, and accelerated basic secondary schooling.

The legal framework and institutional leadership of the education system is still fragmente d
with a disperse set of regulatory frameworks and actors. The legal framework of the education
sector is composed of more than 40 different legal instruments, which are relevant for differe nt
sub-systems. Often the different sub-systems change and are rearranged as they become politica l
priorities of different governments. The various education sector laws have established seven
different institutions as governing bodies of the different sub-systems, including: (i) MINED; (ii)
INATEC; (iii) the CNU; (iv) the National Council of University Presidents; (v) the RACCS and
the RACCN. The sub-system of technical and vocational education and training is managed by
INATEC and is primarily financed by a 2 percent payroll levy (in the formal economy). The sub-
system of higher education, managed by the CNU, is composed of five public national universities,
which offer tuition free of charge, and 68 private institutions. The sub-system of out-of-school
education is officially part of the sector, but has no concrete institutional expression or governance
structure. All of these institutions have their own interests and their own unique bureaucratic
structure.

                                 Box 7: Education and the National Law
 Education is a constitutional right in Nicaragua. The Constitution affirms that all Nicaraguans have a
 right to education and culture, which is to be provided free of charge by the State. Access to education
 should be equal for all Nicaraguans, and indigenous peoples and other ethnic communities have a right
 to learn in their native language.

 The Constitution also includes special provisions to ensure autonomy and state funding for higher
 education. For example, it states that universities and centers of higher technical education enjoy




                                                     65
                      Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


 administrative, organic, financial and academic autonomy. These institutions are, by law, to be financed
 by the State through annual contributions equivalent to 6 percent of the national budget.

 The political division of the country includes two geographically large, but sparsely populated
 autonomous regions bordering the Caribbean Coast, the RACCN and the RACCS. These areas are largely
 inhabited by indigenous and afro descent populations,35 containing 5 distinct indigenous and afro-
 descendent communities (Creole, Miskito, Sumus, Mayagna and Garifuna). These communities each
 have native languages other than Spanish.

In this context of institutional dispersion, historical efforts to articulate the education sector
sub-systems have not been successful. While the General Law of Education was approved in
2006, it has not truly been implemented since January 2007, when the Sandinista Government took
power. For example, article 56 of the Law established the National Council of Education as the
superior body of Education system.36 However, the Council never become operative. Additionally,
the National Human Development Plan 2010-2014, declared an intention to articulate the key sub-
systems, and various structures had been created to foster dialogue among these sub-systems.
However, progress has been very slow, especially with regard to system-wide strategic planning.

In the last two years, a number of ad hoc initiatives have achieved been successful in fostering
inter-institutional collaboration on selected activities. For example, MINED and INATEC are
collaborating to provide technical training in agriculture, while INATEC and CNU are working to
identify instructor training needs and to make it possible for graduates of technical programs at the
secondary level to enroll in university programs. Finally, MINED and CNU are working to
diagnose and improve normal school performance. Despite generally centralized decision-mak ing
(within the Office of the Presidency), the Government seems to be unwilling to impose structural
change in the sector’s institutional framework.

The lack of solid legal framework and clear leadership, and the continued internal
contradictions between centralized management and dispersed institutional authority have
weakened the Government’s ability to address major challenges in the education sector. In
the basic and secondary sub-system, MINED combines managerial centralization with an effort to
engage local stakeholders in program delivery and, to a lesser extent, program planning and
monitoring. Almost all purchases and hiring take place at the central level, with less than 2 percent
of the sub- system budget managed by the Ministry’s departmental and municipal field offices. At
the same time, education councils have been established at the municipal level, munic ipa l
governments are encouraged to assist in infrastructure maintenance, and local parent and citizen

of the national one. Censo Nacional INIDE, 2005.
36 Article 58 defines the Council’s Executive Committee as the President of the Republic, the highest authorities of

the educational sub-systems, representatives of the National Assembly and the Autonomous Regional Councils, and
representatives of teachers and private universities.

groups collaborate on a number of activities. 37 In addition, members of the youth movement of the
Sandinista party take part in literacy and post-literacy programs.38 Moving forward, the
Government is considering expanding citizen engagement to include the local identification of
specific educational needs and the contextualization of the curriculum. Despite their legal
empowerment, autonomous governments in charge of the SEAR do not have the resources to carry
out their formal duties. Currently, the SEAR is under the responsibility of the Regional Education
Secretariats of the RACCN and the RACCS. However, due to lack of human and financ ia l
resources, MINED is in a de facto leadership position in these regions. The role of these regional
Secretariats is limited to the curricular development and management of parts of the basic and
secondary sub-systems in their respective territories.

Education for work at upper secondary and post-secondary levels is characterized by
fragmentation of providers, with limited coordination, teachers with reduced practical
experience and a curriculum that is irrelevant and/or disconnected from market needs .
Fourteen public institutions and dozens of private organizations are engaged in the delivery of
some aspect of vocational training and professional education, without an existing national policy
or regulatory framework to guide them (see Blackwell, 2014). There is also no coordinated
planning between the basic and secondary sub-system and the vocational training and professiona l
education system and there is a lack of clarity and consistency regarding alternative ways to
integrate and further harmonize the educational programs in one sub-system to another. Finally,
the curriculum of most vocational training and professional education courses is of only limited
relevance and is disconnected from the needs of the labor market. Blackwell (2014) highlights that
this is partially a result of the low number and low quality of vocational training and professiona l
education teachers.

Even though teacher policy remains a top priority for reform, there is a lack of clear vision
for reform and institutional leadership. The Government has identified education quality as the
overall sector priority, with improving teacher quality is at the center. Table 4 summarizes the
main institutional actors and characteristics for the pre-service and in-service teacher training in
Nicaragua today. In 2015, a joint CNU–MINED commission was been established to carry out a
national assessment of the quality of teacher training. The objective of this commission was to
identify the main curricular, administrative and financial challenges faced by the Teacher Training
schools (escuelas normales). These schools tend to be over-crowded with a large number of pre-
service and professional training activities for preschool and primary teachers. However, a national
teacher quality model to ensure recruitment of quality candidates and preparation and support of
strong teachers is still missing (for a discussion see Bruns et al, 2015).



37 These activities include the preparation of lunch in school or contacting parents of truant students before they
become system dropouts.
38 Examples include verifying enrollment data, and volunteering for teaching posts in isolated multi-grade classrooms.

Basic education teachers still lack solid pre-service education. For preschool, this is related to
the lack of an initial training system, the high cost of participation, and reduced financ ia l
incentives. Figure 66 shows that there is still quite a high level of both preschool (70 percent) and
secondary school teachers (42 percent) that have not formally graduated from any higher education
course (MINED, 2016). Furthermore, MINED had only developed a national curriculum for
preschool teacher training in 2015. Since then, there has been an intense nationwide campaign to
support teachers in acquiring additional skills. However, many preschool community teachers, do
not comply with the minimum educational requisites for receiving this “initial” training (70

percent). In addition, the costs of pre-service training (e.g., transport, allowance) are rather high
when compared to the relatively low compensation of community teachers.

Up-take of pre-service training for secondary teachers is also an issue, mainly due to the high
direct costs of training and the lack of financial incentives. Currently, 58 percent of secondary
school teachers lack a degree in education, though many are university graduates in other
disciplines (MINED, 2016). Pre-service training is free at four faculties of education of public
universities for those high school graduates who wish to become secondary school teachers. 39
However, this is insufficient to fulfill the national demand and there are also high direct costs of
participating (travel, lodging, meals and other). Universities also offer distance learning and
flexible course options for teachers that would like to obtain a graduate certificate. 40 However,
program up-take is rather low due to the lack of incentives for teachers to actually graduate.

In-service training for basic education teachers tends to be fragmented and not well
articulated. Nationwide, more than 80 percent of teachers participate in more than one month of
training annually (MINED, 2016). Yet evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these courses is
almost non-existent. In-service training modules and workshops are frequently prepared by

39Two faculties are located in Managua, one in the western part of the Pacific region, and one on the Caribbean Coast.
40Currently, with external funding, MINED is offering a scholarship for those teachers that are participating in the 3
years professionalization courses.

MINED directorates covering pre-school, primary and secondary schooling. They are
implemented in coordination with the General Directorate of Teacher Training and its territoria l
delegations. In addition, in each school cluster throughout the country participates in monthly peer
group sessions held to review classroom experience, prepare plans for the following month, and
receive training in specific topics chosen by MINED.

Moving forward,          one of the most important                areas for reform is the
duration/curriculum/format of teacher training to make it more modern and relevant. Like
in many other countries in LAC, improving teachers’ classroom practices is a clear policy priority
in Nicaragua (Bruns et al. 2015). The difficulty is of course the heterogeneity of the challenges.
Improving in-service teacher training programs will have a clear role to play. Currently, most of
the teacher, training programs are short, the curriculum is rather theoretical, and there is no focus
on classroom management skills. Selected examples of concrete areas for improvement (as
discussed in Bruns et al, 2015) include improving mastery of content, improving classroom
management, developing strategies for keeping students engaged, and fostering peer collaboratio n
(across and within schools).

Even though the Government has recognized some of these challenges, it is still unclear
whether and how they will be addressed in the years ahead. The possibility of developing an
effective teacher policy is threatened by the lack of an integrated institutional mechanism for
coordinating student recruitment for teacher training and other human resource policies within
MINED, INATEC, and the CNU. Working groups of university professors and students from some
of the education faculties of the institutions members of the CNU are currently engaged in
development and implementation of strategies to strengthen teacher training in both traditional and
vocational and professional schools.

Overall, the education sector also faces difficulties in gathering basic information/data on
education inputs and outputs, which presents another challenge for better inter-institutio nal
coordination. There is no sector-wide plan for the systematic and consistent collection of data,
and the mechanisms for identifying, analyzing and making use of critical educational informa tio n
for policymaking purposes are not only uncoordinated, but also tend to be undefined within each
institution. Furthermore, the statistics departments of MINED, INATEC, and the CNU are weak
and lack capacity to collect, organize, analyze, and disseminate information. They are not in
regular communication and regularly fail to collaborate with one another on critical matters.

Once more, there is no education management and information system to support decision
making and public information mechanisms. Statistical information for the education sector is
extremely limited and controlled by the Office of the Presidency, which only shares limited data
to the institutions that lead each sub-system. National and international student assessments have

Finally, information about overall education sector performance is limited and access tends also
to be restricted, thereby constraining both analysis and transparency/accountability. Some of these
issues have already been identified as critical areas of focus important by the Government and
selected efforts are underway to coordinate and enhance systematic and consistent data collectio n
(such as software that have been adapted to process statistical data and produce regular reports),
though more could be done.

V.              Performance and Challenges in Health

V.1             Recent Evolution of Health Public Spending

Since 2007, shares of public spending in the health sector in Nicaragua have increased both
as a percent of GDP and as a share of total social spending. From 2007 to 2014, total public
spending in health’s share of GDP increased from 3.81 to 5.1 percent, representing a 34 percent
increase (Figure 67), placing the country’s share just below Costa Rica among Central American
countries (Figure 68). This increase was also reflected in the public spending on health share of
total social spending, which increased by 36 percent (from 38 percent in 2007 to 52 percent in
2013), making Nicaragua’s health share of public social spending the highest in Central America
(Figure 69).

Despite these achievements, Nicaragua’s per capita spending in real terms remained low,
with numbers closer to Guatemala and Honduras. In constant 2007 US dollars, it remained the
same, at US$145, from 2007 to 2014, with fluctuations in between. Over this period, Nicaragua
alternated with Honduras and Guatemala in having the lowest real per capita public spending on
health in Central America (Figure 70).

From 2007 to 2013, Nicaragua’s public share of total health spending increased from 47 to
53 percent. As a result, the private share of total health spending decreased from 56 percent to 47
percent (Figure 71). In 2013, Nicaragua’s private share of total health spending (47 percent) was
lower than the averages for LAC (52 percent) and Central America (58 percent).

The increase in public spending on health contributed to the decrease in household
spending’s share of total health expenditures, although the latter remains significant in
Nicaragua. The out of pocket spending share of total health expenditures declined by 11 percent,
from 53 percent in 2007 to 47 percent in 2013. Of the households that incurred out of pocket
expenditures in 2014, over 55 percent of them paid for medicines. In addition, a lower percentage
of households in the lowest income quintile incurred any health related expenditure of any type
(Figure 72). This is partly a result of increased coverage by the Social Security’s Sickness Program
and partly due to the Government’s policy of providing free access to health services in public
health facilities.

However, out of pocket health spending shares of per capita consumption increased for the
second and third income quintiles by around one percent although it slightly declined for the
highest income quintile (Figure 73). At the same time, the share of catastrophic expenditure s 42
declined for four of the income quintiles, with the poorest income quintile experiencing the largest
decrease. However, the percentage of poor households (second income quintile) that had
catastrophic expenditures comprising at least 30 percent of their budget share increased (Figure
74), suggesting that health system reforms (e.g. free care in public facilities) still need to benefit a
larger segment of the poor.

Among public sector institutions in the health sector, MINSA is the main provider of services
and accounts for the largest share of public spending on health. MINSA covers approximate ly
76 percent of the population, while the Sickness and Maternity Program of the INSS and the Armed
Forces and Police cover 22 percent and less than one percent, respectively. The other one percent

is covered by private insurance. MINSA also accounts for the largest share of public health
spending, although its share has decreased from 74 percent in 2007 to 62 percent in 2013. The
INSS has the second largest share, which increased from 26 percent in 2007 to 37 percent in 2013
(Figure 75). Regions accounted for the remaining 1 percent in 2013. 43

Although the INSS covers a much smaller share of the population, its per capita spending is
greater than MINSA’s. The INSS covers approximately one third of the population covered by
MINSA. While the difference in per capita spending between the two institutions has decreased
between 2010 and 2014, INSS’s remains higher than that of MINSA (Figure 76).




43 Aside from the institutions that produce health care services as primary or secondary economic activity under the
General Government, the Regional Government of the Atlantic Region also plays a role. Law No. 28 supports the

Salaries comprise the largest share of MINSA’s public spending, followed by non-personne l
services and medicines. In 2002, approximately 54 percent of MINSA’s spending on health was
for salaries, while 17 percent was for non-personnel services and another 11 percent was for
medicines (Figure 77). In 2014, MINSA allocated a smaller share of its budget to personnel (50
percent), which is lower than the shares allocated to salaries by other Central American countries
and lower than the average share allocated by middle income countries (52.5 percent) (Figure 78).
During the same year, MINSA increased the budget share for medicines to 14 percent, reflecting
the Government’s efforts to reduce out of pocket expenditures, and increased the allocation for the
centralized purchase of essential medicines. 44 This budget change also reflects the Government’ s
commitment to increasing the availability of contraceptives as part of MOSAFC (Box 8).

The Government’s budget allocation to purchase contraceptives over the last 10 years reflects a
sustained commitment to reproductive health. Since 2006, the Government has progressive ly
incorporated purchase of contraceptives into its budget, covering the amount previously
financed by donors. MINSA’s share of the total budget for the procurement of contraceptive
methods increased from 0.60 percent in 2006 to 77.16 percent in 2014.

In terms of programs, MINSA’s budget appears to be fairly equally distributed between
hospitals and primary health care services. Although hospitals accounted for the largest share
of Nicaragua’s budget for programs at 45 percent, it is lower than the 49 percent LAC average
(Figure 79). Nicaragua’s share of spending on hospitals is just slightly higher than its allocatio ns
to primary care (43 percent), while it allocates 11 percent to administrative services and
coordination at the Central and Local levels (MINSA, 2015 and ICEFI). This budget distributio n
reflects the MOSAFC principles, which include the Government’s commitment to shifting towards
more efficient and effective budgeting practices. Specifically, the Government has been changing
the way it allocates funds to the main hospitals in the country, moving from an historical budget
allocation to a results based budget allocation, in an effort to create more responsibility for budget
implementation. The effort implies not only providing additional training for the hospital directors,
but also a change from traditional fiscal programing of budget allocations.

The share of the population that reports that it is ‘very satisfied’ or ‘fairly satisfied’ with
public hospitals in Nicaragua is higher than several Central American countries and a subset
of LAC. As hospitals comprise the largest share of public health spending among health programs,
user satisfaction with hospitals is an important indicator of quality. From 2007 to 2011, overall
satisfaction with hospitals (Figure 80) significantly increased from 53 percent to 72 percent in
Nicaragua, which is mostly explained by the free provision of service, testing, and medications.

V.2     Health Outcomes and Challenges

Nicaragua faces a triple burden of disease. While there remains an unfinished agenda related to
communicable diseases, malnutrition, and sexual reproductive health, the overall burden of disease
is shifting toward increased chronic diseases and external causes (including violence and injury),
with an increasing number of deaths related to chronic vascular diseases, tumors, and major
traumas. Life expectancy has increased from an average of 70.8 over the 2000-2005 period to 74.5
for 2010- 2015, and the country’s epidemiological profile reflects the characteristics of increasing
urbanization, modernization of lifestyles, and aging populations, as chronic diseases have
overtaken infectious diseases as the major causes of death and mortality by external causes is
increasing.

The trends in mortality rates from 1975 to 2014 show a 16 percent decline in mortality due
to infectious diseases and a 20 percent increase in chronic disease mortality, while external
causes slightly decreased but remained higher than mortality due to infectious diseases. The
decline in mortality from infectious diseases was driven by the progress made in reducing maternal
and child mortality rates. Conversely, the increase in chronic disease mortality is explained by the
increase in circulatory system related diseases (hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and ischemic
heart diseases) and tumor-related deaths. Trauma mortality was due to accidents and violence
(Figure 81).

V.2.1 Achievements and challenges in Maternal and Child Health

Progress towards reducing the maternal mortality rate, Millennium Development Goal
(MDG) 5,45 was rather slow until 2012. As of 2009, there were still as many as 62.5 maternal
deaths per 100,000 live births (Figure 82). An in depth analysis of maternal mortality showed that
non-obstetric and indirect causes played an important role in reducing maternal mortality. MDG-
related efforts included improving institutional births, providing immediate post-delivery check-
ups, and implementing a ‘maternal houses’ strategy to provide women from rural areas a place to
stay to ensure safe and assisted delivery and post-natal care,46 among others. With these efforts,
Nicaragua’s national average of institutional birth deliveries reached 75 percent in 2012, includ ing
a significant increase in the coverage rate for the lowest income quintile from 32 percent in 1998
to 65 percent in 2011-2012 (Table 5). Institutional delivery coverage rates ranged from 49 percent
to 100 percent among Local System for Integral Health Care ( Sistema Local de Atención Integral
en Salud, SILAIS) over the same 2011-2012 period. The national average for post-delivery
checkups reached 82 percent in 2012, ranging from 30 to 95 percent across SILAIS. The number
of maternal houses increased from 100 in 201 to 169 in 2014, providing 40,192 women a place to
stay prior to giving birth. This has combined with other measures for improving the quality of


45 Nicaragua’s goal is to reduce maternal deaths from 190 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 40 per 100,000 live births
by 2015.
46 The maternal house s strategy complements institutional delivery and it is important for women’s birth plans. It

includes a short stay prior to and post-delivery. The Birth Plan is agreed between the parents to be and community
leaders and includes details such as the possible use of maternal houses, transportation plan, a support network to care
for the children left at home, and possible emergency scenarios. In 2014 alone MINSA identified 46,536 birth plans.

care47 to contribute to reducing of the maternal mortality rate to 37.9 per 100,000 live births in
2014. Nonetheless, challenges related to quality of care and inefficiencies persist in the system,
such as the high incidence of cesarean sections.

Despite the progress made in reducing maternal mortality, maternal mortality rates remain
high in a number of areas. For example, several SILAIS still have high maternal mortality rates,
namely Boaco (78.5 per 100,000 live births), Jinotega (55.9 per 100,000 live births) and RACCS
(160 per 100,000 live births).

While adolescent pregnancy has decreased, it remains a large contributor to elevated
maternal mortality rates and continues to be a challenge with widespread social and
economic implications. The rate of pregnancy among girls 10 to 19 years of age decreased from
25.9 percent in 2006-2007 to 24.4 percent in 2011-2012,48 but remained at a high level. Many

response and support.

young girls either drop out of school and become pregnant or drop out of school due to pregnancy
and face a vicious cycle of poverty. The national issue of adolescent pregnancy prompted MINSA
to support the preparation and implementation of the National Strategy for Integral Health and
Development of Adolescents 2012-2015, which calls for: (i) more efficient access to and delivery
of health care services to young mothers; (ii) an increase in the number of maternal houses in areas
with dispersed rural populations; (iii) a multi-sector response from MINED, MIFAN and
MINJUVE; and, (iv) carrying out training of trainers for teachers from fifth to twelfth grade,
among others.

Nicaragua’s infant mortality rate has decrease d but remains higher in rural areas than
urban areas. Data from the 2012 demographic and health survey (Encuesta Nicaragüense de
Demografía y Salud, ENDESA) shows that Nicaragua’s under-five mortality rate declined from
42 to 17 per 1,000 live births between 1998 and 2011-2012 (Figure 83). This is partly due to an
overall decrease in adolescent pregnancy, as well as an increase in the share of babies born to
adolescent mothers that were delivered in health facilities from 74 percent in 2007 to 94 percent
in 2014. However, despite all efforts, mortality rates in rural areas remain more than 10 points
higher than those in urban settings, confirming the need for inter-sectoral interventions such as
improving access to potable water to further reduce child mortality. For example, in 2014, 60
percent of the rural population lacked access to potable water.

The nutritional status of Nicaraguans reflects the current epidemiological transition and is
a large source of concern because of increasing national overweight and obesity rates. Data
from the ENDESA household survey shows improvements in chronic malnutrition and total under-
nutrition among children under 5 years of age. From 1998 to 2011-2012, chronic malnutritio n
decreased by 8 percentage points and total undernutrition decreased by 15 percentage points (Table

6). However, Nicaragua is now reporting a different type of malnutrition: increasing rates of
overweight and obesity, particularly among children and women of reproductive age. The
prevalence of overweight49 among boys and girls under 20 years of age is 14.8 and 23.4 percent,
respectively. Overweight prevalence was much higher among men and women over 20 years of
age, at 43 and 67.6 percent, respectively. 50 Both overweight and obesity pose considerable risks
for the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases that have high economic and social
costs for society.

V.2.2 Achievements and Challenges in Infectious and Non-Communicable Diseases

Despite infectious disease control efforts, Nicaragua faces a wave of new infectious diseases.
During 2014, the epidemiological behavior of infectious diseases was moderate and had a tendency
to decrease, with the exception of the newly introduced chikungunya virus disease, which had
epidemic-like behavior (Table 7). A new threat, the Zika virus, emerged in 2015. By 2016, the
behavior of the Aedes vectors and the reported, suspected, and confirmed cases led the Governme nt
to believe that 2016 would be an epidemic year with negative consequences for the health of the
population. While dengue, chikungunya and now Zika are expected to appear in most SILAIS,
malaria is mostly present in Bilwi, Las Minas, RACCS, Jinotega and Chinandega, which account
for the 96 percent increase in reported positive cases.

Progress towards halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV, MDG 6, has been
mixed, with more progress made in reducing mortality than in stopping the spread of the
virus. Nicaragua reports important advances in the care for people affected by HIV, with the
HIV/AIDS related death rate having declined dramatically since 2000 (Figure 84). HIV mortality

is not among the first ten causes of death in Nicaragua, as is the case in Honduras, Guatemala and
Panama.51 Despite efforts to provide treatment and improve adherence to Anti-Retroviral Therapy,
the incidence of HIV is rapidly increasing, from 4.1 new cases per 100,000 in 2011 to 19.9 per
100,000 in 2013. 69.9 percent of new HIV infections occur among 30-35 year olds, followed by
20.7 percent among 20-27 year old and 9 percent among 15 to 19 year olds. (UNICEF, 2013). In
this context, renewed efforts are needed to ensure sustainable investments to prevent HIV/AIDS
in Nicaragua.

V.2.3 Access to Health Insurance

In 2014, over 76 percent of the population reported not having any type of health insurance
and mostly relying on the public health services network. Over 60 percent of the population
reported not having any insurance, ranging from 90 percent in the lowest income quintile to 64
percent in the highest income quintile. As noted above, the social health insurance of the INSS
covers around 22 percent of the population. Affiliation with the INSS, as expected, is highest in
the highest income quintile (34 percent) and lowest in the poorest income quintile (9 percent). Box
9 provides more information about the INSS. Less than one percent of the population is insured
by the Military/Police insurance, while one percent is covered by private insurance (Table 8).

                              Box 9: The Sickness and maternity program of
                         the national social security system managed by the INSS
  The current social health insurance system covers formal employees from the public and private
  sectors. Voluntary coverage is offered for the self-employed, clergy, and employers and workers
  previously covered by the Social Health Insurance. Temporary agricultural workers, the military and
  police personnel are not included.

  In 2014, 735,014 workers across 30,108 enterprises were actively insured. Of the 30,108 enterprises,
  92 percent provide integral social security coverage, while 8 percent provide only old age, pension
  and professional risks insurance (workmen compensation). In 2014, around 89 percent of the active
  beneficiaries (658,808; around 10 percent of the total population) were covered by the health
  insurance program (sickness and maternity program) as part of the integral social security regime.
  Around 95 percent the active beneficiaries of the health insurance program belonged to the
  compulsory system. The number of active insured from a voluntary affiliation program (32,045)
  represented around five percent of the population covered by the health insurance program (0.5
  percent of the total population of the country). During the 2010-2014 period, the number of
  economically active population and their beneficiaries contributing under the social health insurance
  scheme managed by the INSS increased from 9 to 11 percent of the total population. The number of
  beneficiaries increased from 21 percent of the population in 2010, to an estimated 27 percent in 2014*
  (to 1.6 million). Contributions grew faster than the number of beneficiaries.
 *Estimation based on 2014 population that includes the potential family members benefited by the program, it
 differs from the MIC household survey results.


V.2.4 Health Care Utilization

In 2014, the share of the population that reported an illness was slightly higher in rural areas
(51 percent) than in urban areas (48 percent), while utilization rates of both public and
private facilities were higher in urban areas. In particular, 56 percent of urban dwellers used
outpatient public services, compared to 48 percent of rural dwellers. In addition, a larger
percentage of urban dwellers (14 percent) used outpatient private services compared with rural
dwellers (11 percent), although the difference was smaller. On the other hand, there was a larger
difference in the utilization rates between the lowest income quintile (51 percent) and the highest
income quintile (65 percent), and utilization rates of public outpatient services were greater among
the lower income quintiles (Figure 85).

In the 2014 ENDESA, no one reported paying for consultation in public sector facilities,
although expenses were reported for seeking care in private facilities and for medications .
Approximately 12 percent of the population paid for consultations in the private sector and 55.4
percent reported paying for medications. Consultations paid for by lower income quintiles took
place in private facilities, which also include healers. While the payment for consultations is lower
in the lower income quintiles, payment for medications is an important share of expenditures for
all income quintiles. The average payment for consultations was 275 cordobas (US$9.50), with a
difference between the lowest and highest income quintiles of over 50 percent. The average
payment for medications was 336 cordobas (US$11.60), with a fourfold difference between the
highest and lowest income quintiles. This indicates that access to medicines is an issue faced by
people seeking care in publicly provided health services. The 2014 ENDESA also reported that 70
percent of survey participants did not pay for laboratory, x-rays or other support testing. Among
the 30 percent who paid for the testing, over 40 percent were in the highest income quintile, but
still over 15 percent from the first and second income quintiles also paid for these services.

MINSA has doubled the use of publicly provided health services in recent years. The number
of primary health care consultations increased from 8.5 million in 2006 to 16.7 million in 2013.
Over the same period, hospital-based consultations rose by 125 percent (from 1.3 million in 2006
to 3.1 million in 2013), while hospital discharges increased by 46 percent, and surgeries performed
rose by 120 percent.52 As a result of the inclusive elements of the Nicaragua health care model,

increased medical waste production. This issue is discussed in the institutional and governance
section.

Consultations for infectious and chronic diseases and external causes among those who
reported being ill in the last month during the 2014 ENDESA reveal the changing
epidemiological profile of the country by income group. Among the sick who sought care, most
consulted for infectious diseases (65.72 percent). This was particularly high in the lowest income
quintile. At the same time, chronic diseases and external causes accounted for higher shares of
consultations for the highest income quintile (Figure 86). These results may indicate a lack of
follow up of chronic diseases that require constant supervision, such as diabetes and hypertensio n
in the lower income quintile.

V.3        Institutional Arrangements

The Nicaraguan health system is composed of public and private institutions that
interconnect with each other in the provision of health care services. The provision of health
care in the public sector is shared by MINSA, the INSS, and the Armed Forces and Police. These
institutions directly provide health care services (MINSA, Armed Forces and Police) and finance
the purchase of health care from private providers (INSS). MINSA and the INSS operate very
differently. For example, the value of the services provided by MINSA are the costs incurred in
the production and delivery of health care related goods and services through the Governme nt
network of health care service facilities and ambulatory units and teams. On the other hand, INSS

                                                               88
                    Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


expenditures on health care related services correspond to the cost of purchasing health care related
goods and services from private providers, mainly at pre-negotiated or quasi-market prices. 54
These providers may charge additional co-payment for services, whereas services provided at
MINSA facilities are free of charge or at non-significant prices.55 The General Health Law (Ley
General de Salud No. 423) published in 2002 mandates the provision of free health care for
vulnerable populations, with an emphasis on maternal and child health care programs, as well as
provision of health care services for senior and disabled citizens.

The provision of different health care packages through MINSA and INSS results in
households seeking care from both public and private providers to cover service gaps. As a
result, the public system effectively subsidizes private providers and private insurers by absorbing
the catastrophic expenditure of both sub-systems and providing care to the population that needs
more sophisticated treatments.

Since 2007, provision of health care under MINSA has been based on the MOSAFC. The
MOSAFC covers preventive health care and community participation, in addition to the provision
of curative care under the Integral Health Care Model. Under MOSAFC, the entire population is
covered, free of charge, with health services appropriately oriented to individuals, families, and
households. MOSAFC operates at the community level with health teams dedicated to a specific
geographic sector with a defined population base. These Family and Community Health Teams
are responsible for the provision of basic health care services, with basic medical equipment,
medicines, and goods at their disposal. In addition, this model relies on the 18 SILAIS to
coordinate the municipal networks in their jurisdiction. MOSAFC is considered the
operationalization of the health plan presented in article No. 105 of the Nicaraguan Constitutio n,
outlining a path to achieving equity in the health sector by providing comprehensive, free, quality
health care guided by the principle of universality, solidary and equity. The Government defined
12 steps in the implementation of the MOSAFC, 56 reflecting the important role of community
participation, definition of responsibilities, integration of the health network, and the need for
monitoring and evaluation of the model.

The distribution of the health facility network and the lack of readiness of equipment and
supplies present some challenges in providing quality access to all areas. The health network
is comprised of 1,374 health facilities, of which 84 percent are family health posts (Figure 87).
Twenty seven hospitals located mostly in Managua are responsible for the more complex health

54 Some hospital services are contracted from public sector institutions, from the Ministry of Defense.
55 The different valuation of the goods and services provided by MINSA and those purchased by INSS’s SHI scheme
is a major limitation for adding-up and/or comparing the real value of public expenditures throughout these
institutions.

care, while 37 primary hospitals provide less complex health care. In addition, 6,619 casas bases57
support the actions of the health posts and brigades58 visiting smaller towns. The disproportiona te
distribution of health facilities, particularly with regard to Managua and the rest of the SILAIS
creates challenges in providing services. In addition, delays in opportune maintenance, repair and
repositioning of equipment and infrastructure is a major bottleneck in delivering good quality
health care services. Despite the creation of the Center for Maintenance of Medical Equipment in
199259 as a decentralized entity with administrative capabilities assigned to MINSA, the Center
does not have an assigned budget line, meaning that it has to financially compete with other
MINSA priorities. Ensuring better equipment maintenance is not yet part of MINSA’s institutio na l
culture.

From 2005 to 2015, the number of human resources working in the sector increased by 32
percent, though staffing gaps remain. Although this increase in personnel, comprised largely by
medical staff, has allowed the country to move closer to international health standards, Nicaragua’s
ratio of 16 health workers to 10,000 inhabitants still falls below the WHO standard of 25 per 10,000
inhabitants. Under MOSAFC, the number of medical doctors in the public sector doubled from
2,717 in 2005 to 5,794 2015, while the number of nurses grew from 2,228 to 4,726, representing
at least a 50 percent increase for both groups during this period. These increases resulted in
improved ratios: from 4.98 to 9.32 physicians per 10,000 population and from 4.09 to 7.60 nurses

per 10,000 population, which are both closer to the recommended international standards. The
increase in health technicians during the same period was lower (27 percent), while the increase
in dentists’ was very low (5 percent), resulting in a ratio of only 0.42 dentists per 10,000 inhabita nts
in 2015. Dentists now account for the largest gap in health human resources in the Nicaraguan
public health sector. Coverage outreach is complemented with the organized activities of the
Family and Community Health Teams, 60 which are in charge of household follow-ups, particular ly
for maternal and child care. The Modelo de Atención de Salud Intercultural de Región Autonoma
Atlántico Norte and the Modelo de Atención de Salud Intercultural de Región Autonoma del
Atlantico Sur61 are the most active of these efforts to provide services to the highly dispersed
population in the northern and southern parts of the Atlantic Coast.

The increase in health care staff and production of health care services have also resulted in
an increase in the production of medical waste. The public health sector is progressive ly
investing in the training, equipment, and management of health waste within health facilities.
However, the increase in production of services, in particular the more sophisticated manageme nt
of cancer treatments and auxiliary methods of diagnostics, require more care in the manageme nt
of medical waste. Much more needs to be done in terms of protecting and training health personnel

community leaders. The visits are part of their way to reach, capture, and follow up with the target population.

their respective locations.

in managing waste and ensuring the use of proper technology for the disposal and the
implementation of waste management plans for reference hospitals. Increased participation from
municipalities and MARENA are needed for the proper management of hazardous waste in public
disposal places.

Finally, after ten years of implementation of the MOSAFC model, an evaluation of its
effectiveness and efficiency and the functioning of the health network is needed. The
Government prepares and follows multi-annual Strategic Plans62 to define priorities and establish
goals and presents annual progress reports (Informe de Gestion Anual) summarizing advances
made in relation to these goals. These reports focus on annual health results and outline challenges,
opportunities, and resources needed. However, the reports do not assess health network
performance, the efficiency of public health interventions, the efficiency of use of funds and other
resources, or the role and extent of community particip ation, among others. Given the country’s
financial situation and the limited budget assigned to health, it would be important for MINSA to
undertake an in-depth review and identify ways to optimize the use of available resources to yield
maximum benefits.

VI. Performance and Challenges in Social Protection and Labor

VI.1       Recent Evolution of Social Protection and Labor Public Spending

Public spending in SPL has grown significantly in the past years both in real per capita terms
and as a share of GDP. SPL spending as a share of GDP grew by 9 percent on average per year,
rising from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 4.4 percent in 2014 (Figure 88). This annual growth
was far above the rest of Central American countries, with El Salvador trailing slightly behind at
6 percent, Costa Rica and Guatemala both averaging 3 percent, and Honduras and Panama showing
an average decline of 1 percent. In per capita terms, Nicaragua’s SPL spending also grew US$93
in 2007 to US$124 (in 2007 PPP dollars) in 2014. However, it is still quite low compared to the
Central American average of US$416 (Figure 89). The SPL sector in Nicaragua accounted for 33
percent of social spending in 2014 compared to 24 percent in 2007.

A key explanation of SPL spending growth over this period was the increase in both social
security and social assistance allocations. The SPL system in Nicaragua is composed of both
contributive programs (pensions) and non-contributive programs (social assistance, labor market
programs, and subsides). Social security spending has increased in recent years, from 1.9 percent
of GDP in 2007 to 3.5 percent in 2014 (Figure 90). This increase is mainly due to a pension reform
that introduced a reduced proportional age pension pursuant to Decree No. 28 of 2013. Similar ly,
social assistance spending has also increased, representing almost twice the spending in 2007 in
real terms and growing from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 0.9 percent in 2014. However,
Nicaragua’s SPL spending in social assistance is the lowest in Central America, while it is near
the average for social security specifically (Figure 91). Taken as a whole, SPL spending is
relatively low in regional terms, only surpassing Guatemala in Central America.

Social security accounts for 80 percent of total SPL spending. The social security sector is
administered by the INSS. Total spending in social security has been increasing since 1994 at a
rate of 9 percent per year, while the total number of beneficiaries increased by 4 percent per year
over the same period, reaching 194 thousand people by 2014 (Figure 92). Most of the spending is
allocated to ordinary pensions with an upward trend over time, reaching 90 percent of total security
spending. The share of social security spending on war victims and other special regime has
declined over time to 9 percent and 1 percent in 2014, respectively, compared to 20 percent and
10.7 percent in 1994, respectively (Figure 93).

Despite accounting for just 20 percent of SPL spending, social assistance has increased in
importance in recent years. The SNBS coordinates a set of multi-sectoral social assistance
programs, including Programa Amor, a social care program for children, youth and the elderly
with a life-cycle approach, as well as disaster prevention, mitigation, and attention programs run
by the National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and Attention ( Sistema Nacional de
Prevencion de Desastres, SINAPRED). Spending on social assistance increased as a share of GDP
from 0.5 percent in 2007 to 0.9 percent in 2014. Despite this increase, Nicaragua’s social assistance
spending is still the lowest in Central America (Figure 94), while also trailing behind the LAC and
world averages of 1.3 and 1.6 percent of GDP (average for 2010-2014), respectively. Unlike its
neighbors, Nicaragua does not allocate resources to cash transfer programs and is the country that
spends the most on ALMPs in the region.

Untargeted subsidies and ALMPs explain the majority of the increase in social assistance
and labor spending in the last few years. As a share of GDP, ALMPs increased from 0.3 percent
of GDP in 2007 to 0.53 percent of GDP in 2014 and account for the largest share of social
assistance spending. In the last few years, ALMP spending averaged 60 percent of social assistance
and labor spending, followed by family and children (20 percent) and subsidies (13 percent)
(Figure 95). Among Central American countries, Nicaragua has the highest share of public
spending on ALMPs followed by Costa Rica (0.4 percent), Honduras (0.3 percent), El Salvador
and Panama (0.2 percent each) and Guatemala (0.1 percent). The increase in ALMPs spending is
due to an increase in coverage of training programs for young people and employees (who
contribute 2 percent of their payroll salary for INATEC funding), and the launch of mobile courses
for people with limited economic resources from semi-urban and rural areas of the country.
Subsidy allocations increased by 28 percent per year from 0.02 percent of GDP in 2007 to 0.12
percent of GDP in 2014. Subsidy benefits include energy and water consumption for retirees, as
well as energy consumption subsidies for economically vulnerable settlements, which were
launched in 2009 (Figure 96). Moreover, still very few resources are directly allocated to families
and children reflecting the same trend of the amount spent on untargeted subsidies.

VI.2.1 Social Security

The social security system is administered by INSS and provides benefits for old-age,
disability, illness, death, maternity and occupational risk. As previously noted, Nicaragua has
both contributory and non-contributory pension regimes. The contributory general regime works
as a pay-as-you-go system. In order to finance the system, employers contribute 6 percent of the
employee’s salary, while employees contribute 4 percent. 63 The non-contributory pension system
assists people living in extreme poverty, the military or war victims. A reform was approved on
December 20, 2013 to address the sustainability of the pay-as-you-go pension system, which
included a phase- in increase in the employers’ contributions from 7 percent prior to 2014 to 10
percent by 2017,64 though employee contributions remained unaltered at 4 percent. In addition,
old age and disability pension benefits for those making over two minimum wages was reduced
under this reform. As a result of these changes, revenue and expenditures improved. However, this
was countered by an increase in expenditure due to the introduction of a reduced pension in 2013
and a legislated increase in these pensions in 2015. As referenced above, Decree No. 28 effective ly
extended pension coverage to INSS members who had between 250 and 749 weeks of
contributions, compared to the minimum of 750 weeks of contributions previously required to be
eligible for an old age pension. Table 10 shows a breakdown of the main social insurance
programs, including description, target population, expenditures and coverage.

63ECLAC (2013).
64 The detailed phased increase plan follows the following incremental increases: from 7 percent to 8 percent by
01/01/2014; 9 percent by 01/01/2015; 9.5 percent by 01/01/2016; and finally reaching 10 percent by 01/01/2017.

While overall social security coverage has increased, Nicaragua still has one of the lowest
contributions to the system in LAC. The share of employees 15-64 years old contributing to the
system has increased by 43 percent in the last few years, growing from 18 percent in 2001 to 26
percent in 2014 (Figure 97). Despite this positive trend, social security coverage is low compared
to other countries in LAC, though remains higher than Guatemala and Honduras in Central
America. While barely 26 percent of employees contribute to the system in Nicaragua, the
contribution rates for Costa Rica and Panama were 69 and 60 percent, respectively (Figure 98).

The share of elderly covered by pensions is on the rise, yet still around 80 percent of the
poorest elderly do not have access. The share of the elderly that benefit from social security
increased from less than 10 percent in 2001 to 24 percent in 2014 (Figure 99). However, pension
coverage did not increase at the same pace for all consumption quintiles. The poorest quintiles
have not benefited as much as the richest, as the increase in coverage has been registered mainly
in the top quintiles of the distribution. Pension coverage among the rich in 2014 was more than
twice the coverage in 2001 (38 percent compared to 14 percent), a phenomenon associated with
the informality of the labor market. Among the poorest quintiles, there has been a modest increase
in the past few years, but barely 6 percent of the poorest receive pension benefits. In addition,
compared to its neighbors, Nicaragua has one of the lowest access to pensions among the elderly
and the second highest access gap between the poor and the rich (only below Honduras) (Figure
100). The country has less than half the coverage of Panama (68 percent) and Costa Rica (65
percent). Therefore, the elderly poor in Nicaragua are less protected than Panama, Costa Rica, and
El Salvador. Coverage among the elderly poor could be increased by strengthening the non-
contributory pension’s scheme.

The replacement rate of the contributory system is high, and there are serious concerns
related to its sustainability. The replacement rate is currently 100 percent for minimum wage
workers, declining to 80 percent for the highest wage workers if they have contributed the
minimum of 15 years. In 2014, after a wide multi-sectoral dialogue and consensus among
employees, employers and unions, the Government undertook a reform of the pay-as-you-go
system to address its fiscal sustainability. As discussed, the reform included a phased-in increase
in employer contributions and linking pension increases to increases in the average wage. It was
calibrated to extend the sustainability of INSS to 2031. While revenue has improved, this has been
outweighed by increased expenditure due to a legislated increase in these pensions in 2015, and
the introduction of a “reduced” pension granted to individuals with 5-14 years of contributions. At
the same time, the investment returns of the reserve fund have been low. On current trends, the
INSS is projected to start running persistent deficits by 2017, and the reserve fund is expected to
be depleted by 2024.65 In the Financial and Economic Program (2014-2018), the Government
agreed to ensure that the investment plan for the INSS resources would be aligned with the
principles of the financial plan and the regulations for these investments would be aligned with
best international practices. To-date, the Government has adopted the necessary reforms to extend
the sustainability of the pay-as-you-go system, but there is room for additional parametric reforms
over the medium-term.

VI.2.2 Social Assistance and Social Care Services

During the past few years, Nicaragua has expanded the coverage of social assistance and
social care services. Unlike several countries in the region, Nicaragua does not have cash transfer
programs, though it used to have one called the Red de Protección Social, which was discontinued
in 2007 (Box 10). Instead, it has a number of other social assistance programs, such as social care
services, family and child benefits, school feeding, education benefits, and housing and emergency
benefits, among others.66 Programs are both universal, as well as targeted to the poor and
vulnerable.67 Social assistance programs include around 46 programs managed by 22 institutio ns
that provide support mainly for children, women, the elderly and disabled. In terms of coverage,
Merienda Escolar, Mochila Escolar, and Programa Amor stand out in terms of coverage and
budget. Most of the programs are small compared to the risk population (World Bank, 2009). Table
11 shows a breakdown of the main social assistance programs, including description, target
population, expenditures and coverage.




66 The government implemented the Social Protection Network ( Red de Protección Social ) during the period 2002-
2006, which included a conditional cash transfer program for people living in extreme poverty, with corresponsibilities
in the areas of health and education. With the elections in 2007 the Red de Protección Social was discontinued.
67 Some programs such as Usura Cero , Hambre Cero , Plan Techo have specific eligibility rules targeting in this way

in specific population.

                 Box 10: The experience of Nicaragua with Cash Transfer Programs
Unlike other countries in Central America and more than 60 countries in the world, Nicaragua does not
have a large conditional cash transfer (CCT) or unconditional cash transfer in place, though it has recently
introduced a small scaled cash transfer program for families with children and youth at risk. However, it
used to have one of the earliest CCTs in the world, which was active from 2000 to 2006 and called the
Red de Protección Social. This program was discontinued following the 2007 presidential elections and
the subsequent change in Administration focus in terms of social assistance and social care.

The Red de Protección Social targeted poor households with children aged 7– 13 enrolled in primary
school grades 1– 4, as well as children 0-5 years old receiving health care services. It was implemented
by the Emergency Social Investment Fund and over the span of its lifetime, it reached 36,000 households.
The program has been thoroughly evaluated and is frequently cited in the social safety net international
literature as the CCT with the highest impact in terms of poverty reduction and increase in consumption
levels and in use of services. For instance, it was estimated that thanks to the program: (i) beneficiary
poverty incidence was reduced by 5 percentage points (from a baseline of 90 percent); (ii) per capita
consumption increased from 21 to 29 percent; (iii) enrollment among 7-13 year old children increased
by 12.8 percentage points (from a baseline of 72 percent); and (iv) the likelihood that children aged 0-3
years old were weighted at health center every six month increased by 13.1 percentage points (from a
baseline of 55.4 percent).

Although the Red de Protección Social closed in 2007, MIFAN launched Programa Amor in 2008. Under
this program, MIFAN implements the Children and Youth at Risk Program that targets families with
children and youth at risk with a maximum age of 18 years. This Program introduced a “family grants”
component in 2011 and started providing services in 2013 to 19,000 families with children and youth at
risk. The latter aimed to improve extremely poor families’ basic conditions of welfare and social well-
being through the delivery of an array of services that included: (i) informative services about the
available social programs; (ii) community-based workshop modules aimed at promoting human capital
formation within the family, avoiding risky behaviors, and improving parental knowledge and families
use of social services; (iii) professional one-on-one family counseling services to provide more intensive
support to at-risk families and to prepare and implement a family improvement plan; and (iv) family
grants. The family grants were added as a compliment to the other above mentioned services, which are
regularly provided in the rest of the country through the Program. They were delivered to families in
selected localities with children under 13 years of age who were working or otherwise not participating
in the education system, and to adults (parents) who regularly attend community-based workshops. An
impact evaluation is programmed for 2017.

In general, social assistance programs have more coverage in rural areas, especially among
the extreme poor. Coverage is also higher in the most regions of the country with the most
vulnerable populations, including in the Central and Atlantic regions where the poverty rates are
44 and 39 percent, respectively, compared to 12 percent in Managua and 18 percent in the Pacific
region. Around 70 percent of the population of Nicaragua is covered by at least one of the
Government’s social assistance interventions, particularly given programs aimed at universa l
coverage of their target population groups, like Merienda Escolar, Mochila Escolar, and
Programa Amor (Table 12). However, coverage of other social programs is still very low and a
substantial number of the poor and extremely poor populations are not covered. Merienda Escolar,
the school feeding program, has the largest coverage of all social assistance programs, reaching

49.8 percent in 2014, and 65.6 of the poorest consumption quintile. Similarly, Programa Amor
benefits 44 percent of the total population and 64.1 percent of the extreme poor, while Mochila
Escolar provides services to 22.6 percent of the total population and around 30 percent of the
extreme poor. Finally, Paquete Alimentario Solidario, a supplemental feeding program covers 6.9
percent of total population and 11.4 percent of the lowest quintile. Outside of these four
interventions, other programs are quite small and none of them cover more than six percent of the
population.

Coverage among the poor could be enhanced by improving targeting accuracy. Around 50
percent of social assistance beneficiaries do not belong to the poorest two quintiles of the
consumption distribution (Figure 101). The low “targeting accuracy” of these interventions is
expected given that most of these programs aim for universal coverage of a specific group, such
as school-aged children. Most of beneficiaries do not belong to the poorest quintiles, with the
exception of Merienda Escolar, Programa Amor, Mochila Escolar, and Paquete Alimentario
Solidario, which have been gradually increasing their coverage of the poorest but still do not reach
more than 80 percent of the poor. In comparison, CCT programs in both Panama and Guatemala
have reached a targeting of more than 80 percent of the poorest quintiles (Panama 82 percent;
Guatemala 85 percent). In order to increase the coverage of the poor and vulnerable population

Still, preliminary estimates suggest that Nicaraguan social assistance interventions have had
an impact on poverty among beneficiaries. Using 2014 household survey data, national poverty
lines, and consumption aggregates, estimations of the impact of social assistance interventions on
poverty were carried out.68 At the national level, the programs seem to have little impact on poverty
since coverage is limited. The exception was the school feeding program ( Merienda Escolar),
which seemed to reduce extreme poverty by two percentage points and total poverty by one
percentage point. But when compared only among program beneficiaries, these interventions have
an important impact in both extreme and total poverty (Figure 102). Among the extreme poor,
Merienda Escolar had the highest contribution to reducing poverty at 3.4 percent, followed by the
Paquete Alimentario Solidario and the housing program, Plan Techo, at almost 3 percent each,
and finally the Hambre Cero program at 1.7 a percent reduction. Among the total poor, the Hambre
Cero program is associated with a 4.5 percent reduction in poverty, while the other programs
contributed to an average decrease of between 2 and 3 percentage points.




68   The impact of Programa Amor in poverty could not be estimated due to data limitations.

Programa Amor is the main social welfare program in Nicaragua, covering 44 percent of
Nicaraguans through its different multi-sectoral interventions. Programa Amor is a
component of SNBS and is coordinated by the Ministry of Communication and Citizens hip
Council for Social Development. Its main objective is to ensure the right of children to live a
dignified and happy childhood.69 The main interventions within Programa Amor include activitie s
such as: family accompaniment visits for selected families; access to a free public education for
children under 18 years of age; and provision of free health services for infants, children, pregnant
women and the elderly, among others. Although limited in scope, Programa Amor has a
component that provides cash transfers conditional on the participation of families in community
educational workshops. By 2014, Programa Amor had reached close to 300,000 children under 5
years of age with early childhood development services, reintegrated close to 21,000 children and
youth 7-18 years of age into the education system, and supported the participation of over 8,000
parents in family workshops. The most utilized program component in 2014 was health promotion
and provision of health services for children under 6 years of age, followed by health services for
those aged 60 and over, access to preschool education, provision of primary education for
vulnerable populations, namely overage students, pregnant women, and finally households
benefiting from family visits (Figure 103).



69 This program has the following components: 1) restore the rights of children to live in normal conditions, family
and safely in the streets; 2) restore the right to grow up with the love and care of a family; 3) create and enable Child
Development Centers for professional care of the sons and daughters of working mothers; 4) restore the right of
children to be registered in the Civil Registry; 5) ensure the right to care for specialized children and adolescents with
disabilities; 6) ensure the rights of children of migrant Nicaraguans or those deprived of t heir liberty; 7) restore the
right of children to grow and develop without working.

The data suggests that there is room to improve access to Programa Amor by poor
populations. In addition, there are further opportunities to empirically assess the impact of the
program. Data from 2014 shows that 52 percent of households benefiting from the Programa Amor
belong to the two poorest consumption quintiles, while an additional 21.9 percent belong to the
third consumption quintile. With 32.6 percent of beneficiaries of the Program from the top two
quintiles, the inclusion errors still present a challenge, though are relatively similar when
contrasted with other welfare programs in Nicaragua (26.2 percent for Mochila Escolar and 32.8
percent for Merienda Escolar). Thus, there is still room to improve the poverty focus of Programa
Amor, since a little less than half of poor families are still not being benefited by it. Programa
Amor has not yet been evaluated externally, which represents a potentially valuable opportunity to
assess its effectiveness and derive policy lessons for Nicaragua, as well as other countries in the
region.

The school feeding and school assistance programs are among the most important
interventions in the country. The school feeding program (Merienda Escolar) is impleme nted
by MINED. The Program benefits more than one million students in preschool, primary and
secondary schools. The Program is majority- funded with resources from the Nicaraguan Treasury,
with the balance covered by funds from the World Food Program (WFP), the Internatio na l
Coordination Project, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). In 2009, the Program
earned international recognition from the WFP as one of the best three interventions of its kind
across 70 countries. The merits of this Program are not only due to the scope of its coverage, but
also to its organization, transparency and administration of the distribution and delivery of the
food. Mochila Escolar, is also implemented by MINED, and includes free delivery of books,
uniforms, pencils, backpacks and shoes.

Nicaragua also has multiple feeding programs. Food security is one of the priorities of the
Government and, since 2007, associated productive agriculture programs have been designed to
complement in-kind transfers with the objective of strengthening food production for subsiste nce
or providing locally produced food for populations in need. The food package program ( Paquete
Alimentario Nacional) benefits the elderly, people with disabilities, and those who do not have
sufficient income with a basic food basket that includes staples such as rice, sugar, pasta, oil, and
beans. The Zero Hunger (Hambre Cero) program aims to strengthen the production of food for
self-subsistence in rural populations. The Program covers populations living in extreme poverty in
rural areas that have a plot of land to work on (one to 10 acres of land in rural or semi-rural areas).
The Program includes in-kind food and production allowances, as well as provision of technical
assistance to those families whose land is not suitable for raising animals. It also supports the sale
of surplus production in the domestic market. 70

Other social assistance programs include in-kind, cash and emergency benefits. Housing is
also another priority of the current Administration. Since 2007, the Government has impleme nted
a Plan Techo, a housing program that provides basic inputs to improve housing for the poorest
families. This intervention is very important in a country where about 80 percent of the population
still lacks adequate housing. In addition, through a special program called Brigada Medicos
Sandinistas, Ministry of Health sends doctors and auxiliary nurses to assist families by providing
medical check-ups to children, the elderly, and pregnant women, and by delivering necessary
medicines. Another intervention is Bono Solidario, which gives 750 cordobas to public employees
and the elderly. Finally, SINAPRED has been established to support preventive educational
activities or the attention of the aftermath of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, droughts, floods,
volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

Nicaragua also allocates a significant amount of resources to provision of electricity, water,
and public transportation subsidies, though these are highly regressive interventions. Around
0.1 percent of GDP is spent on subsidies to energy consumption and water for retirees, subsidies
for the use of urban public transport in the municipality of Managua, and energy subsidies in
economically vulnerable neighborhoods. However, since about 50 percent of the extreme poor do
not have access to electricity and less than 20 percent of the extreme poor have access to piped
water in their houses, they do not benefit from these subsidies (Figure 104). Therefore, the subsidy
ends up benefiting primarily non-poor households, those that would likely be able to pay without
tariff discounts. The percentage of total households with access to water and electricity that belong
to the two poorest quintiles is 36 and 16 percent, respectively (Figure 105). It is important to note
that this represents the lower bound estimate of the cost of electricity subsidy, as the bulk of
residential subsidies (for households that consume less than 150kilowatt hours/month) is financed

off-budget through contributions from Petrocaribe (Venezuela). As such, it is difficult to estimate

VI.2.3 Labor Market Indicators and Active Labor Market Policies

The unemployment rate in Nicaragua has decreased in the past few years, but remains
among the highest in Central America. In 2014, the unemployment rate among those between
18-65 years of age in Nicaragua was 6.2 percent, the second highest unemployment rate in Central
America behind Costa Rica (Figure 106). Nicaragua’s unemployment rate is not only above the
Central America region (4.8 percent), but is also slightly above the LAC region (6.1 percent).
Similar to many other Central American countries, Nicaragua unemployment rate is in single
digits. However, it should be noted that one third of the working population is in a situation of
underemployment. While the unemployment rate decreased from 13 percent in 1998 to 6.6 percent
in 2005,72 it grew to 7.5 percent in 2009 following the international crisis. However, by 2014 it
had decreased below pre-crisis levels to 5.9 percent.

Despite recent improvements to overall unemployment, it remains disproportionally high in
urban areas, among the youth, and among those with secondary and tertiary education.
Between 2005 and 2014, unemployment rates decreased for all groups except for the youth (15-
24 years old). As of 2014, the youth had the highest rate of unemployment in the country, at 11
percent (Figure 107). Similarly, unemployment rates for those with secondary or tertiary education
is more than twice of those with no education or primary education. Large gaps also persist
between urban and rural areas, as the unemployment rate in urban areas is 8 percent compared to
3 percent in rural areas.

The continuous increase in the minimum wage has played a positive role in reducing the large
wage gaps between skilled and unskilled workers (Figure 108). By law, the minimum wage

increases are negotiated every year in a tripartite commission made by the Government, the private
sector, and trade unions. Official increases are approved in the first quarter of each year stipulating
the changes for each sector, as well as the timeline for its application. Since 2007, other salary
adjustments have been approved by the Government with particular purposes. For example, in
October 2008, the Government approved an 18 percent increase in the minimum wage for all
employees in the public and private sector (the accumulated inflation in October 2008 was 20.3%).
In January 2009, all workers in both the health and education sectors received wage increases of
up to 16 percent of their salaries. In February 2010, the minimum wage for all employees increased
by 6 percent in the first half, followed by another 6 percent increase in the second half of 2010.
On May 1, 2010, the Government announced a 10 percent increase in the salaries of public
employees earning less than 5,500 cordobas a month through a "solidarity bonus.” In contrast,
labor incomes for those with higher education did not grow as much as for the less educated. By
economic sectors, the wage gap has also declined since wages have increased more in low
productivity sectors such as in primary activities (e.g., agriculture) (Figure 109).

Recent salary data reflects a decreasing returns on investment in education. For example,
preliminary estimations suggest that returns to education have decreased for all educational levels,
in particular for those with tertiary education (Figure 110). This suggests that the skills provided
by the formal education sector may not necessarily be those required by the productive sector. It
may also be a reflection of the low quality of education. Moreover, compared to other countries in
LAC, Nicaragua has the lowest returns to education for all educational levels.

Nicaragua is by far the country that spends the most resources as a share of GDP on ALMPs
in Central America. Nicaragua spends 0.5 percent of GDP on ALMPs, which amounts to
US$14.30 per capita. In real terms, this is higher than most Central American countries except for
Costa Rica, which spends US$30.30 per capita (Figure 111). The key ALMPs are Usura Cero, and
services provided by INATEC (Table 13). Most of these programs target the youth, the poor, and
entrepreneurs, and support agricultural production. Most of the spending is allocated to training
programs provided through INATEC, which account for 95 percent of total spending in ALMPs.

ALMPs have more coverage in urban areas and among the non-poor (Table 14). One of the
largest ALMPs is Usura Cero, which was created in 2007 and is targeted to families living in
extreme poverty in urban areas. It provides access to credit, in-kind transfers, and training
programs for women.73 According to data from 2014, Program coverage in urban areas reached
6.2 percent compared to 2.5 percent in rural areas, but most of the beneficiaries are non-poor.
Programa Crisol is another ALMP which provides financing to small farmers. Although it covers
only a small portion of the population, it is the best targeted program to the poor among the ALMPs
and has had tremendous impact on the rural sector, especially small producers of corn, beans, rice,
and sorghum in rural areas. The other ALMPs still have a low coverage and most of beneficia r ies
are non-poor (Figure 112).




73 In 2013, the budget of the Usura Cero program was 0.02 percent of GDP. These resources have mixed origins,
including the national treasury and external funding (donations and credits). In 2009, 27 percent of the funding
corresponded to external loans, 7% to external donations and the rest came from State sources, according to the
information provided by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit of Nicaragua.

INACTEC accounts for the largest share of spending in ALMPs, providing technical training
on a diverse array of topics to both youth and adult populations. ALMPs cover 12 percent of
the employed population, in particular from the services and trade sectors. INATEC offers a wide
range of courses of shorter duration (60 to 600 hours of classes) aimed at training employees or
underemployed adults. The demand for training courses is diverse, spanning different economic
sectors, including: services and trade; industry and construction; and agriculture- forestry. Like
other similar institutions in the region, INATEC resources come from a two percent business

payroll tax, which allows them to offer courses in 35 technical institutes across the country. In
2013, INATEC provided services to 23,271 full time students in different technical areas and
315,729 part-time courses. However, training programs for the unemployed are limited. Data for
2014 shows that only 7 percent of the unemployed had taken a training course in the last year
(Figure 113). In addition, most beneficiaries of such trainings belong to the upper consumptio n
quintiles. It should be noted that from 2007 to 2013, coverage of ALMPs has tripled.

Other labor market interventions includes low-cost labor intermediation services and
emergency jobs. The Ministry of Labor (Ministerio del Trabajo, MITRAB) has established the
Public Employment Service, whose function is the promotion of employment and self-
employment in order to support re-entry of the unemployed back into the labor market. However,
service coverage is still very limited, with just close to 3,000 unemployed having been re-
introduced into the labor market in 2014. MITRAB is extending the network of employme nt
services, offering labor information and intermediation through mesas de empleo (employme nt
offices) at municipal level, as well as timely guidance to support projects, such as entrepreneurs hip,
helping attract investment and provide technical training, among others. 74 The work for food
programs are one mechanism for promoting employment in times of emergency. These types of
programs are activated in the event of a crisis and mostly funded by international organizatio ns,
namely WFP. Together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the National Basic Food
Company, these programs have supported a large number of beneficiaries, nearly doubling
coverage from 40,785 people in 2008 to 78,030 in 2011. 75

VI.3   Institutional Arrangements

Nicaragua’s SPL system has existed for more than three decades and has adapted to the
different political administrations and their respective social policies. In the 1980s, the social
assistance and social security services were provided by one unique institution. In the early 1990s,
a series of reforms changed the institutional arrangements, resulting in the division of service
provision among a few institutions and leaving the social security services and pensions under the
INSS and the social welfare services under a newly created institution, the Nicaraguan Fund for
the Children and Family. In 1998, MIFAN was created, and since then it has been the rector of
social assistance and care services aiming for the prevention, promotion, and protection of
Nicaraguan families. Further reforms to its by-laws were introduced in 2007, adding
responsibilities for the restitution of children’s rights and changing its name to Ministry of the
Family, Children and Youth.

Since the early 2000s, there have been a number of major efforts to understand the causes of
poverty in Nicaragua and to develop policies and programs to reduce it, including the
implementation of poverty reduction strategies and reforms for the strengthening of the SPL
system. The Government enacted the NSPP in 2003, and designed the Solidarity System for
Development in 2006. During that period, the NSPP was coordinated by MIFAN. In addition, the
Government made significant investments in the development of monitoring and evaluatio n
systems. However, these adjustments did not bear the expected results, as the policy objectives
were not fully achieved and the fragmentation of programs made it difficult to have a meaningful
impact on poverty reduction during this period.

Later, in 2007, the new Administration ushered in a major shift in vision in terms of Social
Protection policy. The result was an increased focus on the restitution of rights of poor families,
centered by an overarching commitment to the common good, social equity and shared
responsibility for the development of the Nicaraguan families. To support this new approach, the
SNBS was constituted, coordinated by the Secretary of the Council of Communication and
Citizenship for Social Development (Secretaría del Consejo de Comunicación y Ciudadanía para
el Desarrollo Social). As opposed to the Red de Protección Social, which focused on providing
cash transfers to the poor, the main focus of the SNBS was to ensure and strengthen food security,
access to social services, civic integration, and social infrastructure. While Red de Protección
Social CCT was discontinued in 2007, a number of new social programs were established under
this new approach, including the previously discussed Programa Amor, Hambre Cero and Usura
Cero. These programs supported the vision to restore the rights of children and families and to
develop productive capacities among vulnerable groups, in terms of nutrition and through support
to sustainable livelihoods, respectively. Implementation of the SNBS was based on: (i) shared
responsibility of the families for their own development; (ii) a community organized network of




                                                116
                  Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


volunteers; and (iii)     inter-agency    coordination    and   operational   decentralization,   or
“municipalization.”

The institutions that comprise the SNBS are very large and heterogeneous, which adds a
level of complexity to policy planning and creates some efficiency challenges. With the creation
of the SNBS, many duplicative program were eliminated through important efforts to consolidate
interventions and align international cooperation. Similarly, many institutions have undertaken a
thorough process of reform and program revision since 2007. Still, it is clear that the SNBS
comprises a large number of institutions and that coordination efforts remain quite challenging.
Fragmentation is still a challenge and there is room to improve efficiency and coordination. The
institutions participating in the SNBS include: (i) the Secretary of the Council of Communica tio n
and Citizenship for Social Development (coordination); (ii) MIFAN; (iii) MINED; (iv) MINSA;
(v) INATEC; (vi) MITRAB; (vii) MINJUVE; (vii) the Nicaraguan Institute for Women; (viii) the
Nicaraguan Institute of Sports; (ix) the Nicaraguan Institute of Culture; (x) the Institute of Urban
and Rural Housing; (xi) the Ministry of the Interior; (xii) the National Police; (xiii) the National
Lottery; (xiv) the Ministry of Development Industry and Trade; (xv) Public Sector Rural
Agricultural; (xvi) the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; (xvii) the Ministry of Economy of the
Family, Community, Cooperatives, and Associations; (xviii) the Nicaraguan Company of Basic
Food; (xix) the National Forestry Institute; (xx) Institute of Small and Medium Enterprises; (xxi)
the Nicaraguan Institute of Cooperatives; (xxii) the Nicaraguan Tourism Institute; (xxiii) the
Secretary of the Presidency; (xxiv) the Fund for Emergency Social Investme nt; (xxv) Nicaraguan
Institute of Municipal Development; and, (xxvi) municipal authorities. Finally, the planning and
budgeting for results of the whole SNBS is still an underdeveloped area. Multi-sectoral approaches
are still planned and budgeted sector by sector, instead of in a coordinated manner supported by a
common strategy with defined objectives and multi-annual goals. This is an effort that could also
be further developed and supported by a multi-annual budgeting plan.

The SNBS involves implementation at the local level through a social network of volunteers,
which is a unique approach in Central America. In 2014, MIFAN rolled out the Family and
Community Based Social Welfare Model (“Attention Model”), which promotes inter -sectoral
coordination at the local and operational levels with other approaches implemented by other social
ministries. It includes a wide network of social promoters (4,080 in 2014), who are voluntar y
agents that act as links between the community and the service providers for the restitution of their
rights, promoting community organization and educational workshops for the promotion of family
values. In addition, they participate in different processes, including promotion campaigns,
planning and data collection activities for diagnostics and evaluations, and support for the
implementation of social programs. Other social ministries such as health and education also have
community volunteers. The added value of this social capital in the territories have not yet been
evaluated or costed.




                                                117
                  Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


The registration of actors and services, and the implementation of an associated referral -
counter referral system, represents one of the major challenges for the territorial operation
of the SNBS. The operation of a multi-sectoral system such as the SNBS necessitates a dynamic
and, at times, rapid response to the needs of the population by the participating institutions. This
requires a record of institutional actors and a database of available services and the location of
service access points, through which close inter-agency coordination and participation and
communication strategies can enable an effective system of referral and counter-referral to meet
the varied demands of the communities. To this end, a mapping of actors and opportunities of the
SNBS has been prepared by MIFAN with the assistance of the World Bank. It provides informa tio n
on social services at the department/municipal levels. Further efforts to provide regular updates
and prepare regulations of its usage are still needed.

The development of monitoring and evaluation systems and other accountability
mechanisms for the existing social protection programs are still in their early stages. Efforts
to create a monitoring and evaluation information system for the SNBS began in 2008 with the
selection of indicators, the creation of various databases, and the launch of monitoring activities.
However, instead of being results-oriented, they were mostly tracking activities and
financial/physical execution. At present, the monitoring and evaluation systems and indicators
have not yet been consolidated to track performance of the system as a whole. Institutions still
individually report progress on their respective goals, as agreed in the National Human
Development Plan. These indicators are reported in the Presidential Monitoring and Evaluatio n
System (Sistema del Gobierno de Reconciliación y Unidad Nacional, SIGRUN). The SIGRUN
has been designed to monitor key indicators across the different sectors of the public ministr ies
and decentralized agencies on a regular basis. It is limited to Governmental use (not available to
public). The monitoring and analysis to make decisions based on evidence is still an area in need
of improvement in all institutions of the SNBS, reflecting the fragmentat ion and lack of unified
legal framework to regulates the monitoring, evaluation, implementation, and accountability
mechanisms for social policies. The interoperability of systems is still not considered in these
designs. Contrary to other countries in Central America and LAC, Nicaragua has not yet developed
a unique registry of beneficiaries across implementing institutions that can allow for better
coordination of interventions and improved targeting of interventions to the poor, though efforts
have started recently under MIFAN. Making progress on these efforts is crucial, as is the updating
of the 2005 poverty map with the recent data from the 2014 EMNV. Nicaragua also trails behind
Central America and LAC in the use of impact evaluations to assess interventions, though IDB has
been supporting the evaluation of Programa Amor (results not available yet to the public) and the
World Bank is supporting process and impact evaluation of the MIFAN’s family grants
component. However, it is important to recognize that the Government has continued to imple me nt
(with support from development partners) periodic census and household surveys that allow the
tracking of coverage of the main social interventions. Government policies also reflect the need
for a unified social audit scheme, which is conceived as a pillar of participatory governance.

However, this still needs to be implemented. Certain programs, such as the ones implemented by
MIFAN, are in the process of being analyzed and efforts to systematize best practices of social
auditing and grievance mechanisms is underway, but a regulatory framework for social audit is
still not in place.

VII. Conclusion and Policy Recommendations

Nicaragua has had decent economic growth in the past decade , which has contributed to
substantial poverty reduction (the largest in Central America), as well as improvements in
human development indicators. From 2001 to 2014, Nicaragua’s gross domestic product (GDP)
growth averaged 3.4 percent, which helped poverty decline from 48 percent in 2005 to 30 percent
in 2014. Importantly, Nicaragua has made improvements over the last fifteen years across almost
all human development indicators, and at a much faster rate than regional and comparator
countries. For instance, in education, Nicaragua increased enrollment and completion rates across
all levels, almost catching up with the Central American and Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)
averages. Similar improvements were seen in most health and social protection and labor (SPL)
indicators, though challenges remain regarding improving assisted deliveries and reducing
inequality and unemployment.

Many of these positive trends in human development indicators can be associated with the
increasing fiscal efforts towards improving social sector spending. As a share of GDP, social
public spending increased by a third between 2007 and 2014, highlighting an enormous fiscal
effort (from 10 percent in 2007, compared to 13.5 percent in 2014). During this period, social
public spending increased for all sectors, though health spending accounts for the largest share. As
of 2014, social spending in Nicaragua is almost at the Central America average of 13.9 percent,
though it is still among the lowest in the LAC region in per capita terms.

Fiscal accounts have deteriorated recently, which may pose some challenges to the
sustainability of current levels of financing for social sector expenditures. While the overall
fiscal situation in Nicaragua is better than most Central American countries, the consolidated
public sector deficit widened to 2 percent in 2014 after grants (and estimated at 2.7 percent of GDP
in 2015). This was largely due to a decline in loans provided to the private sector in concessional
terms originating from the oil subsidies from Venezuela and the recent deterioration in the fiscal
balance of state-owned enterprises. The deterioration of fiscal accounts will likely limit the
possibilities for further increases in social sector spending, and may require cuts in order to ensure
fiscal sustainability in the coming years.

Better planning and monitoring of social spending are needed to improve Nicaragua’s
budget management. While Nicaragua has a medium-term development plan, the use of results-
oriented budget formulation is still in its early stages. There is space to improve and expand current
efforts of planning and budgeting for results beyond a few ministries (health and education) to all
social sectors. Greater transparency in budget execution would allow room for more efficient
spending , as historically, only approved budgets are made available to policymakers and the
public, as opposed to information on the use of funds and results achieved. While information on



                                                 120
                   Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


annual budget execution for capital expenses can be easily tracked, tracking of recurrent
expenditures is extremely difficult.

VII.1 Education

Despite several results in improving access, internal efficiency, and attainment in primary
education, some internal inefficiencies in the education system (reflected in repetition and
overage students) and overall still low investment in basic education have limited the capacity
to produce better educational outcomes. Policies implemented since 2008 have contributed to
improving access to and retention in primary education, as well as to increasing educational
attainment of the population as a whole. However, the volume and distribution of education
spending, which is still highly regressive at post-secondary levels, somewhat limits the ability to
use education expenditures as a mechanism to promote shared prosperity. Moving ahead, a number
of important challenges remain, namely: (i) reducing both late entry into the basic education
system and repetition/dropouts in grades 1 through 9; (ii) improving the quality of learning
outcomes across the board, which remain quite low (despite being the most equitably distributed
in Central America); and, (iii) making upper secondary education sufficiently attractive to
teenagers in rural areas, partly through improving relevance and the restructuring of the
curriculum. The improvement of teacher quality is also central to improving the quality of the
entire educational system. In this respect, the lack of adequate selection mechanisms, the
limitations to providing quality teacher training, and the lack of incentives for the best qualified
teachers represent obstacles that need to be removed. Finally, weak coordination across differe nt
actors, a highly centralized system and low accountability are also affecting the quality of the
system as a whole. For example, the numerous changes made by the current Government to the
education system since 2008 have yet to be legally formalized or brought together under a single,
inclusive education sector strategy with a single information, monitoring and evaluatio n
mechanism.

Strengthening some of the measures already in place to improve basic education completion
and learning outcomes, while also adopting a more comprehensive results focused strategy,
would likely have a significant impact. In the short term, in order to reduce the number of
dropouts, there could be an explicit focus on reducing late-entry into first grade and removing
obstacles that hinder continuity throughout basic education. First, this implies continuing the
implementation of the Quality Model for Preschool Education, with an emphasis on improving
teacher training, as well as preschool infrastructure and facilities in rural areas, particularly on the
Caribbean Coast. Second, a review of the progress made should be undertaken and, thereafter,
efforts to implement the First and Second Grade Strategy should be evaluated and ultima te ly
strengthened with other policies nationwide in order to reduce dropouts early in the basic education
cycle (first and second grades). Third, learning conditions in multi- grade schools (located mostly
in rural areas) should continue to be improved, including teacher training, improving school


                                                  121
                  Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


infrastructure, and using adapted learning instruments. Fourth, at the upper-secondary level, it is
also important to strengthen diagnostics on the causes of drop out, as well as to develop a
comprehensive strategy to make secondary education more attractive for adolescents. Among
other things, this could include new pedagogies, such as use of mentoring and/or a more modern
and relevant curriculum (with selected contents adapted to rural areas). Finally, there are clear
needs for new budget allocations to improve the quality of school infrastructure, including both
the construction of new schools and/or improved infrastructure within existing schools in rural
areas, with a particular emphasis on secondary schools.

In the medium term, the basic education curriculum should be revised in order to consolidate
the articulation of several ad hoc programs and initiatives that have already been adapte d
by the Government. Such strategies already under implementation include stressing English as a
second language, promoting the use of new technologies, improving education quality (such as
through the Quality Model for Preschool Education, the First and Second Grade Strategy, the
Multi-grade Strategy, Secondary Distance Education for Rural Areas ( Educación Secundaria a
Distancia en el Campo), and ensuring continuity and proper coordination among education levels.
In addition, an improved approach that blends general and technical content would likely increase
the relevance of learning for the labor market and reduce the opportunity cost of attending upper
secondary education.

Reforms in teacher policies could also support the selection of the best candidates, better
equip and incentivize the best performing teachers, and motivate high performance across
the entire system. In order to achieve this, several actions are needed. In the short term, it will be
important to assess the main challenges facing teachers to manage classrooms and foster learning
through in-service observations and evaluations, reaching out to trainers in the teacher training
centers, and conducting classroom observation studies/surveys. Second, it will be important to
carry out a national review of both the curriculum for pre-service teacher training for basic
education, as well as the institutional framework for teacher training. Finally, there is a need to
gradually develop and formalize the hiring of community preschool teachers ( educadoras
comunitarias) if and when they are officially certified; when accompanied by adequate skills and
qualifications, increased pay will likely incentivize better performance and accountability.

In the medium term, it will be important to improve incentives (financial and non-financ ial)
for teacher career development based on merit, which could be primarily based on in-
classroom teacher performance and student learning outcomes. Additionally it will be key to
promote the regular use of student learning assessments to improve teacher quality. With regard
to teacher selection, it will be important to improve this process by increasing the selectivity for
entry to teacher education programs, as well as being more selective in hiring top quality teachers.
These efforts should be supported through a combination of financial aid policies with measures
to overcome non-financial obstacles of the most vulnerable in order to reduce the opportunity cost

of participating in teacher training. Most importantly, there are also important reforms needed in
the basic education teacher training schools (escuelas normales). For example, there is a need to
improve curriculum, pedagogies, and infrastructure, as well as increase the availability of
scholarships for top performing students. To improve secondary teacher quality, the CNU could:
(i) increase the resources allocated to teacher training by education faculties (from its autonomous
budget); and, (ii) open new courses in selected regions and/or give scholarship to outstanding
secondary teachers to complete their graduate degree in education.

Finally, a revision of the current legal, institutional, and managerial framework would
facilitate better and more informed decision-making and ultimately improve accountability
within the system. Several actions would be needed. Over the short term, it would be important
to carry out a national assessment of the main issues and challenges facing the performance of the
education system. It would also be important to address the possibility of moving towards a more
decentralized management of certain areas (school infrastructure management, planning,
monitoring and evaluation, information management, etc.) to MINED’s departmental and
municipal delegations. Over the medium term, a major challenge of the reform process will be the
need to review the education legal framework in order to formally incorporate current policies and
programs. Finally, strengthening of the education system should be accompanied by improveme nts
in access to public information that allows for all interested actors to make better informed and
planned decisions. Further investments in basic education in the Caribbean Coast can also be
promoted by developing more financing mechanisms for the Education Secretariats of the
Autonomous Regional Governments.

VII.2 Health

As noted in the health chapter, though Nicaragua’s public spending on health has increased
recently, it still remains low relative to other countries, as well as in per capita terms. There
is a distinct need to improve the efficiency of health spending, particularly in light of current fiscal
constraints. For example, MINSA could improve the use of budget allocations based on results
achieved at the main hospitals and reference hospitals in the country.

At the same time, the health sector could also benefit from additional resources in order to
further expand service coverage and quality. In this regard, the Government could consider: (i)
introducing new public policies to generate revenues for the health sector, such as taxation of
sweetened drinks, and reviewing and strengthening the implementation of existing policies, suc h
as the tobacco tax; and (ii) improving public spending efficiency in the health sector by promoting
greater inter-institutional coordination between MINSA and INSS. In addition, MINSA could
improve the use of budget allocations based on results achieved at the main hospitals and reference
hospitals in the country.




                                                  123
                       Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


The relatively balanced spending on hospitals and primary care programs, coupled with the
strong leadership of MINSA has contributed to improvements in outcomes, but challenges
remain. Some improvements include the decrease in child and maternal mortality rates and
chronic malnutrition and the increase in overall life expectancy. However, challenges remain in
closing coverage gaps with regard to certain outcomes. For example, Nicaragua needs to continue
to address maternal mortality and the increasing threat of NCDs. While shares of out of pocket
spending have decreased overall, the Government should continue to work towards reducing
disparities in access to, quality of, and cost of services between urban and rural areas and across
income quintiles.

While progress has been made in ensuring strong institutional management and governance
of critical interventions, quality remains a challenge. To date, MINSA has demonstrated the
ability to successfully deliver critical health services rooted firmly at the community level through
the implementation of the MOSAFC. However, despite such achievements, a few aspects related
to quality of care continue to present challenges. In this context, there is a need to: (i) perform
systematic reviews of health results to ensure the effectiveness of the health care system and good
functioning of the health network; (ii) improve efficiency by ensuring the optimal use of available
resources to yield maximum benefits or results; and (iii) ensure that the health system is
sufficiently responsive in both modality and type of service delivery to adequately serve people
with different needs and/or cultural beliefs.

Multi-sectoral efforts and policy changes are also needed to address some existing health
sector challenges. Such efforts require a high level mandate, 76 strategies, and sufficient budgets
to implement. For example, first the inter-sectoral collaboration between MINED, MIFAN and
MINJUVE through the implementation of the ENSDIA would need to include the development of
integrated programs to prevent and address the effects of adolescent pregnancy. Second, the health
sector has invested heavily in assessing and managing hospital waste in Managua’s hospitals,
which also fostered a dialogue about non-hazardous waste management and the disposal of
hazardous waste. However, more action on the part of municipalities and MARENA is needed to
ensure the proper management of hazardous waste, particularly in public disposal places with a
high potential for population exposure. Third, the health sector could take a leadership role in
strengthening and incentivizing a multi-sectoral response to chronic diseases and trauma. While it
need to continue to proactively address these challenges through health-specific interventio ns,
interventions from other sectors would be essential to effectively implement public policies that
address NCD and trauma/violence related risk factors.

Moving forward, the Government could take into consideration the following short-run
recommendations for the health sector: (i) evaluate the 10 year implementation experience of


76   Ministerial Agreements


                                                   124

MOSAFC, particularly with regard to the functioning of the health care network and quality of
care; (ii) strengthen MINSA’s capacity to regulate the drug supply chain and access to drugs, and
improve drug availability, particularly at the primary care level; (iii) include a budget line in
MINSA for the maintenance, prevention and repair of medical and non-medical equipment; and,
(iv) introduce new public policies to generate revenues for the health sector, such as taxation of
sweetened drinks, and review and strengthen the implementation of existing policies, such as the
tobacco tax.

In the medium to long-term, the Government could consider the following : (i) develop, cost,
and implement a coordinated strategy to improve provision of preventive and curative services for
chronic diseases and trauma cases in all municipalities, led by MINSA; (ii) prepare and imple me nt
a master plan to strengthen pharmaceutical management and develop an integrated public policy
on medicines; (iii) improve inter-institutional coordination between MINSA and INSS, includ ing
integrating prevention and promotion practices put in place by MINSA into the INSS and
reviewing cross subsidies perceived by the provisional institutions working for INSS; and (iv)
MINSA could improve the use of results based budgeting allocations to the main hospitals and
reference hospitals in the country.



VII.3 Social Protection and Labor

Though spending in social protection and labor has increased in recent years, Nicaragua still
trails other countries in Central America and LAC. Recent increases in social security spending
are largely due to the launch of the reduced proportional age pension, while other increases social
assistance came in the form of subsidies. However, compared to other countries in Central
America, Nicaragua’s SPL spending in social assistance is the lowest. This is partly explained by
the lack of explicit budget allocation to SNBS and the fact that Nicaragua does not allocate
resources to cash transfer programs. However, it does spends the most in ALMPs in Central
America.

While social security coverage has increased, Nicaragua is still one of the countries with the
lowest contributions to the social security system in LAC and sustainability issues remain.
The share of employees contributing to the social security system has increased since 2001, but
remains very low compared to other countries in LAC. In 2014, the Government undertook a
reform of the pay-as-you-go pension system to address fiscal sustainability issues, but it failed to
deliver results due to policy changes. As noted in the SPL chapter, the INSS is projected to start
running persistent deficits by 2017, and the reserve fund is expected to be depleted by 2024. In
this context, it is critical to undertake measures to both work to guarantee sustainability of the
pension system, and to extend coverage to currently excluded populations, such as the poor.




                                                125
                       Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review


In addition to social security, social assistance has also expanded through subsidies and social
care programs. Moving forward, it is critical to understand their cost-effectiveness and impact of
such programs. In recent years, Nicaragua has expanded the coverage of social assistance and
social care services, through flagship programs such as Merienda Escolar, Mochila Escolar, and
Programa Amor. In general, these programs have decent coverage in rural areas, among extreme
poor, and among those in the lowest quintile. However, targeting accuracy could be improved, as
around 50 percent of social assistance beneficiaries do not belong to the poorest two quintiles of
the consumption distribution due to the universal nature of many of these flagship programs. In
addition, while preliminary results suggest that these programs have had an impact on poverty
among beneficiaries, no proper cost-benefit analysis or impact evaluation has been carried out,
making it is difficult to ascertain the true level of impact or understand opportunities for
improvements. Improving effectiveness of social assistance and social care interventions calls for
investing in monitoring and evaluation. For instance, it would be important to complete the impact
evaluation assessment of Programa Amor soon in order document achievements and inform
potential adjustments.

In contrast to the majority of countries in the region, Nicaragua does not currently have a
national cash transfer program. However, lessons from highly impactful Red de Protección
Social could be broadly incorporated into the design of future social protection policies. In
addition, having strengthened supply-side challenges related to provision of basic services, it may
be a good time to reconsider transforming some untargeted/regressive subsidies into social cash
transfer interventions and adapting ALMPs and employability strategies to explicitly target the
poorest.

With respect to the relatively high unemployment rate, Nicaragua has made important
efforts into expanding ALMPs. Nicaragua spends more than any other country in Central
America on ALMPs, including Usura Cero, which provides access to credit, in-kind transfers, and
training programs for women, and services provided by INATEC. Most of these programs target
the youth (who are prone to high unemployment) and those typically employed in the infor ma l
sector or self-employed,77 or support agricultural production.

Efforts to improving appropriateness, financing sources, and targeting of ALMPs are critical
moving forward. In reality, few of the vulnerable groups benefit from these interventions, which
highlights the need for an explicit and dedicated focus on reaching vulnerable groups. For example,
Nicaragua could consider combining provision of training and cash transfers with and
entrepreneurship promotions into a “poverty- graduation” approach. Organizations such as BRAC
have shown success in using this type of approach to help populations transition out of extreme
poverty (Banerjee et al, 2015).

                   Nicaragua Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review



Since the early 2000s, there have been a number of policy shifts and vision in SPL policy in
Nicaragua. In 2007, the Ortega Administration shifted the focus of SPL policies on restoring
rights to poor families, with a focus on social equity and shared responsibility for development.
To support these efforts, the SNBS was constituted, with the coordination of the Secretary of the
Council of Communication and Citizenship for Social Development ( Secretaría del Consejo de
Comunicación y Ciudadanía para el Desarrollo Social) and the participation of all ministr ies
working in social development and welfare programs. However, despite a clear vision, the plethora
of institutions comprising the SNBS are both large and heterogeneous, resulting in challenges of
fragmentation and potentially hampering policy planning and efficient program implementatio n.
In this context, there is a need for a revision of the operating framework and the development of
mechanisms to improve implementation of the SNBS, possibly including the consolidation of
interventions under fewer implementing agencies.

Efforts to improve coordination at local level should also be strengthened. Finalizing and
digitalizing the mapping of actors within the sector could help improve coordination. The
operation of a multi-sectoral system, such as the SNBS, necessitates a high level of dynamism and
the ability to quickly response to the needs of the population. This requires, among other things,
of a record of institutional actors (with their location and inventory of available services). Build ing
from this, close inter-agency coordination, participation, and communication strategies, could
enable an effective system of referral and cross-referral to meet the different demands of the
community. To this end, current efforts underway at MIFAN could be completed and piloted in
other line ministries. In addition, and to maximize the impact of the programs of the SNBS, it
would be important to prioritize care in communities with the highest incidence of extreme
poverty, the highest exposure to natural disasters, and unmet basic needs (in both rural and urban
areas). Finally, the multi-sectoral approach for the integral delivery of services to selected
population (such as children, youth or the elderly) should be systematized and developed further.

Finally, more needs to be done to improve monitoring and evaluation and accountability
mechanisms of social protection programs. Monitoring efforts and use of analysis to make
decisions based on statistics is still lacking, highlighting an important area of focus to improve
quality and efficiency in the decision making process. In contrast to other countries in Central
America and LAC, Nicaragua has not yet developed a unique registry of beneficiaries across
implementing institutions that can allow better coordination of interventions and strengthen the
focus on the poor. However, MIFAN is leading efforts to expand such a registry beyond its own
projects to include those of other line ministries. Finalizing this effort will be critical, as will
updating the 2005 poverty map with the data from the recent EMNV 2014. Finally, Governme nt
policies also reflect the need for improved controls and implement social audit, which are
considered a pillar of participatory governance. However this still needs to be implemented on a
broader scale and publicly disseminated.

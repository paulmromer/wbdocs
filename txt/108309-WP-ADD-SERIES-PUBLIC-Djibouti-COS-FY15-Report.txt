I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Djibouti perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Djibouti
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Djibouti
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From February to May 2015, 304 stakeholders of the WBG in Djibouti were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors working
on WBG-supported projects/programs; PMUs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies;
private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs/community based organizations (CBO); the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 191 stakeholders participated in the survey
(63% response rate).

Some respondents filled out the questionnaire with a representative of the fielding agency in
person, and others received and returned the questionnaires via email or courier. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Djibouti; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in Djibouti; and the WBG’s communication and information
sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s country survey were compared to those in the country survey conducted
in FY’12 (response rate is 54%, N=118). Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder
composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups which were
not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged
to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of the FY’ 15
data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those of the
original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, F, and G. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 98).

         office of a minister were combined. Respondents from ministries/ministerial
         departments/implementation agencies, PMUs, and consultants working on WBG projects
         also were combined; respondents from NGOs/CBOs, trade unions, faith-based groups,
         and youth groups were combined in the “CSO? category. Respondents from private
         sector organization and financial sector/private banks were combined. Few respondents
         from the media, independent government institutions, and the judiciary branch were
         included in the “Other? category. There were no respondents from the private

Familiarity with the World Bank Group

        survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’15 = 5.84; weighted mean in FY’12 = 5.77)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, moderately
        correlated with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Djibouti, the
        WBG’s perceived relevance to Djibouti’s development, and the WBG’s help with
        achieving the country’s development results.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Djibouti, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-nines specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Djibouti.
       The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at communicable/non-communicable diseases;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster management; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Djibouti, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice (e.g., judicial system);
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at anti corruption.

Appendix E: Responses to Comparable Questions by Year22
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2015 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.

 FY ’12 Number of comparable respondents = 105                         FY ’15 Number of comparable respondents = 176

By weighting, FY 2012 and FY 2015 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past

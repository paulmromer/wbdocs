                                            INTRODUCTION
1. National poverty rates are traditionally measured using survey data. To allow for frequent monitoring
and to contain the costs of gathering detailed information, such surveys sample only a small subset of the
population. When this sample of the population is representative, welfare surveys provide reliable estimates
of poverty incidence for the entire population at a small fraction of the cost that would be required to survey
each person in the country.

2. This approach necessarily leads to sampling errors however, and as a consequence, a typical household
income or expenditure survey cannot produce statistically reliable poverty estimates for small geographic
units. In the Republic of Tajikistan, the standard official poverty rates are not produced below the oblast
level for this reason.

3. This report discusses two means of addressing the issue. The first is commonly referred to as â€œpoverty
mappingâ€, and derives estimates of monetary poverty as it was officially measured in Tajikistan at the time
of the surveys used in the analysis. The second is a multi-dimensional poverty index (MPI) that combines
information about individual deprivations to summarize a complimentary, but unofficial, measure of
poverty incidence.

4. Poverty mapping is a powerful approach to measuring welfare for highly disaggregated geographic
units. Using the techniques of multiple imputation, poverty mapping efforts are undertaken to estimate
poverty for small areas; indicators that would be impossible to construct with traditional survey data alone.
The results are often used to target policies and assign resources to have greater poverty-reducing impact.
Globally, poverty maps have been used to highlight geographic variations, simultaneously display different
dimensions of poverty, understand poverty determinants, and to both design and select interventions.

5. A variety of poverty mapping methods have been devised to overcome the increasing imprecision of
poverty estimates as they are disaggregated. The standard approach, used in most cases when sufficient
data are available, is described in Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw (2003, henceforth ELL) and elaborated in
Bedi, Coudouel, and Simler (2007). The ELL method is used for the official map described in this report.

6. The ELL approach to generating small area estimates (SAE) leverages the strengths of two data
sources. First, the method makes use of traditional survey data that include detailed information on
consumption and wellbeing. Second, the method employs individual or household-level information from
the national Census. While censuses usually provide less detail than surveys for any individual or
household, the main advantage of using census data is that they provide complete coverage of the entire
population, and are therefore free of sampling error.

7.   The standard strategy for estimating a poverty map involves three main stages:

     a. First, identify a comparable set of variables that appear in both the census and the household survey;
     b. Second, estimate consumption as a function of the comparable set of variables; and
     c. Finally, compute welfare indicators on census records based on the parameters derived from the
        estimations carried out on data from the household survey.

8. For Tajikistan, the estimation procedure uses: (i) the Tajikistan Living Standards Measurement Survey
(TLSS) conducted in 2009, and (ii) the Population and Housing Census (2010). The poverty map described

                                                      3
below reports poverty estimates at the rayon level. All 58 rayons of the Republic of Tajikistan are included,
and because some urban areas hold similar status to rayons in Tajikistan, several cities for which data was
collected in the TLSS survey were also included in the mapping exercise. Dushanbe itself is divided into 4
rayons, but for the purposes of the estimation, the city was treated as a single unit.

9. The second approach to investigating welfare for small areas described below is a highly disaggregated
MPI measure. This indicator is intended to compliment the imputed monetary measure, and help to identify
concentrations of deprivation. There are several advantages to using an MPI. Depending on the specific
indicators included, they are often relatively easy to collect, and in some cases can be less prone to
measurement error. But perhaps the most important advantage in this context is that because all of the
indicators needed to estimate the MPI were present in the 2010 national Census of Tajikistan, no imputation
is required.

10. However, MPI estimates have some drawbacks as well. Countries define MPI indicators in many
different ways, but unlike monetary measures, such indexes are not always directly comparable. This is due
in part to simple differences in definition, but also because there are often differences in the importance of
deprivations from one country or context to the next. Data availability issues also commonly discourage
the use of multidimensional indexes in practice. The MPI indicators reported below add significant detail
about the lived experience and the acuteness of poverty, but should be viewed as complimentary to
monetary indicators, rather than a replacement for them.

                                   METHOD, DATA, AND MODELING


      MONETARY IMPUTATION METHOD

1.1     Because numerous methods are available, selecting an appropriate method is a critical first step in
deriving a poverty map. An SAE method developed by Elbers et al. (2003) has gained wide popularity
among development practitioners, and is preferred within the World Bank when sufficient data are
available.

1.2     The poverty map described in this report relies on the ELL approach on the basis of household-
level data from the Population Census and the 2009 Tajikistan Living Standards Measurement Survey
(TLSS). The ELL model utilizes detailed income/consumption information from a household survey, such
as the TLSS, to estimate a model of monetary welfare, given a set of observable household characteristics.
The parameter estimates from the model are then applied to the same set of characteristics in the population
census to impute monetary welfare.

1.3       As a consequence of computing poverty incidence based on imputed consumption, SAE estimates
of poverty are also subject to imputation error. One advantage of the ELL method over similar approaches
is that it not only allows estimation of poverty incidence, but also the relevant standard errors. Elbers et al.
(2003) analyze the properties of these errors in detail (the section below provides greater detail on the
method). Experience to date suggests that poverty estimates are in most cases sufficiently precise for the
purposes of informing policy choices (Bedi, Coudouel, and Simler, 2007; World Bank, 2012b).

1.4     Formally, the ELL model can be estimated as the (log) of per capita household consumption:

                                           í µí±¦í µí±â„Ž = í µí±‹â€²í µí±â„Ž í µí»½ + í µí±¢í µí±â„Ž

where í µí±¦í µí±â„Ž is the per capita consumption of household h residing in area c, í µí±‹í µí±â„Ž are household and
area/location characteristics, and í µí±¢í µí±â„Ž = í µí¼‡í µí± + í µí¼€í µí±â„Ž , representing the residual, which is composed of the area
component í µí¼‡í µí± and the household component í µí¼€í µí±â„Ž . These two residual components have expected values of
                                                                           2)       2      2
zero, and are independent of each other. It is assumed that í µí°¸(í µí±¢í µí±            = í µí¼Ží µí¼‡ + í µí¼Ží µí¼€ . To estimate variance
parameters, the following results rely on Henderson's method III, a commonly used estimator for the
variance parameters of a nested error model (see Henderson, 1953; and Searle et al., 1992).

1.5     The variance of the remaining residual í µí¼€í µí±â„Ž is modeled via a logistic transformation as a function
                                                  2
                                                í µí±’í µí±â„Ž
of household and area characteristics í µí±™í µí±› [         2    ] = í µí±â€²í µí±â„Ž í µí»¼ + í µí±Ÿí µí±â„Ž in order to obtain an estimate of the
                                               í µí°´âˆ’í µí±’í µí±â„Ž
            2
         í µí¼Ží µí¼€,í µí±â„Ž
variance Ì‚        . Note that this approach allows for heteroscedasticity, such that the model is subsequently
re-estimated to get a GLS estimate of í µí»½ and of the variance-covariance matrix.

1.6      The small area estimates (and their standard errors) are obtained by means of simulation, which is
ideally suited for estimating quantities that are non-linear functions of y (and thus non-linear function of

the errors and the model parameters), such as measures of poverty and inequality. Let R denote the number
of simulations. The estimator then takes the form:

                                                Ì‚ = 1 âˆ‘í µí±…

where â„Ž(í µí±¦) is a function that converts the vector y with (log) incomes for all households into a poverty
                                                  Ìƒ í µí±Ÿ denotes the r-th simulated vector with elements:

                                              Ìƒ í µí±Ÿ = í µí±‹ â€² í µí»½        í µí±Ÿ

                                                                       + í µí¼€Ìƒí µí±â„Ž

                                                                                 Ìƒí µí±         í µí±Ÿ
                                                                                      and í µí¼€Ìƒí µí±â„Ž are drawn from
                                               Ìƒ í µí±Ÿ
their estimated distributions. The parameters í µí»½ are drawn by re-estimating the model parameters using the
                                                             Ìƒí µí±Ÿ may be drawn from its estimated asymptotic
r-th bootstrap version of the survey sample. Alternatively, í µí»½
distribution (called â€œparametric drawingâ€). The advantage of parametric drawing is that it is
computationally fast. A potential disadvantage is that the true distribution of the estimator for the model
parameter vector does not necessarily coincide with the asymptotic distribution. The use of bootstrapping,
albeit more computationally intensive, provides a means of identifying the finite-sample distribution, and
is thus expected to provide more accurate results when the sample size is small. The sample size of the
TLSS used in this case is large enough for the asymptotic results to apply, and there is therefore little to no
expected difference between estimates obtained with parametric drawing and bootstrapping.

1.8      A further alternative at this stage is to employ Empirical Best (EB) estimation. The idea of EB
estimation is that the residuals for households sampled in area c, í µí±’í µí±â„Ž = í µí±¦í µí±â„Ž âˆ’ í µí±‹â€²í µí±â„Ž í µí»½, are informative of
the latent area error í µí¼‡í µí± . This means that conditioning on the residuals observed for sampled households
should enable tightening the distributions from which í µí¼‡í µí± is simulated. It should be noted that EB only
concerns the drawing of the area errors, and only areas that have been sampled in the TLSS benefit from
the improvement offered by EB; for areas not sampled in the survey we still draw from the unconditional
distribution, in which case EB we will refer to it as ELL-EB) coincides with standard ELL.

1.9     Any of these options yields R simulated poverty rates. The point estimates and their corresponding
standard errors are obtained by computing respectively the average and the standard deviation over these
simulated values. Box 1.1 below provides greater detail on this method.

 Box 1.1: Step-by-step Summary of the Modelling Approach

 1. Bootstrap the survey (unless parametric drawing of the model parameters is used).

 2. Estimate í µí»½ by means of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and extract the residuals.

                                                                                 2        2
 3. Estimate the unconditional variance parameters of the nested error model (í µí¼Ží µí¼‡ and í µí¼Ží µí¼€ ) by applying
 Henderson-method-III (see Henderson, 1953).

 4. If heteroskedastic household errors are assumed, then: (a) derive estimates of the household errors by
 subtracting the area averages from the residuals (i.e. deviations from the area mean residual), (b) apply
 a logistic transformation to the errors derived under (a) to obtain the left-hand side (LFS) of the
 regression (also referred to as the â€œalpha-modelâ€) that will be used to predict the conditional variance of

 8. With the simulated household income data, the poverty and inequality measures can now be computed
 as if the population census came with household income data from the start.

 9. This yields a simulated poverty and inequality measure for each of the R simulation rounds. The
 average and standard deviation give the poverty point estimate and the corresponding standard error
 respectively.



        MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY METHOD

1.10    A Multidimensional poverty index (MPI) is a common non-monetary compliment to monetary
poverty estimates. In the case of Tajikistan, sufficient information is collected in the Census to derive such
a measure without using any imputation approaches. For most such non-monetary measures, â€œdeprivationsâ€
or â€œvulnerabilitiesâ€ are identified, and summarized in the form of an index.

1.11     There are several strengths to this method:

    ï‚·    Firstly, it is easy to reproduce and to estimate, and does not require sophisticated econometrics or
         programming.


                                                         15
    ï‚·    A second benefit is that the measure does not require substantial data collection efforts. A relatively
         small module could be added to a survey for the purposes of estimating the index.

    ï‚·    Non-monetary approaches are also more straightforward to estimate when information on inflation
         is unavailable or unreliable

1.12     But there are also drawbacks:

    ï‚·    In Tajikistan, poverty is officially monitored using a monetary measure of consumption. This
         implies that a non-monetary measure would not necessarily coincide with official measures of
         poverty in the country.

    ï‚·    MPI indicators are not always comparable across regions or countries, due to the nature of the
         deprivations included. For instance, lacking access to heating is fundamentally incomparable
         between a county with a tropical climate and a country with a continental one.

1.13     The variables used to create the MPI reported below are grouped by three dimensions: i)
demographic and labor, ii) education, and iii) services and infrastructure. Each dimension is equally
weighted, and within each dimension, each indicator is also equally weighted. A household is defined as
multi-dimensionally poor when the household is deprived on 33 percent or more of the weighted indicators
in the index. In addition, severe poverty is defined as a household which is deprived on 50 percent or more
of the weighted indicators in the index. A household is â€œvulnerableâ€ for multidimensional poverty when
deprived on at least 20 percent, but less than 33 percent of weighted indicators in the index.

1.14    For Tajikistan, the dimensions and indicators were informed by deprivation index analysis across
countries and by Azevedo, Rajabov et al. (2015), and include:

    ï‚·    Education
            o Households with individuals (18+) who cannot read or write
            o At least one individual (20+) who has not completed secondary school
            o No household member has completed tertiary education

    ï‚·    Demographic and Labor
            o Dependency ratio>1
            o Both household heads are not employed

    ï‚·    Services and infrastructure
             o No access to sewage system
             o No access to piped water
             o Heating from oven, or heating is absent
             o No garbage disposal system
             o No toilet inside the house

        DATA

1.15    The data for the monetary poverty map come from two sources: the Tajikistan Living Standard
Measurement Survey 2009 (TLSS) collected by the State Statistical Agency of Tajikistan in collaboration
with the World Bank, and the 2010 Census of Tajikistan.



                                                      16
1.16     An alternative data source, the household budget survey (HBS), was also available for estimating
the poverty map. After thorough evaluation however, the HBS was not selected. Though the HBS has a
number of advantages over the TLSS (including larger sample size, and the fact that it is currently the
official source of poverty statistics for the country), the specific requirements of the poverty mapping
method employed resulted in unstable results. More specifically, an HBS-based version of the model
yielded an accurate prediction for the whole of Tajikistan when used for imputation, but the model could
not capture the heterogeneity across oblasts reflected by poor oblast level predictions compared to direct
estimates from TLSS. It was therefore decided that the TLSS was the preferred poverty data source for this
undertaking, in light of the surveyâ€™s timing and greater geographic coverage.

1.17    The TLSS provides information on food and non-food expenditure, labor activities, migration,
agriculture, education, dwelling, utilities, and durable goods. The sample is representative at the national
and regional level (Sugd, RRS, Khatlon, GBAO, plus Dushanbe) and for urban and rural strata. The survey
was designed as a panel of 1,500 households interviewed during the Tajikistan 2007 Living Standards
Survey (TLSS07). The households were revisited in November 2009, during the same time of year in which
they were visited originally in 2007.

1.18     The original TLSS07 sampling design followed the enumeration areas defined for the census. The
survey was stratified by region, and by urban and rural location of residence (9 strata: 4 rural, 5 urban). The
sampling was designed in two stages. In the first stage, sampling units representing clusters were selected.
In the second stage, a random sample of households was drawn from each clusters using the official clusters
household book (a register maintained by officials in the enumeration area).

1.19     The Census of Tajikistan covers approximately 1.6 million households and 8 million individuals.
The Republic of Tajikistan is administratively divided in 4 regions: Sogd oblast, Khatlon oblast, Gorno-
Badagakashan (GBAO), Direct Rule District commonly known as the RRS (or the Regional Republics of
Subordination, in which there are 13 autonomous districts) and Dushanbe. There are a total of 58 rayon
(districts), 4 districts of Dushanbe, and 17 cities subordinated either to the Republic or to the oblast. There
are 356 jamoats (rural administrative areas) and 13 towns of rural type. For the estimates that follow, the
entire census database was available.

1.20    While most of the population in Tajikistan is located in the west of the country, districts in the east
are generally less densely populated. Figure 1.1 described the population density of Tajikistan according to
the 2010 Census.

      MODELLING FOR MONETARY POVERTY

1.21     Since the ELL approach relies on estimating a welfare model on the TLSS data and applying it to
the Population and Housing Census data, one of the key requirements of the model building stage is the
similarity between the variables in the TLSS and the census. As part of building a welfare model, a two-
stage process was undertaken:

        a. Step 1: comparison of the TLSS and census questionnaires to identify â€œcandidate variablesâ€
           that exist both in the survey and the census and that are generated from identical or similar
           questions;

        b. Step 2: comparison of the distributions of the â€œcandidate variablesâ€ identified in step 1 in order
           to examine whether they capture the same underlying phenomena or whether, despite similar
           questions, their empirical distributions differ in any important ways.

1.22     The goal of model construction is to explain the variation in per capita household expenditure. The
choice of candidate variables is typically constrained by the overlap between the survey and census
questionnaires, and based on a heuristic model of household expenditure. Expenditure is often assumed to
be a function of the demographic characteristics of the household (e.g. small children, working-age adults,
or elderly), and individual education and occupation characteristics of the household and its members (e.g.


                                                    18
maximum level of education in the household, education level, the employment status of household
members, and the type of employment for those who are employed).

1.23     In addition, other indicators such as the type of dwelling a household resides in, or the types of
assets the household possesses (e.g. whether or not there is a bath or toilet in the dwelling), commonly
proxy for variation in other welfare measurements. Accesses to basic services such as water and electricity
are also assumed to reflect the income level and/or expenditure of the household. Household expenditure
may also vary based on the location of the household (e.g. rural vs. urban; proximity to big cities; area with
low or high employment rates etc.).

1.24    In Tajikistan, the pool of variables common to the two questionnaires included:

    a. Demographic characteristics: Gender, age, marital status, household size, number of children,
       adults, and elderly in the household, dependency ratio
    b. Education: Education level of the household head, highest level of education by any household
       member
    c. Occupation: Employment status, occupation, sector of employment
    d. Housing characteristics: Type of housing unit, main construction material of wall, total area of
       land and dwelling, ownership and occupancy status of dwelling, source of drinking water and
       electricity, type of sewage and toilet
    e. Productive and durable assets: Ownership of cooler, refrigerator, freezer, electrical generator,
       cooker, television, washing machine, dishwasher, water heater, heater, electric fan, air conditioner,
       vacuum cleaner, motorcycle, car, and PC.

1.25    Some of the candidate variables were defined by taking the district-level average from the census,
and including these indicators to generate more precise survey-based estimates. By construction, these
variables are identical in the census and survey micro-data. Other spatial variables include a dummy
variable for rural location and a dummy variable for the RRP oblast.1

1.26     The level at which regression models are run must be chosen carefully. If a single model is specified
for the entire country, the implicit assumption is that the parameter estimates for the explanatory variables
included in the model are the same for all regions of the country. In other words, a national model assumes
that the relationship between household expenditure and household characteristics are uniform throughout
the country. This may not be a tenable assumption in a country like Tajikistan, with wide spatial
heterogeneity. For example, returns to education are likely higher in Dushanbe where formal job market is
more robust than in the poorest areas with thin labor markets.

1.27    The approach employed for Tajikistan proceeded in a top-down fashion to decide the level at which
to model the relationship. However, as the sample size must be no smaller than 300 for each regression to
avoid the problem of over-fitting (Ahmed, Dorji, Takamatsu, & Yoshida, 2014), oblast level regressions
were not feasible. The Beta model for Tajikistan thus used a national-level regression.

1.28    Assignment of candidate variables for matching proceeded by hand, comparing nationally-
representative means in the two data sources. Those variables deemed acceptable were included in the
model selection process. For those that were deemed to differ too greatly from one another â€“ due, for
instance, to slight differences in the wording of the question â€“ the variable was excluded and not used in
the model development process. Tables 1.1 and 1.2 provide comparisons of averages of a subset of variables


1
 The district level variables in the model were: â€œTotal number 26 to 30 years oldâ€, â€œTotal number 31 to 35 years
oldâ€, â€œTotal number 41 to 45 years oldâ€, and â€œDistrict-average of working adults in Mining sectorâ€.

compared at this stage. Each was evaluated at the household level, including for questions that were
gathered at the individual level in the questionnaire.

Poverty line

1.29    The poverty line was constructed for the 2007 TLSS survey results using the cost-of-basic-needs
approach, and updated for use in 2009 when another round of the TLSS was conducted. The resulting
poverty line depends on the cost of buying a diet of 2,250 calories per capita per day and an allowance for
non-food consumption. The nominal poverty line was set at 4.56 Somoni a day per capita (2007 prices), of

                                                       20
which 64 percent is food-consumption and 36 percent is non-food consumption.2 After adjusting for
different price levels across the country, the poverty line corresponds to a per capita monthly expenditure
of 138.7 Somoni per month in 2007 and 162.1 Somoni per month in 2009.

Model selection

1.30     From the pool of variables not excluded due to comparability concerns, a variety of model selection
techniques were employed and evaluated on the basis of several alternative criteria. Automated model
selection techniques (lasso, forward stepwise, backward stepwise, etc.) were complimented by manually
designed models and assessed in terms of out of sample performance. Thorough checks on the variance
composition were also conducted. The final model was partially selected on the basis of the combination
of a good adjusted R- squared and for a small ratio of location variance over total variance. For the model
used in this exercise, the ratio is 3%, which is smaller than the recommended 5% level. The hierarchical
error structure (province, psu, and household error) was also considered in the model selection process. In
this case, the variance share of the location/psu is small: var(psu) = .0134, var(epsilon or residual) = .188,
for a ratio of 6.6% of overall error variance.

1.31    Model validation (within the TLSS data) proceeded in several stages. First, a visual assessment was
conducted to ensure the similarity between predicted and empirical consumption distributions. This was
accomplished by withholding a subset of data, using the remainder as the â€œtrainingâ€ data, and subsequently
imputing into the withheld data to ensure the robustness of the approach. The resulting distributions can be
seen graphically in Figure 1.2. Poverty indices were then calculated to further validate the approach and
confirm the consistency of poverty estimates.

2.1     The final poverty map results for the method outlined above is included in Figure 2.1.
Districts that had lower poverty rates than the national average are presented in blue, while those
with a higher poverty rate than the national average are presented in orange. As expected, Dushanbe
had the lowest poverty rate in 2010, while GBAO had the highest. Rural areas are poorer than urban
areas on average, but low density areas represent a smaller share of the total poor in the country.
As is clear from Figure 5, the majority of the countryâ€™s poor live in the eastern districts, despite the
mountainous GBAO region recording the highest rate.

2.2    One approach to validate the results of the poverty map is to compare the poverty rates
implied by the aggregated small area rates from the poverty map, with the regional poverty rates
from the TLSS. This test succeeds in this case: the aggregated results from the poverty mapping
exercise were very close to the estimates obtained from the TLSS (Table 2.1).

2.3     For rural areas, the survey poverty rate estimate was 49.2%, while the estimate using aggregated
poverty map results stood at 51.0%. For urban areas, the survey estimate was 41.8%, while the aggregated
poverty map estimate stood at 39.0%. The standard errors were of similar magnitude in the survey
estimates and the poverty map aggregated estimates. This is not ideal, as the standard errors are
often smaller for poverty map estimates in comparison to direct survey estimates. However,
previous modeling exercises suffered from even greater imprecision. The results reported here are
consistent between the small area estimates and the aggregated regional results.

                       MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX (MPI) MAPS

3.1      There are several complimentary ways to present results from the MPI analysis. Figure 3.1 provides
the headline result: The national rate is 64 percent and the rates for the regions vary substantially. Driving a
considerable portion of these results are high levels of deprivation relating to education, and for those
districts outside of Dushanbe and other urban areas, access to infrastructure. In multidimensional terms,
Dushanbe is clearly the least poor out of the regions.

3.2       As Table 3.1 reports however, in contrast to estimates for monetary poverty, in the case the MPI,
RRP fares worst in terms of both multidimensional poverty and in terms of severe multidimensional poverty.
It is therefore not very surprising that there is only a weak correlation between the MPI measure of poverty
and the monetary measure, as shown in Figure 3.2.

3.3      It should be noted that although one might anticipate a strong correlation between each deprivation
and monetary measures of poverty (or consumption), it is not always the case that monetary poor households
are also multi-dimensionally poor, or vice versa. This is due to the fact that weighting in the deprivation
index introduces dissimilarities in the measure, as does the overlapping nature of deprivations. Indeed,
deprivation index approaches were developed because monetary poverty measures often miss important
attributes of poverty which are better captured in multidimensional measures.

  Please note that for many individual districts, the standard errors are substantial. For instance, 9 percent standard error means
the 95% confidence interval will be almost +/-20 percent. Individual district level results should be considered bearing in mind
the imprecision of specific estimates, and particularly in those cases with small populations.

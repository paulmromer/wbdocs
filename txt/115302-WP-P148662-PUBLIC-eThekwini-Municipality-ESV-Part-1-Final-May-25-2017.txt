PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This study forms one of the case studies of a larger study on Green Urban Development commissioned by the World
Bank and co-funded by The Nature Conservancy. Anchor Environmental Consultants (Anchor) was subcontracted
by AECOM to undertake case studies in three cities: Kampala, Uganda; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and Durban, South
Africa. Each city was consulted as to the focus of the case study. In the case of Durban, the city requested a study
to evaluate Durban’s natural capital and its role in Green Urban Development (GUD). The study is made up of two
parts. The first part provides an updated, spatial estimate of the value of natural capital in the eThekwini Municipal
Area and the second part is a scenario analysis that evaluates the potential returns to investing in GUD with a focus
on the role of natural systems. This study builds on the preparation of an Environmental Profile for eThekwini
Municipality by AECOM.

The ecosystem valuation study was led by Dr Jane Turpie and Gwyn Letley of Anchor Environmental Consultants.
Dr Robynne Chrystal and Prof Derek Stretch of CCS consulting undertook the hydrological modelling work, and Dr
Stef Corbella of CCS consulting prepared the engineering cost estimates. Grant Benn assisted with the GIS aspects
of the study.

We are grateful to the eThekwini municipal staff for their interest and support of this project, in particular to
eThekwini Municipality Real Estate Department for supplying the property transaction data and to the eThekwini
Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department for providing relevant GIS data and associated
explanations for the Durban Metropolitan Open Space System.

study suggest that remnant green open space areas
become increasingly valuable with urbanisation and
increasing incomes. Thus ensuring the protection of key
open space areas in the areas being settled would secure
potentially valuable sources of amenity and spiritual and
physical wellbeing for these future communities.

The role and spatial variation of regulating services is
particularly interesting. Carbon storage is the most
important of these services from a local economy
perspective, and is also important from an international
perspective. This value and the global value need
to be taken into consideration in South Africa’s and
eThekwini Municipality’s commitments to combating
climate change. The value of agricultural support

Although this was a desktop assessment which still
has substantial room for improvement and refinement
through further research, it represents the most
comprehensive assessment of ecosystem services within
an urban environment in Africa to date, and one of
perhaps only a handful in the world. Overall, the study
shows that the ecosystem services profile of an urban
area is very different from that of non-urban landscapes
or regional level assessments. While natural and semi-
natural ecosystems within the study area provide a full
suite of ecosystem services, the value is dominated
by amenity services to residents and visitors, both of
which make a considerable and tangible contribution to
Durban’s economy. Even so, the estimate of amenity
value does not capture all of the recreational, spiritual
and health benefits associated with of green open space,
since estimating these values requires further data
collection.

The findings of this study can be used to identify priority
areas for supply of ecosystem services and will be useful
for decision-making processes related to understanding
the tradeoffs between spatial development and
conservation. This is pertinent to both environmental
and strategic development planning within the
eThekwini Municipality in forming the development
of a thriving, resilient city. While the study focuses on
ecosystem services, it is important to note that it does
not provide a full estimate of the value of biodiversity
per se. Our study does not capture the existence
value and some of the other intangible, cultural values
attached to biodiversity, nor does it adequately capture
the role of species richness and community structure on
the capacity of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services.
This is a shortcoming of most valuation studies, and it is
for this reason that conservation and planning decisions
cannot be made on the basis of economic values alone.
Planning should also incorporate biodiversity targets
that are determined on the basis of their intrinsic value
and understood role in maintaining ecosystem integrity
and resilience.

2.3	 Biodiversity and D’MOSS
The EMA is situated in the centre of one of 34 Global
Biodiversity Hotspots, the Maputaland-Pondoland-
Albany region (EPCPD 2012). This region contains
more than 7000 vascular plant species, 25% of which
are endemic to the area (EPCPD 2012). The fact that
the EMA is located in a transitional zone between
warm tropical and cooler temperate features as well
as its topographical and habitat diversity means that
it supports relatively high levels of biodiversity within
this region (EPCPD 2012). The EMA contains three of
the country’s eight terrestrial biomes (savanna, forest
and grassland), eight nationally recognised vegetation
types (eastern valley bushveld, KwaZulu-Natal coastal
belt, KwaZulu-Natal hinterland thornveld, KwaZulu-
Natal sandstone sourveld, Ngongoni veld, scarp forest,
northern coastal forest and mangrove forest), 4000 km
of rivers, 98 km of coastline, 18 major river catchments
and 16 estuaries.

These natural assets fall within the EMA’s open space
system, which also includes agriculture, man-made parks
and sports areas. Known as the Durban Metropolitan
Open Space System, or D’MOSS, this system of green
open spaces covers 75 000 ha, or almost a third of
the total municipal area, above the high tide mark
(Figure 2.4; eThekwini Municipality 2012). The D’MOSS
system incorporates areas of high biodiversity value
that are linked together in a viable network (eThekwini
Municipality 2012). These include nature reserves such as
Paradise Valley and Burman Bush, large rural landscapes
in the upper catchment areas, riverine and coastal
corridors and some privately-owned land (eThekwini
Municipality 2012). A significant proportion of D’MOSS
land is located within the traditional authority areas in the
outer-west and southern planning regions.

The EMA’s natural open space areas can be categorised
into terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine and marine
ecosystems. These are distinguishable in terms of the
flora and fauna that are found in and around them and
the ecosystem goods and services that they provide
(EPCPD 2012). These natural and semi-natural areas,
found largely on the periphery of the EMA away from
the city centre, provide a wide range of ecosystem
goods and services across the whole study area. These
ecosystem services provide resilience and can help to
buffer the impacts of climate change and other pressing
issues. The key environmental issues and a detailed
description of the EMA’s ecosystem characteristics are
outlined below in more detail.

R6 280 per one kilometre stretch of river or stream. This
equated to a total usage of just over 122 million litres of
water per year extracted from rivers and streams within
the EMA with a total value of R32 million.

The households with the greatest reliance on rivers and
streams are located predominantly in the sub-places
located in the outer-west and southern planning regions
(Tribal Lands) and sub-places adjacent to the larger
river catchments such as the uMngeni and in poorer
areas such as KwaMashu and Inanda where households
in these sub-places are collecting up to approximately
750 m3 of water per kilometre stretch of river (Figure
3.2). In areas with the highest usage, this equates to
approximately R361 000 per kilometre per year.

these beehives is however, unknown.

Most rural households mainly grow their own maize, dry
beans and sweet potato which provide the majority of
their home-grown food (Institute of Natural Resources
2004). While none of these crops require pollination
there are certain households that grow their own fruit
trees and have small garden crops which benefit from
the pollination service provided by natural pollinators.
These crops and fruits only make up a small proportion
of the home-grown produce.

While we cannot account for the service provided
to individual households, we assume that it is small.
However, within the EMA there are just over 1000 ha of
known commercial fruit tree plantations and commercial
market gardens (eThekwini GIS department). We can
assume that these areas do benefit from pollination
services from natural pollinators, or rely on nearby

    Box 4.1	 Summary of the flood modelling method (details in Appendix 2)

    The full eThekwini catchment system was modelled using the US-EPA SWMM5 hydrology and hydraulics
    engine, interfaced by the PC-SWMM software. The calibration methodology adopted focused heavily on
    reducing the uncertainty during model set up.

    GIS subcatchment data available for this project from the eThekwini Municipality (EM) flood studies were
    in the order of 1 km2 and larger. The subcatchments were further discretised into smaller subcatchments,
    in the order of 0.2 km2, within the eThekwini Municipal Area (EMA). For the region outside of EMA, Shuttle
    Radar Topography Mission (SRTM – 30 x 30m cell size resolution) data were acquired and special analysis
    tools were used to discretise the model into 0.5 to 1 km2 sized subcatchments, with larger subcatchments
    closer to the source areas (Drakensberg). A spatial analysis tool was then used to process the flow paths,
    watershed boundaries, and river centre lines. The outlet points for the model were then identified and
    selected; i.e. dams, estuaries and stormwater infrastructure.

    EM flood models, based on geometric HecRAS files, were imported into the PC-SWMM model. These
    datasets account for approximately 30% of the EMA and contain limited stormwater infrastructure (e.g.
    culverts, bridges). The stormwater network shapefile for the EMA was incomplete and contained numerous
    errors and inconsistencies. These networks were amended where possible, however due to the extent of
    the required revisions, a more detailed stormwater network was only included in the U60F quaternary
    catchment. This quaternary catchment encompasses the main developed part of the city, and is also the
    study area for the green urban development scenario analysis, which is in an accompanying report.

    Available current GIS landuse files (e.g. zoning files, D’MOSS) were collated and reviewed. These files were
    concatenated into one consistent landuse polygon shapefile and the landuse classifications were reviewed
    and summarised into a common set of landuse conventions. The resulting shapefile was ‘groundtruthed’
    using aerial imagery for the whole of the EMA. The Southern African National Land Cover dataset (2013/14)
    was used for the catchments outside of the EMA. The 72 different landuse descriptions were summarised
    into a more manageable list of landuse categories consistent with those used within the EMA.

    A number of input parameters are required for SWMM5. These include hydraulic parameters, soil
    infiltration properties, rainfall and water quality parameters. The determination of the catchment
    characteristics was estimated using a spatial analyst tool for zonal statistics. Raster files were generated
    to represent the information required for the hydraulic and hydrological models, with reference to each
    subcatchment. The most significant input hydraulic parameter is the percentage of impervious area (Imperv.
    %). The hydraulic parameters were assigned to each landuse classification based on literature. The largest
    proportion of rainfall losses over pervious areas generally occur due to soil infiltration. The Green-Ampt
    method was adopted for this study. This method provides a soil memory as opposed to a broad brush
    coefficient approach. Three user-specified soil parameters were used; i.e. capillary suction head, saturated
    hydraulic conductivity, and the maximum available moisture deficit. Average daily abstractions and return
    flows/discharges were added as point sources at the appropriate junctions. There are a number of large
    dams in the EMA. For simplicity, the model was split by routing all the flows entering the dam to an outfall.
    A new flowpath was created downstream of the dam.

    A user-defined hyetograph was used as the precipitation input into the model. The hyetograph was created
    using the total daily mean-areal precipitation depths derived by Smithers & Schulze (2000) for a 24-hour
    design storm. The temporal distribution was derived using a synthetic SCS Type II distribution for 2-, 5-, 10-
    and 20-year return periods.

    The final SWMM model of the full EMA comprised about 30 000 subcatchments. The eThekwini catchment
    system was divided into 3 separate models, representing the northern, central and southern catchments to
    reduce simulation running times (Figure 4.3).

The additional flood volumes that would occur under different return period flood events (e.g. 1:10 years), would
require larger drains, culverts, etc., depending on the size of the event they are designed to deal with. Thus a second
model was developed in order to estimate the capital costs of the structures required under the present versus the
without-vegetation scenarios (see Box 4.2). The difference, together with associated differences in maintenance
costs, is the total life-cycle cost avoided, which can be converted to a net present value which is the value of the
service.

    Box 4.2	 Summary of the method used to estimate engineering cost savings (details in Appendix 3)

    An analysis was undertaken to determine the difference in the replacement cost of stormwater
    infrastructure (including both conveyance and storage) between the existing stormwater infrastructure in
    the EMA and infrastructure that would be designed to different specifications depending on the amount of
    natural vegetation within the EMA.

    The adopted methodology for this analysis focused on estimating the cost difference of the infrastructure
    with and without natural/undeveloped areas in the EMA. The relationship between cost and flow for
    the status quo was established and used to estimate the cost of infrastructure based on changes caused
    to the flow as a result of having natural areas within the EMA developed into the average land use, i.e.
    what happens to the flows if the current D’MOSS is replaced with the average land use type within that
    catchment?

    The methodology used to determine stormwater infrastructure engineering costs is outlined as follows:

    1.	 Identify all stormwater infrastructure within the EMA

    2.	 Divide the infrastructure into four major categories (bridges, canals, culverts and pipes)

    3.	 Determine the dimensions of all infrastructure in the EMA

    4.	 Estimate the costs of the existing infrastructure based on these dimensions

    5.	 Assign rainfall design return periods to each category of infrastructure

    6.	 Calculate the maximum open channel flow from the Mannings equation (i.e. the threshold flow)

    7.	 Estimate a scaling relationship between infrastructure dimensions and flow using theoretical uniform
        flows

    8.	 Simulate the design rainfall return periods and estimate the maximum design flows for each scenario
        (status quo versus average land use)

    9.	 Use the maximum flows, the existing infrastructure dimensions and the threshold flows to scale the
        existing infrastructure to required infrastructure dimensions under the average land use scenario

    10.	 Use the new infrastructure dimensions to estimate the cost of the scaled infrastructure

    11.	 Compare the cost of the existing infrastructure to the cost of the scenario infrastructure

    Because much of the flood conveyance infrastructure is overdesigned for various reasons including the
    problems of blockages by litter, the estimation initially yielded a small cost to increase the size of the
    structures to deal with the difference in flows. Since this is clearly downward biased, a correction was then
    applied to adjust for this overdesign and produce a more comparable estimate from which to derive the
    realistic difference in value.

    The savings in the capital cost requirements for flood conveyance were estimated to be in the range of
    R63 – R338 million (Table 4.5, Figure 4.4). This represents a 0.7% - 3.5% capital cost saving in stormwater
    infrastructure. Including an estimated 6% of capital costs as an annual repair and maintenance cost
    (eThekwini Municipality 2015), this suggests that the flood attenuation service provided by natural systems
    in the EMA has a net present value in the order of R107 – R571 million (average R339 million; Table 4.5). We
    consider the upper bound value to be the closest approximation of the value of the service. The highest
    per hectare values associated with D’MOSS are located in catchment U20L and U60F, catchments that are
    situated above the built up areas of Durban city centre and Durban North (Figure 4.4). These D’MOSS areas
    in upper catchment areas therefore provide a significant flood attenuation service.

The average estimated flood attenuation value for
natural vegetation in each catchment was mapped to
the green open space areas within that catchment using
an estimate of the relative contribution of different
land parcels to flood attenuation modelled using InVEST
modelling software (Glenday 2012). This provided the
relative flood attenuation score given to each grid cell
within the EMA based on rainfall, soil and landcover. The
value per pixel was then determined for all green open
space areas (based on the latest GIS data of D’MOSS),
total flood retention value for each catchment, the
retention score given to the pixel and the sum of all
pixel flood retention scores. The value per pixel was
then divided by the area of the pixel to arrive at a flood
retention value per hectare estimate for all green open
space areas in the EMA.

Human activities within the landscape can lead to             In the EMA, natural sediment transport from catchments

wastes. Agricultural expansion, encroachment into             river, with very little sand contributed by the suspended

along the river bed, is coarse and generally moves at         solutions such as off-channel dams, and the control

addressed in Section 4.7.

The extent to which sediments end up in river systems
is determined by a number of factors including soils,
rainfall patterns (amount and intensity), slope and the
type and amount of vegetative cover. Vegetative cover
prevents erosion by stabilizing soil and by intercepting
rainfall, thereby reducing its erosivity (De Groot et al.
2002). This is particularly valuable where soils are highly
erodible. Vegetated areas, especially wetlands, may also
capture the sediments that are eroded from agricultural
and degraded lands and transported in surface flows,
preventing them from entering streams and rivers
(Blumenfeld et al. 2009, Conte et al. 2011). This protects
downstream areas from the impacts of sedimentation,
which can include impacts on water storage capacity,
hydropower generation and navigability of rivers
(Pimentel et al. 1995). While some level of sedimentation
of dams is expected under natural conditions and
planned for, elevated catchment erosion either incurs
dredging costs or shortens the projected lifespan of
dams and related infrastructure. Globally, anthropogenic
sedimentation has been estimated to account for
about 37% of the annual costs of dams (i.e. $21 billion)
in terms of replacement costs (Basson et al. 2009). In
urban contexts, elevated sediment loads also have to be
removed from sewerage systems, storm water drainage
systems and harbours.

    Box 4.3	 The main water supply dams of the EMA

    There are three large water supply dams in th EMA that have part of their catchment areas falling within the
    EMA, and that therefore potentially benefit from sediment reduction services delivered within the EMA as
    well as in the rest of their catchment areas1.

    Inanda Dam, located on the uMngeni River, is the largest of three dams and supplies water to Wiggins
    WTW the second largest treatment works in the EMA. It is the largest of the three water supply dams.
    Inanda Dam is located 25 km upstream of the uMngeni Estuary and is known to cut off the main source
    of coarse material to the estuary (Cooper 1993), trapping 99.6% of coarse sediments (CSIR 2008).

    Hazelmere Dam is located on the uMdloti River and supplies water to Hazelmere WTW on the north
    coast and also supplies water for agricultural irrigation. CSIR (2008) found that present sediment yields
    in this catchment are much lower than the historic levels, the result of significant land use changes (less
    subsistence agriculture and more natural vegetation).

    Nungwane Dam is the smallest of the three dams and supplies water to the Amanzimtoti WTW on the
    south coast. While the Nungwane Dam has a sediment trapping efficiency of 99.1%, the dam is situated
    on a tributary of the Lovu River and thus does not trap the main river sediment load moving to the coast.

        Note: Two other dams, the Shongweni Dam (Mlazi River) and Dudley Pringle Dam (Wewe River) were not included in this analysis for the following
         reasons: (1) the Shongweni Dam (capacity of 3.8 million m3) has been decommissioned as far as water supply is concerned. It is used only for
         recreational purposes; and (2) the Dudley Pringle Dam (capacity of 2.3 million m3) is owned by Tongaat Hulett and supplies water to Maidstone
         Sugar Mill. It is also used for irrigation purposes and the eThekwini Municipality have the rights to extract up to 15 Ml/day to supply Tongaat WTW.
         However, the dam is located on the northern border of the EMA with almost all of the catchment falling outside of the EMA.

    suspended sediments to the total sediment load
    is different for each catchment. For this study
    suspended sediment loads were multiplied by a
    factor of 1.25 in order to account for bed load.
    This is the factor generally applied in South Africa
    (Msadala et al. 2010, after Rooseboom 1992).

    By comparing the modelled sediment outputs
    per catchment under current land cover versus
    fully transformed land use, it was possible
    to estimate the difference made by natural
    vegetation to the sediment loads transported
    to dams and estuaries. Two scenarios were
    used to estimate the sediment retention service
    provided by existing natural vegetation in the
    EMA. The first scenario involved removing
    the trapping capacity of natural vegetation (a
    hypothetical construct) and the second involved
    replacing natural vegetation with dense rural
    settlement as a likely alternative land use. These
    two scenarios provided lower and upper bound
    estimates of the magnitude of the service. A
    detailed description of the model is provided in
    Appendix 4.

The overall net present value of the sediment retention service was estimated to be in the order of R35.17 million.
The portion of the value pertaining to each dam and the harbour was mapped to the green open space areas within
the relevant catchments using an estimate of the relative contribution of different land parcels to sediment retention
modelled using InVEST modelling software (Glenday 2012). This provided the relative sediment retention score given
to each grid cell within the EMA based on rainfall, soil and landcover. The value per pixel was then determined for all
green open space areas (based on the latest GIS data of D’MOSS), total sediment retention value for each catchment,
the retention score given to the pixel and the sum of all pixel retention scores. The value per pixel was then divided
by the area of the pixel to arrive at a sediment retention value per hectare estimate for all green open space areas in
each catchment.

4.7	 Water quality amelioration
The introduction of nutrients into the landscape
(anthropogenic eutrophication) can lead to reduced
water quality and the eutrophication of freshwater
and marine ecosystems. This reduces their capacity to
supply ecosystem services as well as increasing water
treatment costs (Graham 2004, Rangeti 2014). Nutrient
enrichment of water resources often occurs in highly
populated urban areas where agricultural activities,
use of fertilizers, untreated sewage, organic wastes and
water-borne sewage systems lead to increased nutrient
loads in surface waters.

Where excessive nutrients end up in water supply
reservoirs, the resultant algal growth leads to increased
water treatment costs. A number of studies have
analysed the effect of water quality variables on water
treatment costs in South Africa (e.g. Dennison & Lynne
1997, Graham 2004, Friedrich et al. 2009, Gebremedhin
2009, Graham et al. 2012, Rangeti 2014) as well as
globally (e.g. Dearmont et al. 1998, Nkonya et al. 2008,
Telles et al. 2013, McDonald & Shemie 2014, TNC 2015).

In the study area, Graham (2004) showed that the costs
of water treatment for four WTWs operated by Umgeni
Water increased as a result of increases in turbidity,
aluminium, iron, suspended solids, nitrates, total organic
carbon (TOC), total dissolved solids, silicon, coliform
numbers, potassium and algae in their respective
reservoirs. Rangeti (2014) also found that algae, turbidity
and TOC in the Inanda and Nagle Dams were the key
drivers in chemical dosage and chemical costs in treating
potable water at Durban Heights and Wiggins WTWs.             Figure 4.8	   Schematic diagramme of the consequences of anthropogenic

the Hazelmere Dam (and associated Hazelmere WTW) and Nungwane Dam (and associated aManzimtoti WTW) were
not available. The model developed for Nagle Dam and Durban Heights WTW was therefore applied to Hazelmere
and Nungwane. Nagle Dam is much smaller in size than Inanda Dam, with the dimensions of the reservoir being
more comparable to Hazelmere and Nungwane Dams. The technology and chemicals used to treat water at Durban
Heights WTW and at Hazelmere and aManzimtoti WTW are also comparable. The modelled impact of the removal/
replacement of natural habitats on phosphorus loads and water treatment costs was used to estimate the water
quality amerlioration value of natural open space areas in the catchment areas of each dam.

    The impacts of natural open space areas on water quality were estimated using a hydrological model set up
    in PC-SWMM software for the catchment area of the whole municipality. The model, described in Appendix
    4, was set up to estimate the average annual loads of nutrients entering raw water reservoirs of water
    treatment plants within the EMA.

    The EMC for nutrients, TIN and P, were derived from literature and applied to the different landuse
    categories within the study area. Simulated catchment runoff was coupled with the EMC values to estimate
    total annual nutrient loads. TIN and P loads were simulated for one year from August 2013 to August 2014
    (total annual precipitation of 572 mm for the Durban city area, lower than MAP).

    The annual phosphorous loads generated under current conditions were compared with what they
    would be if the natural systems were removed or transformed to a different land use, such as rural dense
    settlement. This provides an indication of the impacts of loss of natural areas on nutrient loads entering
    surface waters and the percentage change can be construed as an estimation of the water quality
    amelioration benefit obtained by retaining the natural systems.

    Box 4.9	 Relationships between increased N and TSS loads, estuary water quality and the status of
             estuarine fish communities

    Anthopogenic increases in nitrogen and TSS have a negative impact on estuarine health and the capacity of
    estuaries to deliver services such as recreational fishing value and nursery value (Figure 4.12). Estimation of
    the water quality amelioration service on estuary values required the development of a model to estimate
    the impacts of changes in N and TSS loads on water quality, and the impacts of changes of water quality on
    fish populations.




    Figure 4.12	 Schematic summary of the linkages from water quality parameters to estuary ecosystem services for a case of
                 deteriorating water quality.


    The relationships between water quality and fish abundance have been well studied in KwaZulu-Natal (Cyrus
    & Blaber 1987, 1988). Expert understanding of these and other relationships is used in the quantification
    of estuarine responses to changes in in the quantity and quality of freshwater inflows to estuaries. A
    substantial amount of work has also been carried out by groups of estuarine specialist scientists to describe
    the present status of estuaries throughout South Africa, following standardised methods of describing
    estuarine health developed for the setting of environmental flow requirements as well as for estuary
    management more generally (Turpie et al. 1999, 2012). These require the description and scoring of all the
    abiotic and biotic components of estuaries, including water quality variables and fish communities. These
    scores have been collated and summarised for the most recent National Biodiversity Asssement of estuaries
    (van Niekerk & Turpie 2012).

    Analysis of the health scores for the 16 estuaries in the study area revealed a strong linear relationship
    between a sub-element of the overall water quality score (based on nutrients, TSS, oxygen and heavy
    metals, but not salinity), hereafter referred to as the Water Quality Score (excluding salinity), and the Fish
    Score (Figure 4.13).

    The effect of nutrient and TSS loads on the Water Quality Score was then determined based on the
    relationship between modelled annual loads for the EMA estuaries and the Water Quality Score. The annual
    loads were first standardised to account for differences in catchment size, characteristics and rainfall
    by expressing them in terms of natural Mean Annual Runoff. After exclusion of two outliers, there was a
    significant negative logarithmic relationship between the standardised N, P and TSS loads and the Water
    Quality Score (Figure 4.14). These relationships were used to estimate changes in the Water Quality Score as
    a result of loss of the natural vegetation in the catchment, and to estimate the consequent impacts on fish
    populations and values.

    The modelled loads under the status quo and the two alternative scenarios (removing the ecosystem
    service) were then used to generate modelled water quality scores. The percentage difference in
    these scores was used to adjust the actual water quality scores. The latter were then used to estimate
    diffrences in the fish scores. Again, these differences were used to adjust the actual fish scores. Finally, the
    proportional change in fish scores was used to estimate changes in the fishery and nursery values of each
    estuary, as a measure of the damage costs avoided.

Statistical analysis of these patterns in relation to the features of the different grid cells showed trhat the numbers
of photographs were significantly influenced by the presence of certain land cover types, and that the interaction of
man-made and natural features was important in determining the attractions of the latter (see Box 5.1 for details).



    Box 5.1	 Analysis of photo densisty

    A generalized linear model was then used to analyse the numbers of photographs per grid cell in relation
    to the extent of different land use/land cover types within each grid cell. This was to determine the factors
    influencing the relative values of the cells.

    A semi-log model was used for the analysis where the dependent variable was the natural log of the
    photo count within each grid cell. The independent variables included in the model were based on a
    number of different land uses and land cover types as adapted from the combined D’MOSS and LULC map.
    These included the amount of commercial/retail land, industrial land, roads, urban settlement, informal
    settlement, rural settlement, agricultural land, parks, golf courses, natural land not within protected areas,
    land within protected areas, dams, estuarine and marine areas. Interaction terms were included e.g. to
    account for accessibility in reaching certain land cover types.

    Data were analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression in R Project for Statistical Computing
    (ver. 3.2.0). Collinearity amongst variables was tested and those that displayed high levels were removed
    from the model as suggested by the software analysis through stepwise regression techniques. The model

    The results indicated that accessibility is an important factor in the value of natural open space. Natural
    open space outside of protected areas only had a significant effect in interaction with roads. Similarly,
    coastal environment had a significant effect in interaction with the built environment (commercial and
    urban settlement areas only), reflecting the importance of beach front accommodation and amenities.
    Photographs often included beachfront activities or views of the beach from hotels and restaurants along
    the coastal strip. Natural open space within protected areas was highly significant, with these areas having
    a high number of photographic uploads. Dams and estuaries were both positive and highly significant, with
    high concentrations of photographic uploads of these features. Rural settlements had a negative influence
    on photograph counts due to the low number of photgraphic uploads in these areas as a result of visitor
    inaccessibility. Urban, commercial and industrial land cover had a positive and significant influence on
    photographic counts due to the high numbers of architectural and cultural photographs taken in the urban
    areas across the EMA. Variables that did not influence model results included informal settlements, parks,

(5) marine or coastal. The built environment category
included urban, dense rural and informal settlements, as

Following this, the percentage contribution of different
settings to tourism value was determined for each grid

actual land cover within each grid cell in the EMA based
on the combined LULC/D’MOSS map.

In this way, the total value added by leisure tourism
(R5.6 billion; Table 5.2) was assigned to five different
land use classes within each grid cell. The total nature-
based tourism value was mapped using GIS and is shown
in (Figure 5.3). A number of the natural areas with the
highest values were located within nature reserves, such
as Kranzkloof, Shongweni, Beachwood and Umhlanga
Lagoon. Estuaries, such as Durban Bay and uMngeni also
had high values. The total tourism value assigned to
natural habitats (natural vegetation, freshwater systems,
estuaries and the coastal environment) was almost
R2 billion and accounted for 40% of all photographic
uploads (Table 5.4) with the coastal environment
contributing just over half of this value. The tourism
value associated with the coast was very high, with the
most popular coastal areas having values of up to R66
million per kilometer stretch of coastline (Figure 5.3).
Man-made open space such as parks and golf courses
had a total leisure tourism value of R382 million at an

of the population in the EMA, this resource is thought to
be the most valuable in terms of the service it provides
per user household. The remaining values represent
approximately R225-292 million of the total provisioning
value of natural resources in the study area (Table 6.1).
Regulating services have a net present value of about
R1.0-1.2 billion with carbon storage and flow regulation
accounting for 39% and 34% of this value, respectively.
This value is believed to be a conservative estimate. The
many benefits derived from these supporting services
are indirect and particularly difficult to value, and most
of the regulating services also play the role of supporting
services that influence the outputs of other ecosystem
services. The amenity value associated with natural and
semi-natural open space areas in the EMA was estimated
to be R45.7-59.4 billion, 96% of the overall value of
ecosystem services (Table 6.1).

value and some of the other intangible, cultural values attached to biodiversity, nor does it adequately capture the
role of species richness and community structure on the capacity of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services. This is
a shortcoming of most valuation studies, and it is for this reason that conservation and planning decisions cannot be
made on the basis of economic values alone. Planning should also incorporate biodiversity targets that are determined
on the basis of their intrinsic value and understood role in maintaining ecosystem integrity and resilience.

A1.3.2	 Estuaries of the EMA
All five of the estuarine types are represented within the KwaZulu-Natal Province but only four are found within the
boundary of the EMA (Table A1. 4). The only type not represented in the EMA is that of large estuarine lakes, such
as St Lucia. More than half of the estuaries found in the study area are highly degraded or in a poor state of health
(Table A1. 4). The biggest threats to estuaries in the EMA include habitat loss, organic and chemical pollution from
WWTW, informal settlements and industrial activities, unregulated sand mining, overexploitation, and upstream
freshwater diversions or abstractions.

Most of the estuaries in the EMA have been well studied and the main characteristics of each system are described
in the Table A1. 5, based on information available in the literature. A comprehensive technical report of the estuaries
of the eThekwini Municipality was produced in 2008 by Forbes & Demetriades and much of the below information
comes from this study.

Although the east coast supports a wide range of fish
and invertebrate species there are few commercial
fisheries that actually operate. This is largely due to
the fact that the KwaZulu-Natal coast is very nutrient
poor when compared to the Atlantic coast which is
dominated by upwelling events and subsequent high
productivity. The continental shelf along the east coast
is also very narrow, limiting the habitat available to
support productive commercial fisheries (DAEARD
2010). Commercial fisheries operating on the east coast
and within the EMA include commercial linefishing,
prawn trawling, pelagic longlining, beach seine-netting,
and oyster harvesting (DAEARD 2010, Everett 2014).
Recreational and subsistence fisheries such as shore
and boat-based linefishing are also important both
ecologically and economically (DAEARD 2010).

A2.1.4	 Subcatchment delineation
The study area was divided into subcatchments and the
outlet points were identified (subcatchment runoff is
routed to a single discharge point). Outlet points can be
defined as nodes of the drainage system or they can be
routed to other subcatchments.

The GIS subcatchment (watershed basins) data made
available for this project were derived from EM flood
studies and are in the order of 1km2 and larger. Although
appropriate for flood studies, the information relevant
to this scope of works required discretisation into
smaller, more appropriate subcatchments, in the order
of 0.2km2, within the EMA (Figure A2. 2). These new
subcatchments were processed from high resolution,
.IMG raster files (DEM files). The raster files were
converted to .flt float files which can be used as a TIN
(Triangulated Irregular Network). A spatial analysis tool
was then used to process out the flow paths, watershed
boundaries, and river centre lines.

For the region outside of the EMA, Shuttle Radar
Topography Mission (SRTM – 30 x 30m cell size
resolution) data were acquired and used to process
the same special analysis tools to delineate watershed
information. These two data sets were merged, as
required for the scope of works. The SRTM data is not
intended to provide detailed analysis results, but will
allow for a qualitative assessment on a larger scale
than just the EMA zone. The region outside of the
EMA was discretised into approximately 0.5 to 1 km2
subcatchments with larger subcatchments closer to the
Drakensberg Mountains. Both subcatchment files were
merged into one file.

A2.1.5	 Flow lines
The EM flood models, based on geometric HecRAS files, were imported into the PCSWMM model (Figure A2. 3). The
geometric file contains more information with regards to stormwater infrastructure (culverts, bridges etc.), however,
it does not contain the stormwater network. These data sets only account for approximately 30% of the EMA and do
not include the catchments beyond its boundaries. Flow paths simulated using a watershed delineation tool (WDT)
were appended to the HecRAS files in order to represent the required study area.

There are a number of large dams in the eThekwini catchments, including Midmar Dam, Albert Falls Dam and Inanda
Dam. Routing river flows through a dam is a fairly complex exercise which requires bathymetric data or hypsometric
curves, time stamped/current water level data, knowledge of siltation rates and updates on whether the gates are
open/closed, if there is overflow. In order to provide continuity through these dams and best represent the impacts
of dams on flood flows, the model was split by routing all the flows entering the dam to an outfall (Figure A2. 4).
Inflows were subsequently input downstream of the dams based on the analysis of data collected from the relevant
water authorities.

A2.1.7	 Stormwater network
A shapefile of the stormwater networks was provided by the eThekwini Municipality. The current available
stormwater shapefile is incomplete and contains numerous errors and inconsistencies (see Figure A2. 5). Invert
levels and pipe sizes are often missing and connections are incorrect and/or missing. For this reason, the stormwater
network was only included in the U60F model. Available networks were amended where possible, i.e. a standard
circular pipe size of 0.375m was allocated to pipes with missing geometry and tools were applied to either fill in
missing invert levels (from the DEM) or to apply slopes within the network. Where necessary, main pipelines had
to be added to these networks. The pipe profiles were later checked to ensure reasonable slope gradients and the
continuity of flows.




Figure A2.5	 Current available stormwater shapefile (the red lines represent the flow paths, yellow lines are stormwater conduits and blue dots
             represent stormwater junctions).



The eThekwini Municipality is presently carrying out an SMS (Stormwater Management System) audit of all
stormwater infrastructure. The audit entails a visual inspection and assessment of all stormwater infrastructure from
which shapefiles of existing junctions, stormwater pipes and culverts are generated. Where available (see Figure A2.
6), these new shapefiles were imported into the model and connected to existing stormwater networks and flow
paths. Continuity in these networks were checked and errors/connections were corrected where necessary. The
original stormwater shapefile was merged with the new SMS shapefiles and both were connected to the HECRAS and
WDT flow paths. Again profiles and connections were checked.

A2.3	    Storm design events
Standard techniques for flood estimation generally
include the analysis of observed peak discharges and
event modelling using rainfall-runoff techniques,
however observed streamflow data are often not
available in South Africa. The most common technique
for many engineering and conservation design decisions
is therefore to use rainfall event-based methods.
Smithers and Schulze (2000) compiled tables of design
rainfall depths at selected rainfall stations for different
durations based on frequency analysis of the annual
maximum precipitation for a given duration from
historical rainfall data. This data is listed based on a
latitude and longitude grid for a variety of recurrence
intervals from 2 to 1000 years for storm durations from
5 minutes to several days. The duration of design rainfall
may range from five minutes for small urban catchments
(with a rapid hydrological response) to a number of days
for large regional flood studies.

The design rainfall depth used in design flood estimation
should be based on the critical storm duration or
time of concentration (TC) of a catchment. The TC is
defined as the time required for rainfall based runoff,
with a spatially and temporally uniform distribution,
to contribute to the peak discharge at the outlet of the
catchment outlet.

The eThekwini Municipality design rainfall spreadsheet
based on Smithers (2002) analysis of the region was
assigned to each subcatchment using an area-weighting
tool. One method is to assign a rainfall distribution
to the time of estimated concentration (Tc) for each
subcatchment. The SCS Type II distribution is the most
relevant in general, and the total rainfall for a given Tc
will be used to calculate the intensity for each RP (Figure
A2.9).

The final SWMM model of the full EMA comprised about 30 000 subcatchments. The eThekwini catchment system
was divided into 3 separate models, representing the northern, central and southern catchments in order to reduce
simulation running times (Figure A2. 10, Figure A2. 11, Figure A2. 12, and Figure A2. 13).

A2.5.3	 Calibration of flows and water levels
The models were calibrated using available measured flow                 There is reasonable agreement between the simulated
and water quality data. Note that in some cases gauging                  water depths and the measured water depth at the DWA
stations did not provide adequate data for calibration                   gauging station on the Nungwana River at Umbumbulu
purposes, for example there is no measured flow data                     (Figure A2. 17). The simulated peak flows were, however,
for the Umbilo and Umhlatuzana Rivers. Therefore,                        predicting much higher flows than those measured at
emphasis was placed on setting up the model as                           the gauging stations. This indicates that the actual losses
accurately as possible. Simulated peak flows for the rivers              were higher than in the modelled flows (the volume
were compared with those estimated in other studies                      of the simulated flows is greater than the volume of
conducted in the EMA by Jezewski (1984) and Mkwananzi                    measured flows as shown in (Figure A2. 18). In addition,

results of the model are within an acceptable range. The                 the simulated volumes, the flow paths were increased
results certainly highlight the changes between between                  to include more tributaries, thereby increasing the time

reasonable certainty in the model outputs.                               which may also be smoothing out measured peak flows.

The full eThekwini catchment system was divided into
3 separate models, representing the northern, central
and southern catchments in order to reduce simulation
running times. Models were calibrated separately.
Measured flows and water depths were compared with
simulated flows and water depths on the uMsunduze
(uMgeni) River. Simulated water levels were lower
than measured water levels. Return flows from the
wastewater treatment works were added as a constant
‘baseflow’. There appears to have been an irregularity in
the measured data with the large rapid increase in flow
and water level, this was neglected (Figure A2. 16).

The sensitivity of the model to various hydraulic parameters was tested using the SRTC tool on PCSWMM (Table A2.
12). The sensitivity of the results was tested for the various parameters. The results were most sensitive to changes
in the depression storage and % imperviousness. Simulated flood peaks were compared with those estimated by
Jezewski in 1984 (Table A2. 13). Jezewski (1984) used a simple rational method approach to estimate the 2-year flood
peak flows for the different rivers.

A2.5.4	 Calibration of water quality
Monthly water quality data collected by the EM Water and Sanitation Division were used for calibration and
validation of the model. Most of the rivers within the EM are monitored

The water quality measured at the outfalls of the WWTWs were analysed. These values were significantly lower
than those provided in the General Effluent Limits. These values were replaced with the average TIN, P and SS values
measured at each outfall of the WWTWs (see Table A2. 14).

Simulations were run for a one-week period from the 1 – 7 July 2014 at 2-second time interval. This period was
chosen because there was one rainfall event experienced throughout the subcatchment. The results from these
simulations are given in Figure A2. 20 and Figure A2. 21 below. The corresponding water quality parameters
measured at the same points are provided in Figure A2. 22. Note that the simulated values are within reasonable
range of the measured values.

APPENDIX 4: SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT MODELLING

A4.1	Introduction
The contribution and retention of natural areas to
nitrogen (TIN), phosphorous (P) and sediment loads (TSS)
was determined under two different scenarios. These
two scenarios were chosen in order to provide a range of
what the water quality changes would be considering a
conservative and a worse case assumption.


A4.2	Model setup
The water quality parameters chosen for this study were
nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous) and total suspended
solids (TSS). The input parameters for each pollutant are
as follows:

 the pollutant name

 the concentration units (i.e. mg/L, µg/L, counts/l)

 concentration in rainfall

The results from the second hypothetical scenario
determine the impacts on water quality if all
conservations areas (D’MOSS areas) were replaced by
dense rural informal settlement. This scenario provides
a worst case scenario as changing the landuse from
natural vegetation to dense informal settlement has
a dual negative impact, i.e. informal settlements are
associated with a high event mean concentration of
pollutants and the removal of natural vegetation reduces
the uptake of nutrients and sediments. The landuse
file was edited and all natural vegetation was replaced
with rural informal settlement. The area weighting tool
was used to import the new shapefile into SWMM with
the corresponding changes in hydraulic, soil and water
quality properties associated with the change in landuse.

The total water treatment costs at Durban Heights WTW in terms of chemical cost composition were similar to those
described by Graham (2004). Caogulant (and flocculation) costs and disinfection costs contributed the most to the
overall treatment costs with coagulant costs contributing 41.4% and disinfection costs 42.9% (Figure A5. 2). The
coagulant and disinfection processes during water treatment remove unwanted sediments, algae, odours and colour
from the raw water.

Treatment costs increased steadily between 2010 and 2015 (Figure A5. 3), with clear seasonal fluctuations.
Treatment costs were higher over the summer months from November through to March when rainfall is at its
highest in the EMA.

The regression estimates for the water treatment model where treatment cost (R/ML) is the dependent variable and
a number of water quality parameters are the independent variables is shown in Table A5. 4. The model was highly
significant with an R-squared of 0.922, representing a strong relationship between actual and predicted treatment
costs (Figure A5.4).

Phosphorous loads in the uMngeni River entering Nagle Dam were positively and significantly correlated with water
treatment costs at Durban Heights WTW (Figure A5. 6, Table A5. 5). Phosphorous loads were strongly correlated with
Turbidity, TSS, E.coli, Iron and pH levels in the raw water abstracted for treatment. Phosphorous loads (kilograms of
TP) were the highest over the summer rainfall months from November through to March resulting in increased water
treatment costs as a result of increased turbidity, algae and coliforms within Nagle Dam and the subsequent need for
higher coagulant and disinfection chemical dosages at Durban Heights WTW.

The model relating water treatment costs to phosphorous loads in the uMngeni River was significant with a
reasonable fit to the actual treatment cost data provided for Durban Heights WTW (Table A5. 5, Figure A5. 7). The
model relates changes in sanitation and land use within the uMngeni catchment to changes in water treatment costs.
It is assumed that improved sanitation would decrease the phosphorous loads entering Nagle Dam, decreasing the
frequency and magnitude of algal blooms, coliform numbers and TSS and therefore ultimately decreasing water
treatment costs at Durban Heights WTW.

A5.5.2	 Wiggins WTW
The percentage breakdown of water treatment costs
at Wiggins WTW are similar to those at Durban Heights
WTW, with disinfection and coagulant costs making
up 88% of total costs (Figure A5. 8). Water treatment
costs increased between 2010 - 2015 (Figure A5. 9). On
average water treatment costs are cheaper at Wiggins
WTW than at Durban Heights WTW with a mean of R67
per ML compared to R72 per ML at Durban Heights. This
is similar to the findings presented in Graham (2004).
One explanation for this could be the size difference
in the dams supplying the raw water to the treatment
works. Inanda Dam is approximately ten times larger
than Nagle Dam allowing for increased mixing and
diluting of nutrients resulting in significant differences
between the quality of water entering the dam and the                   Figure A5.8	 Percentage treatment cost breakdown at Wiggins WTW.
quality of water being abstracted from outlet point for
treatment. Rangeti (2014) noted that although Inanda
Dam is considered badly polluted, the sheer size of the
dam allows for dilution and mixing which improves the
water quality before abstraction.

The water treatment cost model results for Wiggins WTW are shown in Figure A5. 10 and Table A5. 6. The model was
highly significant with Algae, Manganese, Alkalinity and the algal genera Anabaena having significant effects on water
treatment costs. From the model it seems that algae has the largest influence on treatment costs at Wiggings WTW.
Algal levels in Inanda Dam tend to increase during the summer rainfall months when nutrients entering waterways
increase. Algae tend to increase filtration time and increase coagulation dosage during treatment (Rangeti 2014).
Certain genera, such as the filamentous cyanobacteria, Anabaena, can have a significant impact on the taste and
odour of the water being treated. When Anabaena cells are present in high numbers water treatment costs increase
substantially.

Phosphorous concentrations in the uMngeni River above Inanda Dam have increased since 2010 (Figure A5. 11a).
Phosphorous loads (kg of TP) were calculated using these concentrations and flow data from the same monitoring
station. It was found that phosphorous loads at this site follow the same pattern as those found in the uMngeni
River above Nagle Dam (Figure A5. 11b). However, the TP loads above Inanda Dam are significantly higher than those
above Nagle Dam. It is expected that the higher phosphorous loads are a result of the Msunduzi River which joins
the uMngeni River before this monitoring point. The Msunduzi River is known to be highly polluted. Although the
phosphorous loads entering Inanda Dam are higher than those entering Nagle Dam, the size of Inanda Dam has a
large dilution and settling influence on the water in the dam. Phosphorous loads entering Inanda Dam were found to
have a significant impact on water treatment costs at Wiggins WTW (Figure A5. 12).

The model relating water treatment costs at Wiggins WTW to phosphorous loads in the uMngeni River was
significant, although the fit of the model to the actual treatment cost data was not as strong as the model for Durban
Heights WTW (Table A5. 7).

The reason for this can be explained once again by the size of Inanda Dam and the impact that dilution and mixing
has on the incoming phosphorous loads as well as the direct correlation that phosphorous loads have with algae,
TSS and temperature. Although the fit of the model is not strong, the relationship between treatment costs and
phosphorous loads is significant. The analysis showed that there was a possible slight lag in phosphorous loads
entering Inanda Dam and the treatment costs at Wiggins WTW. There are unknown variables within the system
that would influence phosphorous levels such as temperature, wind, degree of dilution and mixing and the amount
of phosphorous entering the system directly through runoff from rural settlements surrounding Inanda Dam.
Understanding and capturing these complex interactions is difficult but from the analysis it is clear that phosphorous
loads in the uMngeni River do have a significant influence on water treatment costs.

A5.6	Conclusions
From this analysis it is clear that water quality had
a significant impact on the cost of treating water at
each of the WTWs studied. The models developed for
Durban Heights WTW and Wiggins WTW are useful
tools that can be used to predict the impacts of changes
in water quality on water treatment costs. Regression
coefficients, estimated using ordinary least squares,
quantified the independent effects of each of the water
quality parameters, such as phosphorous, as significantly
effecting water treatment costs. These models can
therefore be used to predict the outcome of catchment
land-use changes, such as the impact that natural
vegetation has on reducing nutrient runoff into surface
waters. Using a simple scenario approach, comparisons
between the status quo and modelled outputs can be
related to the treatment costs and overall cost savings
can be estimated.

Unexpectedly, river systems, regardless of their
condition, had a negative impact on housing prices at
the immediate and neighbourhood scale. Whilst the
percentage decrease on property value is relatively
small ranging from 0.001-0.025% (R12 – R250), it is
still surprising that even when in a good condition the
proximity to rivers is considered negative. This could be
that people prefer to have views over river gorges, such
as in the areas of Hillcrest and Kloof, but consider rivers
in close proximity to property as a negative influence
as they are known to attract informal settlements,
are prone to flooding and can be considered breeding
grounds for unfavourable insects such as mosquitos.

Other types of green open space, such as golf courses
and park areas both had a significant positive effect on
house prices at the 300m, 1500m and 5000m scale. At
the immediate scale, for every extra one hectare of golf
course within a 300m radius house prices increased by
2.9% (R29 000) and 1.4% (R14 000) for parks. Similarly
golf courses and parks influenced property prices
positively at the neighbourhood scale with every extra
hectare of golf course increasing house prices by 0.27%
(R2700) and every extra hectare of park land by 0.21%
(R2000). Sugarcane farmland had a significant positive

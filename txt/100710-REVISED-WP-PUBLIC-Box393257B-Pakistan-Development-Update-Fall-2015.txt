Executive summary

 A mild growth         Pakistan’s economy posted GDP growth of 4.2 percent in FY2014/15 compared to
 recovery is           4.0 percent in the previous year, but below the 5.1 percent targeted growth
 underway.             envisaged for FY2014/15 in the Annual Plan. On the demand side, investment and
                       government consumption posted strong growth. Private consumption was
                       supported by record high remittances in the order of US$18.7 billion in FY2014/15.
                       The share of investment in GDP remains relatively small, at 15.1 percent of GDP,
                       about half of the South Asian average at 30 percent. More worryingly, private
                       investment as a share of GDP has been declining and stood at 9.7 percent of GDP
                       in FY2014/15. This low investment has implications for Pakistan’s long term

                       special section III in this issue.

 Lack of               Several factors are contributing to this low investment normal. Constrained fiscal
 complementary         space limits the government’s ability to make the necessary complementary public
 public investments    investments. In addition, inconsistent trade and industrial policies create
 and a weak            disincentives for investors and contributes to weak business environment, as
 investment climate    evidenced by Pakistan’s ranking in most international surveys dealing with this issue,
 are constraining      like the Global Competitiveness Ranking. Another reason for the very low
 private sector        investment levels has to do with the low domestic savings rate in Pakistan at below
 investment.           10 percent of GDP, which compares unfavorably with an average of around 25
                       percent in South Asia. Limited access to financial markets, high dependency ratio
                       and low returns on financial instruments all contribute to this low rate of savings.

 The services sector   More than two-thirds of the economy’s growth came from the services sector, while
 continues to be the   industry and agriculture jointly contributed about one-third. In the agricultural
 main contributor to   sector, crop performance remained weak owing to prolonged adverse weather and
 growth.               two years of relatively low prices. In the industrial sector, the poor performance was
                       primarily the result of weak growth in the large-scale manufacturing sector, which
                       achieved growth of 2.4 percent against a target of 7 percent. Ongoing energy
                       shortages, limited external demand and structural bottlenecks all constrained
                       industry growth. The weak growth in the industrial sector also acted as a drag on
                       related services sectors such as trade and communications, which also posted
                       relatively slow growth. On the positive side, transport, finance and insurance and
                       government services all posted strong growth.

 Government efforts    The overall deficit for FY2014/15 was 5.3 percent of GDP, 0.3 percentage points
 for fiscal            higher than the revised estimates. The declining trend represents a break from the
 consolidation         recent past, with deficits between 6 and 9 percent of GDP between FY2009-10 and
 continue, but         FY2012/13. The reduction in the deficit was achieved through curtailing the federal
 progress is slower    development budget and above target non-tax revenues, while tax revenues
 than anticipated.     continued to fall short of targets. Energy subsidies remain large, although lower oil
                       prices have contributed to limiting the energy subsidy bill. Spending grew fastest at
                       the provincial level due to post 7th NFC award availability of higher resources, and
                       devolution of increased responsibilities (see special section II for a detailed
                       discussion of Pakistan’s current Fiscal Decentralization Framework). Total public
                       debt stood at 64.6 percent of GDP at the end of FY2014/15, a slight decline from
                       the previous year. Domestic debt continues to dominate the debt stock, despite
                       healthy disbursements by the IFIs, the continuation of the IMF program and the

A narrowing current      The current account deficit narrowed to US$2.6 billion (from US$3.1 billion in the
account deficit and      previous year), a result of record high remittances in the order of US$18.7 billion

financial inflows        are concentrated in oil producing countries (Saudi Arabia, UAE), the US and the
suggest a significant    UK. Remittances from oil producing countries may be negatively affected by low oil
turnaround in the        prices, but there are no sign of it yet. External financial inflows continued strong,

                         international reserves increased by US$4.4 billion to US$13.5 billion by end of
                         FY2014/15 or more than three months of next year’s imports (goods and services).
                         The turnaround on the external front has been quite impressive, which has also led
                         international rating agencies to upgrade the country’s sovereign credit ratings in
                         recent months.

The trade deficit        Exports declined in FY2014/15 and this decline was broad based, a result of both

imports increased        external demand. Textiles, which account for about half of all exports, posted a

economic activity.       commodity prices, although to a lesser extent than exports. Non-oil imports
                         increased significantly, in particular metals, food, machinery and wood and paper
                         products. As a result, the trade deficit widened in absolute terms.

Reserves buildup         As a result of the positive developments in the external sector, the Pakistan Rupee

                         percent in FY2014/15, its lowest level in a decade, the result of declining oil prices
                         being passed on to consumers and a stable exchange rate. The decline in inflation
                         was broad based, with both food and non-food items contributing to the
                         deceleration in inflation.

Improved                 The stability in PKR and the government decision to pass-on the benefit of falling

                        recently approved a National Financial Inclusion Strategy and started its
                        implementation, which may help in reversing this trend. For a more detailed

A mild recovery is                  Following a steady path of recovery, Pakistan’s economy registered a GDP growth
underway.                           rate of 4.24 percent in FY2014/15 compared to 4.03 percent in last year.
                                    Nevertheless, this performance was below the 5.1 percent targeted growth rate
                                    envisaged for FY2014/15 in the Annual Plan.

On the aggregate                    It is quite typical for consumption to be the largest component of aggregate

                                 Fiscal Consolidation Remains on Track for the Second Consecutive Year
Fiscal consolidation         The overall deficit for FY2014/15 turned out to be 5.3 percent of GDP, 0.3
continues, albeit at a       percentage points higher than the revised estimates, owing to provincial increased
slower pace than             spending as well as tax revenue shortfalls. Nonetheless, the budget deficit declined
anticipated.                 slightly from 5.6 percent of GDP observed in the previous fiscal year. The past two
                             years have been a break from the past four years (FY2009/10-FY2012/13) when
                             the fiscal deficit has hovered above 6 percent of GDP7 (see Figure 4). This break
                             has been a result of government efforts in tightening fiscal policy.




                             6 Railways posted a growth of 121 percent due to reduction in delays of passenger trains and

                             operational efficiency was improved.

FBR taxes continue            The budget target for tax revenues – 86 percent of total revenues – for FY2014/15
to experience                 was set at PKR 2,810 billion, which was revised downward during the year.
shortfall.                    Provisional data points to a collection of PKR 2,594 billion – PKR 11 billion lower
                              than the last revised estimate of PKR 2,605 billion – on account of FBR revenues,
                              recording an annual growth of 14.2 percent viz.-a-viz. collection in the previous
                              year8. Weak performance of sales tax (with 42 percent share in FBR taxes) as well as
                              direct taxes (40 percent share) appears to be the reason behind this moderate
                              growth (see Table 3). The underlying factors have been the decline in oil prices,
                              historical low inflation, sluggish LSM sector activity as well as non-implementation
                              of some revenue measures introduced at the time of budget that were challenged in
                              court9. Consequently, in order to compensate for the shortfall resulting from these
                              developments, the government implemented a number of additional tax measures10
                              during the course of the year. These additional measures have been able to only
                              partially compensate for the shortfall in tax revenue. Despite these headwinds, the
                              tax-to-GDP ratio increased from 10.5 percent in FY2013/14 to 11.0 percent in
                              FY2014/15 – the increase coming from the federal government only. This has been
                              possible due to some progress towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
                              tax administration as well as phasing out of Statuary Regulatory Order (SRO) related
                              exemptions.




                              8 Last year, the growth was 17.4 percent.
                              9 These measures included 5 percent income tax on bonus shares and Gas Infrastructure
                              Development Cess (GIDC). The GIDC bill was only approved by the end of fiscal year, on
                              May 22, 2015. The bill will not only authorize the government to continue collecting the
                              GIDC, but will also provide retroactive legalization to the GIDC the government has been
                              collecting since 2011.
                              10 These included raising GST rate on petroleum products from 17 percent to 22 percent

                              and then to 27 percent, levying regulatory duties of 10 percent on imports of more than 300
                              items and imposing a 2 percent withholding tax on non-filer service providers & importers.

                                          disbursements are effectively converted into PKR. As PKR is not an internationally traded
                                          currency, other currencies are bought and sold via selling and buying of USD. Hence, the
                                          currency exposure of foreign debt originates from two sources: USD/other foreign

                                           26 China is faced with lower exports of its high value added products due to lower demand
                                           and recession in EU, therefore suppressing exports from Pakistan. Similarly Bangladesh is
                                           also faced with lower exports to US and supply chain issues which resultantly led to lower
                                           imports of fabric from Pakistan.
                                           27 The key factors behind this growth are (i) increased numbers of workers going abroad,

                                           particularly skilled and qualified workers, (ii) enforcement of anti-money laundering
                                           legislation and (iii) implementation of Pakistan remittance initiatives (PRI) by the banking
                                           sector.

                                    shows that remittances from all major countries increased except the non–UK EU
                                    countries, which contributes only 2 percent in total remittance and hence have a
                                    negligible impact on overall volume and growth of remittances. The share of Saudi
                                    Arabia in overall remittances was the largest (31 percent); with the United Arab
                                    Emirates (23 percent), the United States (14 percent) and United Kingdom (12
                                    percent) together contributing 80 percent in total remittances28. Further declines in
                                    oil prices could affect remittances by affecting economic growth in oil producing
                                    countries—which are the source of 65 percent of total remittance.

Reserves buildup                                 The PKR remained largely stable with a small depreciation of about 3.0 percent
continued to ease                                against the US$ during FY2014/15. A stable nominal exchange rate and sharply
forex market                                     falling inflation resulted in REER appreciating by 7.9 percent during the period

indicators allowed                               substantial inflows in capital and financial accounts resulted in a buildup in SBP’s

Movement in                 While reserve money growth decelerated for the third year in a row to 9.9 percent in
monetary aggregates         FY2014/15, broad money supply grew by 13.2 percent in FY2014/15, compared
were largely dictated       with 12.5 percent in FY2013/14. The behavior of reserve money was primarily
by targets set in the       influenced by measures to limit government borrowing from SBP. This, along with
government’s reform         the outright sale of government securities to commercial banks, allowed the SBP to
program agreed with         limit growth of net domestic assets (NDA) for all quarters of the year. While these
the IMF.                    measures have constrained growth in NDA, overall positive external balance
                            allowed net foreign assets (NFA) of central bank to expand, albeit slower than in
                            FY2013/14 (see Table 7). The current account balance narrowed slightly during
                            FY2014/15; but limited FDI and capital and financial inflows led to a deceleration
                            of NFA growth during the year, particularly with regards to the central bank.

Broad money growth          This is reflected in strong expansion in NDA of banking system which grew by 11.7
was fundamentally           percent as compared to 9.1 percent in FY2013/14 (see Table 7). Although
driven by the               expansion in NDA is in line with the monetary easing during the year, a significant
government sector           part of this growth came from the government sector instead of private sector. In
borrowing for               absolute term, the government borrowed PKR 861.0 billion for budgetary finance
budgetary support           from the banking system in FY2014/15, compared with PKR 303.0 billion in
and commodity               FY2013/14. Within the banking system, the government heavily relied on
operations.                 commercial banks not only to finance its budget deficit, but also to retire some of its
                            borrowing from SBP. In addition, in a declining interest rate environment, banks
                            were also keen to lock-in their funds in high yielding assets. As a result of this

Despite this easing,         The government, as part of its economic reform program with the IMF, limited
overall market               borrowing from the central bank, and instead resorted to increased borrowing from
liquidity conditions         commercial banks. To ease these liquidity issues, SBP stepped up its liquidity

In addition to supply        The sharp fall in commodity prices and consequent reduced demand for working
side constraints,            capital and trade financing loans during the year coupled with energy constraints
there were several           remained key reasons behind this low demand for credit from the private sector. A
demand side factors          relatively high real cost of borrowing as inflation declined at a much faster pace than
that contributed to          lending rates also played a role in subdued private sector credit.34 Furthermore,
low off take of              constraints arising from structural weaknesses of the economy like power shortages,
private sector credit.       law & order, and weak external demand also played their role in curtailing overall
                             credit demand.

Slow credit off-take         Out of overall private sector credit, private businesses borrowed PKR 180 billion
in manufacturing             during FY2014/15 compared to PKR 298 billion in FY2013/14. Sectoral analysis in
sector dragged               Table 8 indicates that overall slowdown in credit offtake was most pronounced in
overall credit growth        manufacturing sector where it grew by only 4 percent in FY2014/1535 compared to
in private sector.           13 percent in FY2013/14. On the other hand, construction and ship breaking
                             sectors registered an uptake in credit.


                             33 For H1-FY2014/15, SBP injected on average PKR 161 billion through OMOs. This
                             increased on average to PKR 450 billion in H2-FY2014/15.
                             34 By end-June 2015, real weighted average lending rates in incremental credit was 5.44

                             percent.
                             35 This lower growth was fundamentally due to net retirement or slow off-take in textile,

                             food and Beverage sectors.

Inflationary pressure             The average Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation steadily declined by around 4
substantially eased               percentage points and reached 4.5 percent, its lowest level in a decade and well
during FY2014/15.                 below its previous level of 8.6 percent in preceding year and annual target of 8.0
                                  percent (see Figure 14). Similarly, year-on-year inflation exhibited a sharp fall
                                  particular from October 2014 onward mainly due to fall in global oil price, which
                                  was duly passed on to domestic consumers, and lower food prices (see Figure 15).
                                  Specifically, during Q1-FY2014/15, year-on-year inflation declined only marginally
                                  from the 8.2 percent to 7.7 percent by September 2014; after that it decelerated
                                  sharply in subsequent months and reached 2.1 percent in April 2014. Since then, it
                                  inched up slightly to 3.2 till June 2015.36

The decline in                                      During FY2014/15, year-on-year food inflation decelerated from 7.4 percent to 3.2

based with both food                                June 2015. The decline in international oil prices, which was regularly passed on to
and non-food                                        domestic consumers, led to lower transportation cost, capping of piped gas tariffs
segments                                            and only minor increase in electricity tariffs37 that kept energy prices low38. Whereas,
contributed to this                                 improved supply of commodities, particularly wheat and rice due to depressed
easing.                                             exports, coupled with timely imports of certain food items, contributed to low food
                                                    inflation during FY2014/15. Consequently contribution of food segment in Y-o-Y

                                                    group, the prices of perishable food items declined significantly as is evident from

                                                    improved supply management of onion and tomato crops (see Figure 17).

The banking system                                  The key driver of this robustness has been a shift in risk behavior of banks from

based on standard                                   achieved sizable growth, which is driven primarily by increased government
solvency indicators,                                borrowing. Commercial banks hold about PKR 4.99 trillion of government

                                                    while the capital adequacy ratio has increased from 15.1 percent to 17.2 percent
                                                    during the same period.

Profitability remains                               This positive trend has persisted but is expected to weaken on the back of an
high with return on                                 accommodative monetary policy stance which has reduced the policy rate by over

                          few years. It will be important for the country to now focus on a reform agenda that
                          accelerates growth and investment and ensures its sustainability.

The government            Reforming the energy sector continues to be a top priority as the private sector

                          2013. The policy foresees (i) adoption of a new tariff pricing formula, (ii) improved
                          operating efficiency and reduced losses within power distribution companies, (iii)
                          increased efforts to attract private sector investment to the sector, including the
                          privatization of a number of companies (both distribution and generation). In the
                          past year, the Government has implemented surcharges and adjusted prices with the
                          objective of achieving full cost recovery from consumers. The Government has also
                          developed a mechanism to monitor the accumulation of arrears in the sector
                          (circular debt) and adopted a plan for reducing the accumulation of arrears. This
                          plan includes the improvement of collections and reduction of operation costs and
                          losses (through revenue-based load management) and adoption of performance
                          contracts to improve management of the distribution companies. The Government
                          is also implementing a number of demand-side measures with regards to pricing,
                          metering-infrastructure and adoption of equipment standards for improved energy
                          efficiency and conservation. On the supply-side, the Government is improving the
                          fuel-mix in electricity generation, continues to invest and attract investment in
                          generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. There are a number of large
                          investments planned in the energy sector over the next few years (including through
                          the CPEC) that will add significant generation capacity.

                       provincial level. Provinces have now authority over services sales taxes, property
                       taxes and agricultural income taxes, all taxes with significant revenue potential which
                       is currently not being exploited. Despite these efforts – tax collection continues to
                       be below targets, suggesting the need to maintain the focus on this reform area and

                       adopted in October 2014 a plan to improve the investment climate. The reform
                       plan covers a broad range of issues to improve the investment climate, including
                       measures to improve (i) business start-up and registration, (ii) dealing with
                       construction permits, (iii) accessing credits, (iv) tax administration, (v) trade
                       facilitation, and (vi) contract enforcement. The Government has implemented a
                       series of reforms over the past few years, including the establishment of one-stop-
                       shops, started the implementation of a comprehensive tariff reform to improve
                       trade competitiveness and the preparation and adoption of a financial inclusion
                       strategy in early 2015, which includes the preparation and passing of a number of
                       key laws including the Credit Bureau Act, the Secured Transactions Law and the
                       Deposit Protection Fund. A number of reforms are under the responsibility of
                       provincial authorities. To improve the business environment at the subnational
                       level, the Federal Government is enhancing coordination with provinces and
                       developing province-level implementation plans to improve the business
                       environment.

declining.                            troubling is the declining trend of this ratio in recent years that reached a 35-year
                                      low by end FY2013/14 (See Figures 23). Persistently low level of investments has
                                      constrained growth potential. Hence, whenever the economy experienced demand-

                                      imports and current account deficits. This section discusses some of the reasons
                                      behind chronically low investment rates in Pakistan.

framework needs to        financing the requirements for strategically important sectors like energy, transport,
be strengthened.          telecom and water & sewerage. The private sector can also bring improved
                          management skills to the operation of infrastructure services. Table 12 below shows
                          that Pakistan has a relatively small number of projects where it successfully reached
                          financial closure. In terms of amount, Pakistan attracted about US$ 35 billion in
                          PPP compared to US$ 338 billion by India and about US$ 500 billion in Brazil over
                          the past 25 years. Not only is Pakistan quite behind other emerging economies in
                          terms of number of projects; but more importantly, the distribution is skewed
                          towards one sector. A major reason for low private participation in Pakistan has
                          been due to a weak legal framework, which outlines the modus operandi of private
                          sector involvement in financing and operating infrastructure facilities.42 The
                          provinces are seeking to fill this void, with Sindh and Baluchistan provincial
                          assemblies passing a public-private partnership bill in 2010 and Punjab and Khyber

Lack of coherent and      Inconsistencies in policies for different sectors over time have dented investors’
consistent industrial     confidence. Incidents like the Independent Power Producers-Government stand-
and trade policies are    off in the late 1990s; litigation over Reko Diq mining lease; contract enforcement
impeding investors’       issues with Engro Fertilizer; and, frequent changes in Compressed Natural Gas
confidence.               (CNG) policy have affected the interest of potential investors in Pakistan.
                          Government capacity in terms of designing and analyzing investment agreements,
                          including in terms of forecasting demand and supply, needs strengthening.
                          Investments that need uninterrupted gas supplies (e.g. fertilizer) are now facing
                          operational constraints given gas shortages. The lack of coherence in the country’s
                          trade and industrial policies has also played a key role in reducing industrial
                          investments. More specifically, tariff policies have not been supplemented by a
                          comprehensive industrial strategy to improve the competitiveness of local firms.
                          Entry in some sectors is difficult. Burki (2008) observed that industrial policies were
                          made either as part of medium-term development plans or in response to some
                          crisis the country was facing. He states that, “the frequent changes in industrial
                          policy have kept the industrial sector relatively backward compared to the
                          developments in other large Asian economies?.



                          42 Financing infrastructure and development projects in Pakistan has over the years been
                          made directly from budget allocations; therefore there is a lack of institutional and regulatory
                          capacity, which is necessary to facilitate private participation in infrastructure provision.

Foreign investors          Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been declining over a number of years and
have better options        compared to other countries’ performance is a point of concern.44 (see Figure 26)
available elsewhere.       FDI is also highly concentrated in a small number of sectors and countries of origin.
                           In the last 15 years almost 60 percent of FDI went to three sectors: oil and gas
                           exploration, communications and financial business. Such high concentration means
                           that negative developments in these sectors can have a disproportionate impact on
                           overall FDI, e.g. the law and order situation in the exploration areas has deterred
                           FDI in oil and gas exploration45 which has dragged down overall FDI in the
                           country. In terms of sources of FDI, the US, UK and UAE jointly contribute on
                           average 60 percent of total FDI making Pakistan highly vulnerable to economic
                           conditions or changing perceptions of investors in these countries.

Pakistan’s share in        The Inward FDI Performance Index46 measures the amount of FDI that countries
overall global             receive relative to the size of their economy (GDP). A value greater than 1 suggests
investment flow is         that the economy has received more FDI relative to its economic size, while a value
low and falling.           below 1 suggests that it has received less FDI. The inward FDI performance index
                           for Pakistan suggests that over the years, the country has lost momentum in
                           attracting FDI. In contrast, some other countries in the group have either stabilized
                           or improved (see Table 13). Initially, the fall in FDI flows to Pakistan was
                           considered to be in line with global trends as most of the countries in the region
                           were facing similar declines. However, while the FDI flows to a number of peer
                           countries have stabilized or resumed recently, they continued to fall for Pakistan.

Business                    Pakistan’s poor global ranking in business environment remains one of the key
environment needs           reasons that the country has not been able to attract sufficient investment. Almost
improvement.                all global indicators regarding governance and competitiveness show that Pakistan is
                            far below compared to its regional peers (see Table 14). Efforts to improve the
                            governance and the country’s investment climate should improve Pakistan’s ability

An economy which         Since independence Pakistan economy has been characterized by both high growth

growth.                  2006-2011 experienced low growth. The average growth rate during high growth
                         episodes was 6.7 percent while it remained around 3 percent during low growth
                         periods56 (see Table 19). Over the past few years, the economy has shown some
                         recovery but still growing below 5 percent. Generally the periods of relatively strong
                         growth tend to be associated with increased investment and trade, real exchange rate
                         depreciations, and with political stability57. Moreover, high levels of external aid and
                         ability to push through reforms also contributed to growth spurts. As the economy
                         has a very low domestic saving rate (as percentage to GDP)58, Pakistan has
                         remained dependent on foreign saving inflows to sustain its investments.

stagnation.              Hence, episodes of robust growth are frequent, but not sustained. This is not the
                         case in many comparable countries in the region such as India, China, Malaysia and
                         South Korea, which have all managed to grow at relatively high rates for a
                         considerable period of time. In contrast, Pakistan’s economic growth is
                         characterized as less volatile. Over the last five decades, the volatility of its GDP
                         growth, as measured by the standard deviation of the growth rate of real GDP, was
                         2.1 percent; near about the average in South East Asia60. However, this has been
                         increasing in recent times, rising from 1.4 in the 1980s to 2.5 in the 2000s.




                         56 High growth is assumed to be greater than 5 percent per annum.
                         57 Haussmann, Pritchett and Rodrik (2004) define growth accelerations as periods with an
                         increase of GDP per-capita growth of 2 percentage points or more for at least 8 years.
                         Accounting for population dynamics, in Pakistan such a figure would be roughly equivalent
                         to GDP growth of at least 5 percent.

                            rates in the 1960s and 1980s coincided with episodes of reform and economic and
                            political stability along with high levels of external aid. In contrast, during the 1970s
                            and 1990s, political disruption, economic uncertainty and regional tensions were
                            accompanied by few or incomplete reforms and, toward the end of the 1990s,
                            macroeconomic instability and the resulting inability of policymakers to implement
                            and sustain policies necessary for growth and poverty reduction. In addition, natural
                            disasters have taken their toll and explain a few episodes of growth deceleration.
                            This is certainly the case of the late 2000s—a period that witnessed four natural
                            disasters. See section V for a more detailed discussion about disaster risk reduction

                         capital’s contribution in output per worker has improved. TFP contribution has also
                         been relevant, but dramatically declining to about half from 1980s to 2000s.
                         However, these have recovered in last 5 years to 1.3 percent on average still below
                         medium-term average of 2.0 in East Asia67. Productivity has increased the most in

                         years (Table 20).

Contribution of total    Literature identified several factors contributed to the low TFP in Pakistan

overall labor            macroeconomic environment, financial developments, limited FDI and human

                         growth also appeared to be closely correlated with low TFP growth69. There is also
                         evidence from literature that the TFP decline in 1990s was a result of
                         macroeconomic factors70 whereby the need to curtail the fiscal deficit was mainly
                         done through cutting development expenditure and social sector expenditures,
                         which negatively affected human capital. The above mentioned results are
                         consistent with literature, which highlighting that high TFP growth is associated
                         with macroeconomic stability, high level of investments, low inflation and external
                         inflows.71 During 1980, a period of relatively high productivity growth, all sectors
                         benefitted from price stability, significant external inflows and the impact of large
                         investment made by public sector in 1970s72.

               IV. Federal Budget 2015/16 – Sectoral Analysis of Spending Priorities74
Federal Budget          This curtailment relies solely on 1.3 percent of GDP decline in recurrent spending
2015/16 envisages a     while development spending is expected to increase by 0.3 percent of GDP. In
reduction of 1.0        absolute terms, total spending is budgeted at PKR 4,030 billion for FY2015/16
percent of GDP in       translating into a growth of about 4.4 percent. While the recurrent expenditures
total expenditures of   are set to contract by 0.6 percent viz-a-viz last year and reach PKR 3,166 billion by
the Federal             the end of the on-going fiscal year, a 28 percent increase in development outlay has
government from         been programmed amounting to a size of PKR 864 billion. In terms of GDP,
14.1 percent in         federal development expenditures are budgeted to increase from 2.0 percent of
FY2014/1575 to 13.1     GDP in FY2014/15 to 2.3 percent for the current fiscal year. Of this, more than 80
percent in              percent has been allocated under the budget 2015/16 Public Sector Development
FY2015/16.              Programme (PSDP). Another 12 percent comprises of the flagship cash transfer
                        programme (BISP) that falls outside the PSDP bracket. The remaining includes
                        fertilizer subsidy (traditionally parked under this head), lump sum provision of misc.
                        items, and some other items.

There are structural    Given the rigid nature of non-development spending historically, the three top most
rigidities within       heads appear to be interest payments (with 40 percent share in total recurrent
recurrent budget.       expenditure), defense affairs (25 percent) and general administration – 14 percent
                        (see Figure 31). It is apparent that the increased security related spending
                        (manifested by an upsurge in budgeted spending for Defense and Law & Order for
                        FY2015/16) has been accommodated by cutting the budget of general public
                        service. This is encouraging despite the 7.5 percent increase in public sector wage
                        bill announced in the Budget. Grants, mostly directed towards the SOEs, still appear
                        to be making 13 percent of the total recurrent spending despite government’s
                        commitment to move ahead with reforms to restructure the loss-making enterprises.

Higher public           In the Budget speech, the Federal Minister for Finance alluded to concerted efforts
investment is           being made to attract private investment, in addition to increasing public
expected to crowd in    investment, through a variety of mechanisms such as promoting public private
private sector.         partnerships, FDI, and creating special economic zones with fiscal incentives. Key
                        priorities under the Federal annual development plan are listed below (see Table 21
                        and Figure 32). After infrastructure, rest of the categories appear to be shrinking

                        that has only been added to the development portfolio during the last fiscal year.

Social and economic           Social Services: In Pakistan, the fiscal architecture has undergone a considerable
sector, too, received         shift post 18th Constitutional Amendment79, thereby devolving the social subjects
significant                   largely to the provinces. Nonetheless, higher education and curriculum development
allocations.                  remains the responsibility of Federal government. Higher Education Commission is set
                              to receive PKR 20.5 billion this year. Moreover, the Federal government continues
                              financing of vertical health programmes80,81. As these projects are approaching their
                              culminations, the allocation has declined over time (for instance, from PKR 28
                              billion last year to PKR 20 billion in the FY2015/16 Federal PSDP). Thus, the share
                              of social services sector in Federal PSDP is budgeted to fall from 10 percent in
                              FY2014/15 to 6 percent in FY2015/16 (or from PKR 58 billion to PKR 43.7
                              billion).

                              80 Vertical programmes include 9 schemes on health and 7 on population planning, and
                              appear under the National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination Division in the
                              PSDP allocations.
                              81 By passing the Award before the 18 th Amendment, the federal government violated the

                              basic rule of decentralization sequencing i.e. ‘finance follows function’. As a result, the
                              provinces disassociated the transfer of responsibilities emanating from the 18 th Amendment
                              from the additional resources allocated under the 7 th NFC Award. The federal government
                              thus ended up retaining several big ticket vertical programs within the devolved subjects,
                              which continue to command a significant share of the federal PSDP. This squeeze is likely to
                              continue as the next NFC Award appears to be delayed by at least a year and the 2015/16
                              federal budget has been prepared on the basis of continuation of the current Award. (Source:

                           Economic Services: Almost similar allocations to the ones last year have been
                           made for food, agriculture & livestock82; IT; telecommunications; textile; and media
                           for 2015/16, aggregating to PKR 3.8 billion. Private sector largely dominate the
                           latter economic sectors in Pakistan, explaining low public investment levels.

FY2015/16                  Others: This sector includes development projects envisaged by various Federal
development budget         Divisions (see Figure 34) and has been allocated PKR 47.7 billion for the on-going
also focused on some       fiscal year. Most notably, Planning and Development Division has been allocated
special areas and          PKR 14 billion, compared to only PKR 6.2 billion spent by the division in
sectors, and started       FY2014/15. This allocation includes a block allocation of PKR 9.7 billion for un-
some new initiatives.      funded or underfunded important projects. This scheme appeared in FY2014/15
                           and amounted to PKR 27 billion. The considerable reduction in allocation of almost
                           PKR 17 billion in just one year indicates that most of the priority spending is being
                           financed from the regular PSDP, thereby leading to improved transparency with
                           respect to block allocations. Finance Division has been allocated PKR 9 billion,
                           mostly for provincial projects, including PKR 2 billion for Gwadar Development
                           Authority and PKR 1 billion for development of Ziarat Town. Moreover, allocation
                           for Interior Division almost doubled to PKR 8.3 billion, the apparent reason being
                           security related augmented spending. Similarly, Defense Division is set to receive
                           PKR 7.2 billion in this year.
                           Special Areas: For FY2015/16, PKR 43 billion has been allocated for development
                           projects in special areas – Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Gilgit Baltistan (GB),
                           Northern Areas and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) – that are

has been increased by an almost parallel 26 percent, the financing of provincial
programs from the federal budget needs to be limited. Spending on earthquake
reconstruction and rehabilitation83 is projected at PKR 7 billion.
New Programmes: This category – with 17 percent share – comes second after
infrastructure as the Federal government priority for 2015/16. Allocation for two
new programs that appeared in the revised estimates of last year, Special
Development Programme for Temporary Displaced Persons (TDPs) & Security
Enhancements and Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, is budgeted to continue
and to increase. Former is allocated PKR 100 billion while latter is set to receive
PKR 20 billion for 2015/16.
Benazir Income Support Programme: BISP, as it is abbreviated, was launched in
July 2008 with an immediate objective of consumption smoothening and cushioning
the negative effects of slow economic growth, the food crisis and inflation on the
poor, particularly women, through the provision of cash transfers of PKR 1,000 per
month84 to eligible families. The non-PSDP item is an important pillar of
government’s development agenda as the project focuses on poverty eradication
and women empowerment over the long term. The programme has been allocated
PKR 102 billion for 2015/16, representing more than 155 percent increase since
FY2012/13. Moreover, out-reach of this cash transfer programme is envisaged to
expand to 5.3 million beneficiaries by the end of next financial year, showing an
increase of 29 percent since FY2012/13.

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Angola perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Angola
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Angola
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to July 2015, 386 stakeholders of the WBG in Angola were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management Units
(PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on WBG-
supported projects/ programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; non-profit
organizations/community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 91 stakeholders participated in the survey
(24% response rate).

Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via email. Some others completed
the questionnaires on the phone or online. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing
Angola; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the
WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in
Angola; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 20%, N=119). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’15 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 94).

Familiarity with the World Bank Group

        survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’15 = 4.5; weighted mean in FY’12 = 5.0)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Angola, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Angola.

Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the FY’12 Country Survey indicated that they most
       often attributed failed or slow World Bank assisted reform efforts to the following: “there
       is not an adequate level of citizen/civil society participation? (45%) and “reforms are not
       well thought out in light of country challenges? (31%).
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from CSO, consultants
       on the WBG projects, and employees of ministries/PMUs were significantly more likely
       to attribute failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to that “there is not an adequate
       level of citizen/civil society participation? compared to respondents from other
       stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Angola, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the eight specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Angola. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at water and sanitation; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Angola, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agriculture and rural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at water and sanitation; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year20
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2015 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.

FY ’12 Number of comparable respondents = 108  FY ’15 Number of comparable respondents = 83

By weighting, FY 2012 and FY 2015 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

A4. The World Bank Group’s “Shared Prosperity? goal captures two key elements, economic growth

following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Angola? (Choose no more than
TWO)
 1    Better employment opportunities for young people
 2    Better employment opportunities for women
 3    Greater access to micro-finance for the poor
 4    Greater voice and participation for citizens to help ensure greater accountability
 5    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
 6    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
 7    A growing middle class
 8    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
 9    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
 10   Consistent economic growth

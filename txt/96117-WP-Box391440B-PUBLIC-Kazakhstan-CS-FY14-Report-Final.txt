I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Kazakhstan perceive the Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Kazakhstan regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Kazakhstan;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Kazakhstan;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
               Kazakhstan;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Kazakhstan.
       Use data to help inform Kazakhstan country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In November 2013 – January 2014, 372 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Kazakhstan
were invited to provide their opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the country by
participating in a country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the
President; the office of the Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian;
ministries, ministerial departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/contractors working
on World Bank Group-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs)
overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and
other organizations. A total of 192 stakeholders participated in the survey (52% response rate).
Respondents either completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency or they
received the questionnaire via courier or email and returned it accordingly. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Kazakhstan; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank
Group (WBG); the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Kazakhstan; and the WBG’s communication
and information sharing in Kazakhstan.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Kazakhstan: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Kazakhstan
   is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
   and generating economic growth in Kazakhstan, and how “shared prosperity? would be best
   achieved in Kazakhstan.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Kazakhstan, WBG staff
   preparedness to help Kazakhstan solve its development challenges, their agreement with
   various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest
   values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in
   Kazakhstan, with which stakeholder groups the WBG should collaborate more, in which
   sectoral areas the WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge
   services), and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Kazakhstan, the extent to
   which the WBG meets Kazakhstan’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments,
   and the WBG’s level of effectiveness across thirty one development areas, such as economic
   growth, governance, private sector development, education, and job creation.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Kazakhstan: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Kazakhstan, and which
   services the WBG should offer more of in the country.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement that they use
   more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Kazakhstan, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 146 respondents (88% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2003. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of consultants/contractors working on World Bank
        Group-supported projects/programs were combined with respondents from PMUs;
        respondents from bilateral agencies were combined with those from multilateral agencies;
        respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from
        private sector organizations; and the few respondents from the office of a parliamentarian
        were included in the “Other? category. There were no respondents from the office of the
        President, the office of the Prime Minister, local government officials, private
        foundations, community based organizations, independent government institutions, trade
        unions, faith-based groups, and the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location
       The majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Astana/Almaty. Because
        of the small number of respondents from other areas, these locations were combined
        under the “Other? category for all further analyses.
       Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found in
        Appendix C (see page 93). Only significant differences between geographic locations in
        response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Across all respondents, familiarity with the World Bank Group received a mean rating of
        6.1; this was significantly lower than the mean rating received in the FY ’03 country
        survey (6.8).
       Respondents from other organizations had the highest levels of familiarity with the WBG
        whereas respondents from the office of Minister had significantly lower levels of
        familiarity.
       Respondents from Astana/Almaty and other geographic locations had statistically similar
        levels of familiarity with the WBG in Kazakhstan.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Kazakhstan, and
        significantly, moderately correlated with their perceptions of the WBG’s relevance to
        Kazakhstan’s development, and the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in
        Kazakhstan.

IV. General Issues Facing Kazakhstan
Headed in the Right Direction
       Respondents in this year’s country survey were significantly less likely to indicate that
        Kazakhstan is headed in the right direction compared to respondents from the FY ’03
        country survey.
       A majority of respondents across all stakeholder groups indicated that Kazakhstan is
        headed in the right direction, except respondents from the media who tended to indicate
        that they were not sure whether Kazakhstan is headed in the right or wrong direction.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Attributing Slow or Failed Reform Efforts
       While respondents from the media, bilateral/multilateral agencies, and employees of
        ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies tended to attribute slow or
        failed reform efforts to the Government working inefficiently, respondents from the
        office of Minister, academia/research institutes/think tanks, and private sector/financial
        sector/private banks tended to indicate that the WBG is not sensitive enough to
        political/social realities on the ground, and respondents from NGOs tended to indicate
        that there is not an adequate level of citizen/civil society participation.

        Kazakhstan. Respondents from the office of Minister had the highest ratings for the
        importance, whereas respondents from NGOs had statistically lower ratings.
       Respondents across geographic locations had significantly different ratings for the
        importance of the World Bank Group to be involved in “transport?, “water resource
        management?, and “disaster management?. Respondents from Astana/Almaty had
        significantly higher ratings than respondents from other areas.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were significant differences across stakeholder groups in their ratings of the
        WBG’s effectiveness across three of these thirty-one development areas in Kazakhstan.
        For the most part, respondents from the office of Minister and PMUs/consultants/
        contractors on WBG-supported projects tended to give the highest ratings for the WBG’s
        effectiveness, whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and the private
        sector/financial sector/private banks tended to give significantly lower ratings. Those
        areas with significant stakeholder differences were:
             “Transport?;
             “Environmental sustainability?; and
             “Anti corruption?.

       Respondents across geographic locations gave statistically similar ratings for the WBG’s
        effectiveness in these thirty-one development areas.

       Responses across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations can be found in the
        Appendix.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Kazakhstan,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions

*Shared prosperity – The World Bank aims to promote income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in each country. This
involves achieving economic growth which is inclusive of all sections of the society. Inclusion demands equity so that it becomes the focus
point. The incomes of the bottom 40 percent of a nation’s population will be tracked through a new Shared Prosperity Indicator; the GDP
growth data alone is not sufficient.

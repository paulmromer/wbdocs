Financing for Gender Equality –
Results and Good Practices

Mr. Secretary-General, Ministers, and friends. It’s wonderful to see you.

Twenty years ago, the landmark Fourth World Conference on Women put forward a
Platform for Action that made a powerful case for gender equality. Among other things,
it recognized two important principles: (1) “that equality between women and men is a
matter of human rights and a condition for social justice;? and (2) that “broad-based and
sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to
sustain social development and social justice.?

Two decades later, we are in the middle of a watershed year for our work to advance
gender equality and end extreme poverty. We know based on evidence that gender
equality is not only a condition for social justice but a powerful driver of the economic growth
that can help deliver it—the inclusive growth that benefits all. And we now have data to
prove that the world cannot achieve its potential —or secure its future—unless all its people
can achieve and secure theirs.

Yet since 1995, progress toward gender equality has been uneven. We have made
important strides in health and education. We have reached parity in primary education
between girls and boys. Maternal mortality declined by 45 percent between 1990 and 2013.

But we have fallen short in bringing women’s assets, earnings, and employment in line with
those of men. This should galvanize all of us to arm ourselves with the best possible
evidence about what works to close these gaps, leverage new partnerships and funding
streams, and sharply scale up the smartest, most promising programs to meet these
challenges.
At the World Bank Group, we are finalizing a new gender strategy. A centerpiece of that
plan will be developing and sharing knowledge about gender equality as a critical pathway
to achieving our twin corporate goals: ending extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared
prosperity.

To develop our new strategy, we’ve been consulting with ministers, lawmakers, private
sector leaders, civil society groups, and others around the world. And we are hearing time
and again that in addition to healthcare and education, women need equal access to good
jobs, skills training, and financial resources such as collateral, credit, and bank accounts.
They need efficient, safe transportation and tangible support in caring for the very young
and the elderly. They need freedom from epidemic gender-based violence, and the ability to
play a decisive role in determining the course of their own lives.

Economic growth is the most powerful tool we have for realizing a world free of
poverty. The world economy needs to grow faster and more sustainably. It needs to grow in
ways that ensure the extreme poor and the bottom 40 percent receive a greater share of the
benefits of that growth. In short, it needs inclusive growth that promotes opportunity for all,
and that requires the full participation men and women.

The data clearly indicate that more resources make a big difference. Between 2002 and
2013, development assistance to advance gender equality increased substantially:
Countries on the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee more than tripled their aid
from $8 billion to $28 billion. Much of this financing supported gender equality initiatives in
education and health.

But this increased financing still falls far short of what’s needed—in health, education, skills
training, and many other areas.

The World Bank Group is helping to mobilize more resources on a number of fronts: Just
yesterday, several partners here launched the Global Financing Facility, which combines
resources from donors, the private sector, and developing countries to end preventable
maternal and child deaths by 2030. Another example came two years ago, when the
Secretary-General and I announced the Sahel Women’s Empowerment and Demographic
Dividend project when we visited the region. Working with several public and private sector
partners here today, the Bank Group is providing more than $170 million dollars for the
initiative, which will improve access to quality reproductive, child, and maternal health
services for women and girls in five West African countries.
But in other areas such as transport and storage, communications, and energy, women’s
jobs are lower paying and less secure. In these fields, women run smaller businesses,
employ fewer people, and create fewer jobs. This adds up to a costly missed opportunity
for women, families, communities, and economies.

Now it’s time to finish the job we started with the MDGs. Clearly we need a new financing
mindset. In moving “from billions to trillions,? aid remains vital—it creates enabling
conditions and sets the stage for lasting progress. But it represents only a part of the
financing needed to achieve our goals and meet our policy commitments.

Now also is the time to catalyze and leverage new streams of financing, from public, private,
domestic, and international sources. Collecting taxes fairly, efficiently, and transparently is
critically important —in ways that don’t penalize women when they bring home a second
income, for example, or spend money on food and other goods that sustain their families.
So is government spending on the smartest possible investments that lift constraints and
unleash the potential of all citizens, such as access to safe, high-quality transportation,
water and sanitation, and energy.

In recent years, the World Bank Group launched its new Gender Innovation Labs to conduct
evaluations of what works to close gaps in earnings, assets, and productivity. Our
Innovation Labs apply results and lessons learned to support the design of innovative,
scalable interventions that address gender inequalities.

We shared lessons from our Adolescent Girls Initiative pilot with Liberia, where adolescent
girls who received business, job, and life skills training were 47 percent more likely to find
employment. They also increased their earnings by 80 percent. In Uganda, girls who took
part in a similar program also saw dramatic improvements in their economic outcomes.
Importantly, they reported fewer instances of gender-based violence: They were 44 percent
less likely to report having had sex against their will over a 12-month period.

The challenges we have set for ourselves are significant. But they are exponentially more
achievable if we work together, leveraging our comparative advantages and working in
partnership to innovate.

We have worked with the United Nations and with governments to convene a new
Community of Practice of Finance Ministers for Gender Equality. You’ll hear more about this
initiative during the panel discussion. It works at the ministerial and technical level to
promote public financing for gender equality and make national budgets more effective in
supporting opportunities for women and girls.

To deliver women’s economic empowerment, we’re focused on learning the best ways to
improve labor standards and conditions; support equal access to the full range of credit,
banking, and financial services; raise agricultural productivity; and connect farms to
markets.

The results will be game-changing: When women earn more, public finances will improve
and commercial profits increase because of increased demand and productivity. When we
promote true equality—including equal pay for equal work—we all stand to benefit, because
better educated mothers produce healthier children, and women who earn more invest
more in the next generation. Creating a level playing field is always good for business, and
it’s especially good for women.

This kind of inclusive growth is vital to ending extreme poverty over the next 15 years. Only
by empowering women and giving them an equal opportunity for jobs, and equal pay for
equal work, can we be the first generation in human history to end poverty in our
lifetime. Reaching that goal will be one of humankind’s greatest achievements. And I have
no doubt women will lead the way. Thank you very much.

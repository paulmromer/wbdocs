1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. Why GVCs matter
Once concentrated among a few large economies, global flows of goods, services, and capital now reach
an ever larger number of economies worldwide. Global trade in goods and services increased 10 times
between 1980 and 2011, while FDI flows increased almost 30-fold. The sales from foreign-owned firms
amount to $26 trillion. As many as 3,000 bilateral investment treaties have been signed to create the
framework of deep agreements needed not only to facilitate the global movement of final goods and
services but also to internationalize entire processes of production. All these flows have grown over time,
creating increasingly dense and complex networks.

One of the most significant reasons behind this transformation in global trade and investment has been
the rise of global value chains (GVCs). Falling transport costs, greater global openness and cooperation
on trade policy, and the ICT revolution have allowed production processes to be increasingly unbundled
and shared across countries. Developing countries now join GVCs to further increase their economic
competitiveness and they industrialize by densifying their participation. This is a huge change from the
20th century when countries had to build entire supply chains domestically to become competitive
internationally (Baldwin 2006; see Antràs and Rossi-Hansberg 2009 and Ahmad 2013 for an overview of
the literature).

An implication of this is that GVCs denationalize comparative advantage, and this changes the options
facing developing and developed nations, participants and non-participants. Globally competitive ‘lead
firms’ knit together national comparative advantages to build components in the most cost‐effective
locations. Factories in developing nations have become full-fledged participants in international
manufacturing networks. These factories are no longer are merely importing parts for assembly, in order
to service domestic markets; rather, they are exporting parts and components used in some of the most
sophisticated products on the planet. In short, 20th century globalization was about made ‐ here ‐
sold‐there goods crossing borders: the trade system helped those nations able to produce finished
goods domestically, sell products abroad. But 21st century globalization is also about factories crossing
borders, so intra-factory flows of goods, know-how, investment, training, ideas, and people are now
international commerce. The trade system now can help nations make things, not just sell things.

1.2. Measuring GVC participation
In this context, understanding a country’s current participation in value chains is beneficial to ensuring
that its industrial and trade policies can facilitate sustainable productivity gains and increased quality
employment within higher value-added sectors. But examining trade participation and performance
through a GVC lens requires a revised way of measuring and analyzing cross-border and cross-industry
flows in goods and services. In particular competitiveness in specific components and tasks (rather than
comparative advantage in end products) is paramount, enabling participation within larger production
networks and, in turn, increased value addition generated domestically over time.

Indeed, from a country perspective what matters ultimately is the value addition generated in the country
from its export activity, and whether it increases (nominally) over time. This is not a new question for
economics. Value addition is a function of productivity, but it is associated with the breadth, variety, and
sophistication of tasks and activities in which a country specializes. The concept of domestic value added
in exports is, therefore, an essential concept to understand the importance of GVC trade for a country.
This concept allows us to distinguish the foreign and domestic content of a country’s exports, at it also
                                                                                                          1
accounts for the fact that some of the imported inputs may contain domestic value added that is
processed in a foreign location and reimported. This concept is explained in more detail in Appendix 1.

Analysis of value added trade is based on the use of input-output tables which, while sacrificing the
specificity of using customs classifications on parts or components, allow tracking usage explicitly at a
sectorally disaggregated level and differentiating between transactions that are intermediates and those
consumed as final demand by firms, governments, or consumers. This has been central to a recent
proliferation of studies examining the development of value added in production and trade, starting with
Hummels et al. (2001) and more recently elaborated by Koopman et al. (2010), Foster et al. (2011), and
Johnson and Noguera (2012), among others.2

1.3. The relevance of GVCs for SACU countries
GVCs offer potential new opportunities for the five countries of the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU): Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. With global offshoring continuing to
grow and wages rising in China and elsewhere in East Asia, substantial migration of value chains to Sub-
Saharan Africa is expected (Lin, 2011). The SACU region – with its abundance of natural capital and surplus
labor, along with a relatively high quality infrastructure and institutional environment – may be in a good
position to attract GVC-oriented investment. Beyond assembly manufacturing that is typical of GVCs (e.g.
apparel, electronics, automotive), the region should also be well-placed to compete as a location for
value-addition to agricultural and mineral commodities (“beneficiation”). Both types of investment would
not only drive exports and have the potential to create significant employment, but also support
productivity upgrading by accessing global technologies and knowledge.

While across the region there is significant interest in facilitating integration into GVCs as well deepening
integration of regional value chains (RVCs), there remains limited evidence of the extent of current
integration, either globally or regionally. The most systematic assessment to date comes in the African
Economic Outlook (AfDB 2014), which notes that the wider Southern Africa is currently leading the
continent in terms of GVC participation, accounting for 40% of Africa’s combined backward and forward
integration, driven primarily by South Africa. In discussing the relevance of GVCs for the five SACU
countries individually, the aforementioned African Economic Outlook summarizes the main GVC-related
constraints and opportunities for each African country, including short profiles of the SACU countries (see
Box 1). Substantial analysis has also been carried out within the more qualitative GVC literature of
particular value chains in the SACU countries, including South Africa’s automobile sector (c.f. Barnes and
Kaplinsky 2000; Black 2001; Barnes and Morris 2008) and horticulture industry (c.f. Barrientos and Visser
2012), and Lesotho’s and Swaziland’s apparel industries (c.f. Morris, Staritz and Banes 2011; Staritz and
Morris 2013). However, with the exception of South Africa, which is featured in the recently released
WIOD and OECD/WTO TiVA multi-region input-output databases, little empirical data on GVC
participation, positioning, and performance is available for the other SACU countries.

    Box 1: African Economic Outlook’s assessment of current and potential value chains for SACU countries
    Drawing on the African Economic Outlook’s country notes (AfDB 2014), the region’s most recent trade policy
    review (WTO Secretariat 2009), as well as a cursory review of country strategy documents, the SACU countries
    have, when compared to other African countries, made greater inroads in terms of value chain integration.

    Botswana has a relatively open economy, and has benefited substantially from its natural resource boon. The
    sectors in which Botswana is most engaged in global trade are mining, vehicles, textiles, beef and tourism, with


2   A third approach lies in using customs data on processing trade (Gorg 2000, Swenson 2013, Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez 2013).
                                                                                                                             2
 diamonds to the US, Europe, and Japan as the largest export commodity. Currently its manufacturing exports are
 only growing slowly and have low domestic value added and high import content. Increasing value addition from
 mining (by, for example, carrying out more processing and manufacturing domestically) as well as the growing
 tourism sector are seen to have substantial potential.

 The clothing, textile, and livestock value chains are of central importance for Lesotho. Clothing accounts for 60%
 of total exports and employs 80% of the country’s manufacturing labor force, functioning as the largest employer
 outside of government. Currently, Lesotho’s clothing sector participates primarily within US -based buyer-driven
 GVCs but there is scope to expand further the recently growing market share in South Africa, given Lesotho’s
 geographical advantages over Chinese imports. Livestock is currently the largest contributor to agricultural value
 added and could be further developed as an export sector. This will, however, require overcoming significant
 challenges including poor nutrition and low quality products, weak market links, and limited access to financial
 services. For textiles, there are concerns about inadequate skills.

 Despite recent efforts at diversification – particularly in the fish and meat processing and mineral industries –
 Namibia currently remains relatively minimally integrated into value chains. The country’s extraction and
 processing of minerals is the main growth driver but given its relative capital-intensity, it has only limited
 employment impacts. While constrained by skills shortages (especially at the mid-level) and regulatory obstacles,
 Namibia’s proximity to South Africa and its well-developed infrastructure offers potential to connect to regional
 and global supply chains. This has motivated the recent development of export-processing zones and the granting
 of special manufacturing incentives.

 South Africa is unique on the continent for the scale of its participation (and in some cases leadership) within
 GVCs, including the automobile, mining, finance, and agriculture sectors. In manufacturing (and particularly
 automobiles) it serves as an assembly hub for Africa, and this industry accounts for more than 6% of GDP. Mining,
 which is predominantly locally owned, is even more significant, accounting for 19% of GDP while the sector has
 substantial spillovers into financial services and housing. The finance and retail industries also have substantial
 presences in other African countries. According to the AEO, South Africa’s advantages pertain particularly to skills,
 research capacities, as well as well-developed and dense networks of local supply industries and services.

 Despite Swaziland’s declining attractiveness to foreign investors (following the investment boom of the 1990s),
 the role of GVCs remains significant and investment stock remains high considering the size of the economy. Its
 main exports include sugar and sugar products, forestry, processed fruit, textiles, soft drinks, and some diverse
 manufactures. Value addition is hampered by the only limited stages of production that the country engages in
 and, in turn, a heavy reliance on South Africa for goods and services inputs.

1.4. Objectives and structure of this note
This note is intended provide an overview of SACU countries’ participation and performance in GVCs,
drawing on several data sources and indicators, and most importantly the recently released 189-country
Eora multi-region-input-output (MRIO) database (Lenzen et al. 2012, 2013). Following this introduction,
the note is structured in five additional sections. Section 2 discusses in greater detail the scope of the
report, including the data sources and methodological approaches, as well as their respective limitations.
Section 3 looks at structural integration in trade, including the degree to which SACU countries import
and export intermediates. Section 4 analyzes trends in value-added exports as a first step in exploring
GVC participation. Section 5 hones in on the core measures of GVC participation and a brief analysis of
SACU countries’ position in GVCs. Finally, Section 6 concludes by bringing together the main findings from
the analysis.

2. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY

2.1. Data sources and background to the Eora database
This note makes use of several data sources to carry out the analysis. Aggregate trade data and data on
trade in intermediates (Section 3) comes from UN Comtrade, as does the analysis of upstreamness
(Section 5). In addition, the note draws on indicators of domestic value added embodied in gross exports
based on the Francois et al. (2013) database3. The most important data source for the analysis of GVCs,
however, is the Eora database – this is discussed in more detail below.

The simplified Eora database is disaggregated into 189 countries and 26 sectors per country (including a
‘rest of world’ sector that captures statistical discrepancies)4. It is thus the only MRIO database that has
relatively comprehensive coverage for sub-Saharan Africa. This makes it well suited for longitudinal
analysis of value chain integration of developing countries not included in other datasets. 5 The Eora
database, much like the OECD/WTO’s TiVA database, uses available information to produce measures of
trade in value-added for all countries. In order to produce a contiguous and continuous dataset, values
has been interpolated for countries lacking necessary data. Eora has a historical time series spanning
1990-2011 based on an iterative process using an initial year estimate for 2000, overlaying estimates for
1999 and 2001, respectively with new data, and then re-balancing. In the past year, some analysis derived
from the Eora database has been published in the African Economic Outlook (AfDB 2014) and the World
Investment Report (UNCTAD 2013).

As such, the Eora dataset allows for an approximate replication, albeit at a somewhat lower level of
precision, of the kind of analysis undertaken for other countries using the WIOD or TiVA databases.
Appendix 1 provides a more detailed discussion of the development of different MRIOs, and Eora
specifically. In terms of key indicators, this report draws on the methodologies first developed by
Hummels, Ishii, and Yi (2001) in measuring vertical specialization and in turn formalized by Koopman,
Powers, Wang, and Wei (2011) (and later Koopman, Wang, and Wei 2014) to derive some of the most
commonly used trade-in-value-added indicators, including domestic and foreign value-added, as well as
value added embodied in other country’s intermediate inputs – i.e. forward and backward integration
(see Appendix 2). Thus far most of these indicators have only been available publically for developed and
other emerging economies through the WTO-OECD TiVA database and the WIOD database (both released
in 2013).

2.2. Scope of coverage: geographical and sectoral
In order to provide a meaningful context for comparative analysis with the five SACU countries, 14 ‘peer
countries’ in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America have been selected. For each of the five
SACU countries, decomposed value-added measures (using f.o.b. prices, in current USD) are provided
over 11 years (2000, 2006, and 2011) and placed next to peer countries in order to provide a relevant
context for these countries’ GVC integration. The peers include:

3
   Backward linkages in the Francois et al. (2013) database serve as a reasonable proxy for the domestic value added embodied
in exports, as the share of re-imported intermediates is generally negligible. This analysis draws on input-output data available
from the GTAP dataset.
4 This is the condensed version of Eora with countries that have more than 26 sectors in their input-output or supply-use tables

having their accounts simplified. However, this does not apply to Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, which all have just
26 sectors even in the expanded Eora database.
5 In comparative analysis with the WIOD dataset, Eora was found to provide broadly similar results when calculating foreign and

domestic value added, albeit with a slight upward bias (which is to be expected as the greater number of highly heterogeneous
developing countries, many of which have been subsumed in WIOD’s rest of world matrix) (UNCTAD 2013).
                                                                                                                               4
           Southern African Development Community (SADC) neighbors with resource-rich economies:
            Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia
           Other African countries that have been reasonably successful at integrating into GVCs: Kenya,
            Mauritius, and Rwanda.
           A selection of Asian and South American low- and middle-income countries with economic and/or
            geographical structures that are similar to one or more SACU country: Argentina, Bolivia,
            Cambodia, Chile, Lao PDR, Paraguay, Peru, and Thailand.

Key sectors for each country are also analyzed. Here selection drew on whether the relevant sector was
tradable, as well as how significant they were as export sectors (an overview of this is provided in Section
3.1 and Appendix 3). Based on Eora’s 26-sector classification system6, the following fourteen sectors were
selected for closer consideration for each of the SACU countries:
    1. Agriculture
    2. Fishing
    3. Electrical and machinery
    4. Financial intermediation and business services
    5. Food and beverages
    6. Hotels and restaurants
    7. Metal products
    8. Other manufacturing
    9. Petroleum, chemicals, and non-metallic minerals
    10. Post and telecommunications
    11. Textiles and wearing apparel
    12. Transport
    13. Transport equipment
    14. Wood and paper

2.3. Assessment of reliability of Eora data at the national and sectoral level
In most cases Eora results provide a reasonably accurate estimate for key indicators of GVC
competitiveness at the country level, and of relative performance of different sectors, both within a
country and in relation to comparator countries. Further, they are likely to provide a largely reliable
approximation of the sectoral decomposition of value added and the direction of value-added trade, as
well as trends for these indicators over an 11-year time period (especially as all three data-points are
derived from the same source and methodology). Thus, in the absence of national input-output tables
(IOTs) and supply-use tables (SUTs), and despite uncertainties (particularly at the sectoral level), Eora
provides the best available and internationally comparable dataset for calculating key value-added trade
indicators, though they are best complemented by more nuanced sectoral analysis drawing on alternative
methodologies (e.g. producer surveys, firm-level analysis, and case studies).

However, a few caveats relating particularly to the accuracy of the Eora data are in order. Firstly, it is
important to bear in mind that Eora’s MRIO tables are modeled based on existing sources – national
accounts data, Comtrade import and export data, among others – when national input-output or supply-
use tables were not available. Further, in order to achieve the MRIO’s overall balancing requirements,
raw data on imports and exports has frequently been adjusted, with the overall focus on representing
large data items and fulfilling balancing conditions for large countries. Eora’s optimization approach
attempts to strike a balance between the frequent conflicts between country-wise total exports and

                                                                                                          5
imports and trade balances but this can lead to substantial uncertainties, particularly for small values
(such as for the four SACU countries Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland that have not developed
national input-output tables). Given these slight imbalances, total gross exports are at times marginally
larger and/or smaller than the value added constituting it, and the sum of domestic and foreign value
added as a share of gross exports is generally not exactly equal to total gross exports at the national and
particularly sectoral level. As a result, indicators of domestic, foreign and indirect value as shares of
exports use total exported value added as the denominator, rather than gross exports. This better reflect
the relative importance of foreign and domestic contributions to exported value added7.

In order to provide an indicative assessment of Eora’s reliability, data on exports and imports were
compared to results from the Comtrade database (using ISIC Rev. 3, which was also used to create the
correspondence for Eora). Furthermore the standard deviation of each sector’s non-exported output is
also presented. This can be found in Appendix 4. Based on this comparative analysis, Eora results
presented in this report should be interpreted with some caution.8

Particularly, due to concerns about data quality for the SACU economies, as well as to a lesser extent the
price fluctuations for mineral products, the mining and quarrying sector was omitted from analysis and
dropped from the MRIO, with subsequent analysis based on a 25 sector summarized table for each
country9.




7 The Eora Frequently Asked Questions provide an explanation for the causes of these imbalances: “data on country‐wise total
exports and imports fundamentally conflicts with global trade balances. One cannot achieve a balanced global multi‐region input‐
output table whilst at the same time respecting data on exports and imports. This means that in a real MRIO table, either
balancing conditions must be violated or raw data mis‐represented.” Under ideal balancing conditions, national ratios of Gross
National Expenditure + exports versus Gross Domestic Product + imports should be 1, i.e. in an IO table the total of all inputs
to a sector a given sector (i.e. the column values) should equal the total value of that sector’s outputs (i.e. the row values).
However, due to data conflicts, this is in most cases a few per cent more or less than 1.
8 Eora developers state that “results will generally be uncertain at the sectoral level and for small sectors, but not necessarily

uncertain for small countries, especially not for small countries with high-quality IO data” (Lenzen et al. 2013, p. 39).
9 In the case of Botswana, however, diamonds are classified under manufacturing and is, therefore, included in the analysis

3. SACU EXPORTS AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRATION IN GLOBAL TRADE NETWORKS

Before analyzing value added trade and participation in GVCs, it is worth profiling briefly the nature of
exports for the SACU countries and their integration into global trade networks. Moreover, as the analysis
of value added trade remains an inexact science, particularly for smaller countries (i.e BLNS). Therefore,
there it is useful to get a broad picture of potential GVC participation from the available aggregate trade
data.

3.1. Overall trade integration
Trade openness – or trade share of GDP – is a standard measure to assess the importance of trade to a
country’s economy, and by extension, its integration with global markets. Figure 1 shows trade openness
plotted against national wealth (measured as the log of GDP per capita). Traded shares of GDP increase
as countries grow wealthier, although regardless of income level small countries tend to have a larger
traded share of GDP than large ones – this is because large countries trade more internally, while small
countries tend not to have sufficiently large domestic markets. Figure 1 shows that most SACU countries
trade above the level that their incomes alone would predict, with Lesotho and to a lesser degree
Swaziland among the most trade-dependent countries in the world. Given they have relatively similar
populations as Lesotho and Swaziland and large mineral exports, Botswana and Namibia are actually
substantially less integrated into global trade. South Africa, meanwhile records a relatively low degree of
trade openness in regional terms, but still remains above the level of many of its peers, including China,
Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Overall the region sits in the middle between the highly integrated East Asian
economies and the poorly integrated South American ones.

3.2. Overview of main traded sectors
The SACU countries can be characterized as having two types of exporters. First, Botswana and Namibia,
rely heavily on the mining sector (especially diamonds in the case of Botswana and Namibia) and the
exports of raw materials (especially agricultural goods and food/beverages in the case of Namibia).
Second, Swaziland and Lesotho have narrow but well-developed industries that drive most export
earnings: in the case of Swaziland it is sugar and (related) concentrated beverage syrups; in Lesotho it is
apparels and textile. South Africa sits somewhere in the middle, with a large share of exports in mining

                                                                                                         7
(iron ore, gold, platinum, diamonds) but also a well-developed agricultural and manufacturing export
sector. Table 1 provides a breakdown of exports by broad industry classification for each country.
Thinking about traditional GVCs (vertically integrated production), the most relevant sectors are
manufacturing as well as some within agriculture. Here we see that while Botswana and Namibia appear
to have large shares of exports in manufacturing, this is mainly explained by the classification of diamonds
in the manufacturing sector; removing this tells a very different story. In the case of Botswana, diamonds
and crude materials account for more than 85% of total exports; in Namibia it is around 45%. Namibia
does, however, have substantial exports in manufacturing and machinery. South Africa is also fairly
skewed toward commodity exports, although it still has a large share of manufacturing exports. Swaziland
is highly concentrated in food (sugar) and processed sugar in the form of Coca-Cola syrup (classified under
chemicals). Lesotho, by contrast, looks quite different from the rest of the region, with more than 60% of
exports in manufacturing.

Turning to imports, Table 2 shows that manufactured goods account for a much larger share of imports
than for exports in the region (with the exception of Lesotho). Botswana’s figures are again skewed by
diamond imports (for aggregation and trading); excluding these, Botswana again appears to be
significantly less integrated in manufacturing trade in relative terms than other countries in the region.
Other notable differences across countries include the much higher share of machinery and transport
equipment imports in South Africa and Namibia and the much higher share of food imports in Lesotho
and Swaziland.

3.3. Proxying GVC integration: trade in intermediates
Going beyond the broad sectoral classifications, we can also look at trade trends with respect to how
goods are normally used – e.g. as inputs into another production process (i.e. intermediate goods) or as
end products for businesses or consumers (i.e. consumption goods). The trade in intermediates is
fundamental to GVCs, who basic concept is “importing to export” or I2E as Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzales
(2013) call it. One country (for example South Africa) exports parts that are incorporated in the exports
of another country (for example Germany). This single flow of intermediate goods is the basis of two key
measures of supply chain integration, which help understanding better the role of a country in GVCs: on
the sales side, it indicates that a country’s exporters are selling into a GVC. On the sourcing side, it
indicates that the country is buying from a GVC. Patterns on the buying side provide information on the
source of technology transfer and the type of GVCs a country is likely to join. This ultimately affects the
growth of domestic value added since it affects the nature of the intra-firm know-how applied via GVCs.
Patterns on the selling side indicate, instead, the likely exposure to demand shocks. We can distinguish
three types of buyer roles in GVCs: for production of intermediate inputs in the value chain, for final
production destined as exports, and for assembly. The main supplier functions are also three: supply of
turnkey components, supply of other inputs, and supply of primary inputs (see Figure 2).
                                                                                                                     9

Figure 3 provides an aggregate view on the share of intermediates in SACU trade. We can see that share
of intermediates in exports varies substantially across countries and over time. With the notable
exception of Lesotho, all SACU countries have more than half their exports in intermediates. Botswana
records more than 90% of exports in intermediates, but this is skewed by the categorization of diamonds,
which alone accounts for more than 70% of exports. Both Lesotho and Swaziland show substantial
declines in the share of their exports in intermediate goods – in the case of Lesotho, the share of
intermediates fell dramatically from almost 50% in 2000 to just 12.2% in 2012. But while intermediates
tend to proxy for production chain integration, in the case of Swaziland and Lesotho, the decline in
intermediates is actually likely to be the result of GVC integration. Specifically, it is the result of
participation in the apparel GVC, where both countries specialize in final stage assembly. Indeed, as
shown in Table 3, apparel exports – where Lesotho, in particular, became concentrated in the 2000s, are
largely consumer products (rather than intermediates) and Lesotho and Swaziland have the lowest share
the intermediates in exports among all peer countries.

In the case of South Africa, the share of intermediates in total exports fell slightly between 2000 and 2012.
This comes despite a significant increase in the share of intermediates exported in the transport
equipment sector (up from 13% to 22%). Similarly, intermediate exports have grown rapidly in the food
and beverages sector (up from 15% to 23%), but South Africa still sells more consumer food and
beverages products than most peers, perhaps indicative of a strong GVC position in this sector. South
Africa’s virtual exit from global GVCs in apparel and footwear may be evidenced by the decline in
intermediate exports from close to 10% in 2000 to just 1.6% in 2012.

Botswana’s high share of intermediate exports is clearly distorted by diamonds. The sector-specific data
in Table 3 shows that Botswana has among the lowest share of intermediate exports across virtually all
sectors. Namibia shows a similar trend, with the one exception being their small electronics sector, which
experienced a strong shift toward intermediate products (while Botswana’s exhibited the opposite shift).

Integration matters as much for imports as exports. Data in Figure 3 shows that the majority of peer
countries increased the share of imports in intermediate goods. In SACU, by contrast, only South Africa
increased imports of intermediates. The other four countries experienced declining relative imports of
intermediates, some significantly so: Botswana’s intermediates fell from 60.8% of imports in 2000 to just
42.9% in 2012; Swaziland’s fell from 53.8% to 47.9%. Overall, SACU countries, with the exception of
Lesotho, come out lower than most peer countries in their reliance on imported intermediates. Again,
the situation varies substantially by sector, although Botswana and Namibia fall well below the peer
average in every sector10.

3.4. Positioning in global trade networks
To get a further sense of the region’s links into global trade networks, we can look at measures of network
centrality. In Table 5, we report two measures of local centrality along with two measures of global
centrality:
     Local centrality refers only to the first order links of each country (neighbors), namely outward
         “Node Degree” and “Node Strength”, where the former measures the centrality in terms of the
         number of markets reached by SACU countries and the latter the intensity of exports.
     Global centrality measures describe the characteristics of nodes’ neighborhood, and in particular
         assess the extent to which a country trades with partners that are themselves important
         exporters. “Out-closeness” is a measure of how close a node is with respect to all other nodes, in
         terms of intensity of export relations. It therefore provides a measure of the relevance of links.
         “Eigenvector centrality”11 stresses the relevance of nodes, i.e. it is important to assess if a node
         is connected to central players or to peripheral ones. Specifically, a node's eigenvector centrality
         is determined by the eigenvector centrality of its neighbors, so that their centrality is also taken
         into account. In general, countries displaying high value of eigenvector centrality are the ones
         which are connected to many other countries which are, in turn, connected to many others. The
         largest values correspond to countries in large and cohesive (high-density) sub-networks.

Table 5 presents the results of network centrality measures for SACU for overall trade intermediates and
four key sectors that tend to be traded in GVCs: agri-food, apparel, automotive, and electronics12. In
terms of local centrality, the results indicate that SACU ranked 14th out of 216 countries included in the
Comtrade database in 2010 in the Node Degree Index and 39th in the Node Strength Index, suggesting
that the region is the top-trading partner for a sufficiently large number of exporters but the intensity of
trade volumes is only moderate. It has also improved its relative importance since 2000, while relative
strength declined slightly. In terms of global centrality, SACU still ranks well but somewhat lower than for
local centrality, with an Out-Closeness ranking of 41 (down 6 places from a decade earlier) and an
Eigenvector Centrality ranking of 34. Sectoral rankings are broadly in line with the overall ranking,
although the region ranks notably lower in apparel in both local and global centrality and notably higher
in electronics (as well as agri-food global centrality).

Table 6 compares South Africa’s centrality indexes in 2010 with those of 20 peer countries. The results
for total trade suggest that South Africa performs relatively well, but with the exception of Node Degree,
tends to be at the lower end of comparisons with BRICS and East Asian peers.

Finally, network representations help visualize the complexity and heterogeneity of actors and trade links
in GVCs. Figure 4 and Figure 5, visualize the network reporting the strongest flow for each node. The most
connected countries – the central nodes, as they are the main trade partner for several countries – are
the “roots” of the tree, distinguished from the peripheral countries – the “leaves.” The size of the node
reflects a country’s strength or centrality in the network. The thickness of links reflects the weight of the
value added relation. Larger bilateral trade flows are portrayed by closer distances between nodes.
Ideally, we would like to present the network using trade in value added data. However, such data are
not available yet for a sufficient number of countries. Instead, we present the network for trade in
consumption13 goods (Figure 4) and intermediates (Figure 5).

In the case of SACU14, trade in consumption goods provides a sense of where the region sells its end
products and where it is most linked into GVCs in terms of its backward integration (i.e. where it sources
from). Here, we see the strongest links are with the EU trade network based around Germany. Figure 4
shows that SACU (mainly South Africa) is an important node linking some other regional economies into
the European trade network. It also shows that while SACU is a significant player in the European regional
trade network, it is has less direct links into Germany than trade partners like Eastern Europe and Turkey
(as illustrated by its positioning further from Germany) and its level of trade is lower (as illustrated by
thinner connecting lines).

The story is a bit different for intermediates (Figure 5), where China is demonstrably more central to trade
for more countries than in consumer products. Here, SACU is primarily linked into the Chinese production
network. Although the region is notably distant from the core of the Chinese network, it appears to play
an even stronger role in intermediates as a regional node for Southern Africa.

4. STEPPING INTO GVCs: MEASURING EXPORT VALUE-ADDED IN SACU

Section 3 of this note provided an initial overview of the scale and nature of integration of SACU countries
in global trade networks. The analysis of trade in intermediate goods provided an initial view on SACU
countries’ trade in the types of products that generally typify GVC trade. Up until this point, however, we
have been considering only data on “gross trade” – i.e. we have not considered the “value added trade”
that is at the heart of analysis of global value chains. In this section, the analysis hones in more on GVC
trade by isolating value-added trade from our traditional (gross) trade figures; it is followed in the
remaining sections by further analysis of the nature of GVC trade.

4.1. Why understanding (domestic) value added is important in studying GVCs
One of the major implications of the growth of trade in fragmented global production networks is the
inflation of aggregate export figures. This results from the double and triple counting of intermediates as
they cross over national borders in the process of coming together to form an end product. For example,
a Korean semiconductor that is incorporated into an ipod will be counted as a Korean export when it is
shipped to Thailand to be assembled into an internal drive, and then again in Thailand’s exports as the
drive is shipped to China for final assembly, and then again from China as it is exported as a finished ipod.
As a result, understanding a country’s gross exports as well as exports of domestic value-added is
important for understanding trade performance and GVC participation. It provides an insight into the
critical issue of how trade performance contributes to the domestic economy in terms of output, industry
linkages, and employment.

Indeed, what matters most for a country is not gross exports (which may include a significant share of
foreign value added via imported inputs) but the domestic value added (DVA) embodied in gross exports.
Figure 6 exemplifies the decomposition of gross exports for the auto industry. Domestic value added
consists of value added created in the auto industry, value added created in other sectors supplying the
auto industry, and of re-imported intermediates (which have been previously exported).

Figure 6: From gross exports to domestic value added: decomposition of gross exports in the auto industry




Source: Taglioni and Winkler (2014), based on Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzales (2013).


A country’s ability to benefit from GVCs is best shown by the evolution of its DVA embodied in gross
exports over time (see Box 2). At the industry level, DVA consists of value added created in a specific

                                                                                                            16
industry itself, value added created in other domestic sectors supplying this industry, as well as previously
exported intermediates re-imported from abroad for use in a given industry. In simple terms, an increase
in DVA embodied in gross exports over time signifies greater value addition within the country itself. As
a function of productivity, it is associated with a country’s breadth, variety and sophistication of tasks and
activities (Taglioni and Winkler 2014a). Beyond the likely welfare and employment implications, this also
has a broader significance for trade policy.15

 Box 2: Domestic and foreign value added: substitutes or complements?
 Operating in GVCs is fundamentally about global trade integration – this means not only exporting within
 production chains but also making use of imported parts and components. Thus, while nominal domestic value
 added (DVA) is ultimately the measure of aggregate success for any country, the level of foreign value added
 (FVA) embodied in a country’s exports is an important measure of GVC integration.

 Mathematically, in percentage terms, DVA and FVA are substitutes – if a country increases its FVA from 40% to
 50% of exports that necessarily means that DVA has declined from 60% to 50%. But that does not mean that
 maximizing DVA share should be the primary goal, particularly if it achieved through an import substitution
 strategy that results in producers having to accept lower quality or higher priced inputs (or simply inputs that are
 incompatible with those required by GVC-oriented buyers). In this case, maximizing DVA share comes at the
 expense of total volumes, as domestic producers may experience declining competitiveness in global markets
 and may be unable to participate in GVCs.

 From a dynamic perspective, therefore, DVA and FVA can be seen as complements. Access to quality and cost
 effective imported inputs raises firm competitiveness, resulting in higher exports and therefore higher nominal
 DVA. Over time, technology spillovers from imported inputs may also result in some goods and services becoming
 competitively produced in domestic markets, leading to a productive substitution of imports for domestic supply,
 and potentially even higher DVA share.


4.2. Is domestic value added increasing in SACU countries?
All five SACU countries have been able to grow their DVA in gross exports, albeit at different rates.
Figure 7 examines compound annual growth rates of DVA embodied in gross exports16 in the five SACU
countries as well as their comparators both from 2000 to 2011. Among the five SACU countries, Lesotho
has recorded the largest annual increase at 13% followed by South Africa and Namibia (12%) and
Swaziland (11%). Lesotho also performs well in relation to its comparators. Only Bolivia, Lao PDR, and
Zambia have seen a larger increase in DVA over the eleven-year period. The performance of the four
leading SACU countries is comparable to that of Argentina, Paraguay, and Rwanda. By contrast, Botswana
lags behind significantly at just 5% CAGR – in fact, Botswana’s growth in DVA is the lowest among all 19
countries.

in predicting the impact of exogenous shocks on welfare or employment.

Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the fastest rates of DVA growth, such as Lesotho and Rwanda, occurred
in those economies that started exports from a very low base and which also have a low share of DVA
embodied in gross exports as a share of GDP (Figure 8). Here, SACU countries still show relatively weak
performance relative to peers. Only South Africa (increase from 16% to 18%) is among the leading
countries in the group of comparators, though it is far eclipsed by Thailand (where exported DVA as share
of GDP grew from 38% to 44%). Botswana saw a decline in its DVA as a share of GDP to 4%, with only
Rwanda having a lower rate. Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland saw marginal increases from a low base
suggesting that their largest export sectors (which experience strong DVA growth) may have relatively
low rates of domestic value addition. Interestingly, the largest increases between 2000 and 2011 were
registered in Zambia, Thailand, Argentina, and Bolivia – all of which are relatively large producers of
metals and/or commercial agriculture.

To start understanding what may be behind the DVA performance in a country, it can be useful to
compare trends in DVA with trends in the development of gross exports (the latter reflects the standard
measure of exports). This is show in Figure 9. Here, we see that growth in DVA has largely tracked gross
export growth for the five SACU economies, as well as for most comparators. However, for both Botswana
and Lesotho gross export growth has been faster than DVA growth (by 2% and 3%, respectively),
suggesting that exports from sectors with lower rates of domestic value addition have been growing more
rapidly. This may be indicative of increasing GVC participation, but it may also simply reflect changing
composition in the export basket (see Box 3).

Looking at the share of DVA in gross exports (in addition to their relative growth) is also critical to
understanding the nature of exports and of GVC integration. Figure 10 highlights significant differences
among SACU countries in this regard, as well as significant changes over time in some countries. While
Lesotho (52%) has the lowest share of DVA among the entire set of peers and Swaziland is among the
lowest (63%), the rest of the region has DVA shares of exports between 70% and 85%, generally in line
with the peer countries, although somewhat on the lower end. All BLNS countries had declining DVA as
share of exports – in Lesotho’s case a striking 16 percentage point decrease, and 7 percentage points for
Botswana. The 11-year time period 2000 to 2011 largely covers Lesotho’s integration into the textile and
apparel GVC (facilitated in part by AGOA and its third-country fabric provision), most likely explaining the
scale of the change over the time period. Among comparators, Argentina and Tanzania, and to a lesser
degree Kenya also saw substantial decline in DVA as share of exports, while Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand,
and Zambia saw significant increases.

 Box 3: The challenge of interpreting DVA results
 As noted earlier, what matters ultimately for a country is growing DVA (in nominal terms) over time, regardless
 of the relative share of DVA. But from the perspective of understanding GVC participation and performance, the
 interpretation of high or low levels of DVA growth is not always that obvious. While we want to see increasing
 DVA, rapid integration into global production chains is likely to result in lower DVA as a share of gross exports. In
 fact, evidence of decreasing DVA a share of gross exports can be indicative of participation in longer and more
                                                                                                                    20
 sophisticated value chains in which more imported value added is in turn being re-exported (Taglioni and Winkler
 2014b). While increasing DVA may reflect growth in the services economy, which tends to have short value chains
 and high values of exported DVA as a share of exports.

 Moreover, DVA growth is affected by important factors that are not linked directly to GVCs (at least not the
 variety of GVCs associated with vertically fragmented production). Most notably for SACU and other developing
 countries with large agriculture and natural resource exports, growth in commodity exports and changing global
 commodity prices will shape DVA measures significantly (for example, extractives exports may have high DVA,
 despite weak links to domestic labor markets and supply chains). Increasing DVA can also signify increasing
 quality of exports (higher unit prices) regardless of whether these exports are within GVCs. And so changing
 sectoral composition of the export basket will have a significant impact on the DVA measure.

 The figure below provides a basic overview of the some of the different situations that may explain various DVA
 outcomes, based around: i) the level of DVA to gross exports; and ii) the growth of DVA to gross exports. This
 underscores the importance of going beyond the aggregate analysis to understand better the factors shaping
 DVA performance, and the degree to which they are shaped by GVC participation and position. At minimum, it
 highlights the need to look at data at the sectoral level. Beyond this, assessing sectoral structure and performance
 at a qualitative level is likely to be important in order to interpret the results effectively.

 Note that in the case of the analysis presented in this note, minerals exports have been excluded, so at least
 some of the effect of natural resources exports on the DVA figures is controlled for in the results presented here.




4.3. Where is DVA growth coming from? – sectoral assessment
Performance at the sectoral level has been highly heterogeneous and can reveal a bit more about the
particular sources of DVA growth. Table 7 summarizes for each of the five SACU countries the five non-
mining sectors contributing the most to overall DVA for the year 2011, including the sectoral compound
annual growth as well as the DVA in exports as a share of total exports. In terms of their overall DVA in
exports, it is striking – if not entirely surprising – how much more DVA as share of total exports is
contributed by services sectors. Examining individual countries, this disaggregation suggests that
Botswana’s overall stagnation is in part attributable to slower growth in manufacturing sectors. Similarly,
the pace of Lesotho’s DVA growth is greatest in services sectors, although these are starting from a very
low base. In Namibia, the leading sources of DVA growth are predominantly in food processing and
manufacturing. South Africa, on the other hand, has a relatively balanced level of growth across its
leading sectors. This sectoral disaggregation by country is expanded in Appendix 5.

Figure 11 compares DVA growth rates for two sectors that are important in most SACU countries –
Agriculture and Food & Beverages – with those of peers. For the first of these – Agriculture – the SACU
countries are, with the exception of Botswana, towards the middle, with DVA growth ranging from 9%
(Lesotho) to 16% (Swaziland). Looking over the most recent five years (2006-2011, not shown in the figure
below), Lesotho’s growth of 30% far exceeds all other countries. The highest performers in agriculture
tended to be the least developed comparator countries, Zambia (24%) and Lao PDR (22%), with the
middle-income countries in the sample generally achieving growth rates between 5% and 15%. For the
Food and Beverages sector, the SACU countries again perform in the middle, with Namibia and South
Africa having the highest overall performance (12%). While Lesotho and Botswana lag at 8% annual
                                                                                                                     22

the highest performers are the less developed comparators Zambia (28%), Bolivia (19%), and Lao PDR
(16%); but low income countries also showed the lowest growth, including Cambodia (3%) and Tanzania
(4%).

Complementing the sectoral DVA growth with data on DVA share of total exports over time in these
sectors can provide further insights into GVC developments. Figure 12 shows these results for the
Agriculture and Food & Beverages sectors. In Agriculture, Swaziland saw a large increase in DVA share of
gross exports, from 75% to 86%. This was the second largest change in any country and, if the data is
correct, it would most likely reflect changing composition of agricultural exports. Lao PDR experienced
the largest growth in DVA share (15 percentage points), while Zambia and Cambodia also showed large
growth in its DVA share. The SACU countries all tended to be in the lower half of the comparator group
in terms of DVA share, indicating that their agricultural exports make greater use of imported inputs.

For the Food & Beverages sector, South Africa has by far the highest share of DVA among the SACU
countries (at 85% in 2011), while the rest of the region showed relatively low levels of DVA. Both
Botswana and Lesotho experienced large declines in DVA share over the decade and Swaziland, while
experiencing growth, showed the second lowest DVA share among all peers (at 61%, just after Botswana
at 60%). The findings suggest that domestic processing in BLNS increasingly relies on imported inputs,
most likely (in the case of this sector) from intra-regional sources.

For tourism, proxied through the Eora “hotels and restaurants” sector (see Figure 13), Lesotho, Swaziland, and
Namibia have all seen rapid growth (16%-20%), while South Africa and Botswana (13% and 11%, respectively)
experienced relatively strong growth but still trailed most peers. In terms of DVA share of gross exports (

                                                                                                            24
Figure 14), however, there are stark differences in the region. South Africa shows the highest DVA among
all peers (near 95%) while the rest of the region trails most peers. Swaziland (61%) and Lesotho (62%)
have particularly low levels of domestic value added in tourism.

The textiles & apparel and transport equipment sectors (see
Figure 15) provide a useful comparative overview of the manufacturing sectors that tend to be most GVC-
oriented on a global basis. For textiles & apparel, the five SACU countries look broadly similar to East
Asian and South American comparators and ahead of most African peers, with all five achieving annual
compound DVA growth at or near 10% (Swaziland lags at 8% and Namibia leads at 15%, but from a small
base). For the transport equipment sector, Swaziland (17% growth) has been the fastest growing country
among all comparators, other than Kenya. Again, however, this comes from a very small base; Botswana
has also experienced strong growth (14%) in DVA. The other three SACU countries all rank towards the
middle of the table, with growth in DVA between 9% and 10%.

In terms of DVA share of exports (
Figure 16), Botswana, Lesotho, and Namibia have seen their exported DVA as a share of total sectoral
exports decline in both manufacturing sectors – in some cases quite substantially. For example, Lesotho’s
DVA embodied in gross exports as a share of gross exports in textiles fell from 66% to 53% and Botswana’s
from 71% to 60%, while Lesotho’s fell in transport equipment from 68% to 49% and Botswana’s from 64%
to 54%. This suggests these value chains may have grown in length and complexity, with less value added
in country, and/or that Lesotho and Botswana’s tasks have become lower value-added. South Africa and
Swaziland in both sectors have remained reasonably consistent over the decade, although South Africa’s
DVA share is substantially above that of Swaziland in both sectors. It is worth noting that relatively low
DVA shares in these sectors may indicate greater GVC participation. For example, South Africa’s DVA

                                                                                                             25
share in automotive (55%) is similar to that of countries like Thailand and Argentina, both of which have
significant automotive sectors, while other countries with limited automotive sectors show higher DVA
shares.

5. GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN PARTICIPATION AND POSITIONING

The analysis of trends in value-added trade give some insight into how SACU countries are integrating
into GVCs, but the analysis still remains a step removed from actual GVC trade. In this section, we use the
Eora database to calculate recently developed indicators on GVC participation and positioning.

5.1. GVC participation – introduction and overall index
A country’s level of participation in GVCs can in part be assessed based on both its forward and backward
integration:
     Forward integration, or indirect value added (IVA) –refers to a country’s share of value added
        embodied in other countries’ exports – i.e. producing intermediates that you export to other
        countries, who will then add further value and export them as finished products or further stage
        intermediates.
     Backward integration, or foreign value added (FVA) – is the share of foreign value added in
        embodied in a country’s exports – i.e. intermediate inputs imported from other countries that
        you then add value to and export as finished products or further stage intermediates.

Both forward and backward integration matter, but neither should be inherently maximized. As discussed
in Box 3, the products involved and the qualitative nature of the integration determine the benefits that
accrue from it. Backward integration provides access to quality inputs, which contributes to downstream
competitiveness; it also has significant potential to deliver productivity spillovers through access to global
frontier technologies. As such, backward integration tends to be particularly important for developing
countries as it links to a number of measures of structural transformation. But taken to the extreme,
backward integration may crowd out local production and limit domestic value addition. Similarly,
forward integration is an indicator of integration into value chains and also provides opportunities to
benefit from technology spillovers. But the desirability of forward integration depends a lot on what is
being exported and where you sit on the value added chain. High levels of forward integration in
developing countries can often be associated with higher resource dependency and is negatively linked
to measures of diversification and structural change (AfDB 2014).17 On the other hand, countries like the
US and Japan have high forward integration by selling leading edge technologies (with high value added)
into the early stage of global production processes.

Figure 17 reports the GVC participation index for SACU countries and peers in 2000 and 2011, based on
data from the Eora database. The GVC participation index combines the measures of forward and
backward integration18, each of which will be elaborated on in more detail in the next section. The index
is intended to indicate the extent to which a country participates in vertically integrated production
(Koopman et al. 2010). The higher the foreign value added in gross exports and the higher the value of
inputs exported to third countries and used in their exports, the higher the participation value. This tends
to favor small, open economies, so it is perhaps unsurprising that Lesotho stands out as the most GVC-
integrated of all peers, particularly given what we know about the development of its apparel sector in
the 2000s. Lesotho’s GVC participation measure increased by more than 50% over the decade. Other
countries that show significantly growing GVC participation include Tanzania, Rwanda, and Zambia. The


17 Domestic value added and foreign value added by definition should equal to the total sum of exports and thus - as the corollary
of DVA - a declining share of domestic value added in total gross exports will by definition result in increased foreign value added
as a share of exports. Due to the balancing considerations outlined earlier, this does not hold completely for the Eora dataset.
18 The index combines FVA and IVA, both as a share of gross exports

                                                                                                                                 27
South American and (surprisingly) East Asian peers also experienced declining GVC participation. What is
notable from the review of peer countries is that while those countries which are dependent on
commodity exports fare well in terms of DVA, they perform less well when measuring GVC participation.

5.2. What is driving GVC participation? – forward versus backward integration
But while the GVC Participation is a useful initial indicator, what matters much more are the components
that make up this index. Figure 18 reports backward and forward integration as a share of gross exports
for SACU and peer countries in 2011, and gives a perspective on what is driving the broad measure of
GVC participation. This is followed in Figure 19 with an illustration of growth in forward and backward
integration over the decade. It shows that, overall, SACU countries tend to be slightly less forward
integrated than peers and slightly more backward integrated; but with the exception of Lesotho, growth
in both forward and backward integration is trailing many peers. Reviewing each country briefly:
        Botswana: More forward integrated (41%) than backward (28%), although forward integration is
         likely to be distorted by diamonds, as is suggested by the very low growth over the past decade
         (1%). Backward integration is relatively high, but growing slowly.
        Lesotho: Highest level of backward integration (48%) and highest growth (20%) among all peers;
         forward integration much lower (18%) and trailing most peers (although growing rapidly),
         reflecting focus on assembly stage of apparel manufacturing.
        Namibia: Slightly above average level (28%) and growth (14%) of backward integration, while
         forward integration remains limited (19%).
        South Africa: Below average backward integration (17%), which is common for larger countries
         (although Thailand’s backward integration is 28%); forward integration moderately high 33%.
         Growth is moderate in both FVA and IVA.
        Swaziland: High level of backward integration (42%) but among lowest forward integration
         among peers (17%); growth in both FVA and IVA among the lowest of peers.

5.3. Sectoral drivers of GVC participation
At the sectoral level, there is considerable heter ogeneity among these countries’ growth rates in foreign and
and indirect value added (see

Figure 20). For Botswana, foreign value added increased the most in transport equipment (18%), along
with metal products and wood and paper (17% each). As was the case for DVA, FVA in financial
intermediation declined substantially (-15%) while other manufacturing and agriculture were stagnant.
In Namibia, the largest growth in foreign content was in the metal products (20%) and electrical
machinery and transport sectors (19% each); financial intermediation also showed a sharp decline in FVA.
For Lesotho, growth in foreign content was highest in services sectors (especially hotels and restaurants,
post and telecommunications, and transport). Swaziland showed a similar pattern of strong growth in
services FVA (with the exception of decline in financial intermediation), but showed much weaker growth
in other areas. For South Africa, FVA increases were largest in agriculture and services sectors, while
manufacturing FVA growth was modest.

Financial intermediation and agriculture consistently shows the lowest FVA as a share of gross exports
while transport equipment shows the highest foreign content (see Appendix 6). Other manufacturing
sectors, including electrical and machinery and food and beverages also show relatively high foreign
content across the region.

Growth in value added exports embodied in third countries’ exports (indirect value added) came across
a broad range of sectors, with agriculture (except Botswana) and services particularly strong. In Botswana,
the most rapid growth in IVA came in transport and communications, followed by tourism, while most
other sectors were stagnant or in decline. In Namibia, Swaziland, and Lesotho growth in IVA was relatively
strong across the board, although the rates of growth were substantially higher in Lesotho. A similar story
of broad sectoral IVA growth can be seen in South Africa.

Looking at performance in individual sectors is useful but runs the risk of obscuring the bigger picture,
particularly as sectors vary substantially in their contributions to GVC participation across the countries.
Figure 21 aggregates sectors according to the OECD’s classification of technology content in sectors. This
aggregation gives a better sense of where foreign content embodied in GVCs is coming from across the
SACU countries and the type of sectors where its GVC exports are feeding into. This is critical for
understanding the potential of generating spillovers from GVC participation. The data on foreign value
added shows that Swaziland and South Africa (and to a lesser degree Namibia) gain most of their foreign
value added embodied in exports from manufacturing sectors, with a substantial amount coming from
high technology sectors. Indeed, these countries compare very favorably to peers, although trail
substantially behind Thailand (driven by large FVA in the electrical and machinery sector) and Argentina
(FVA in transport equipment). In the case of Swaziland, the high technology FVA is coming mainly from
exports embodying foreign content in the electrical and machinery sector, while in South Africa it comes
from both electrical and machinery and the transport equipment sectors. From the perspective of
facilitating technology spillovers, Lesotho’s imported content is among the least favorable across all peer
countries.

                                                                                                         31
In terms of IVA, the story is similar, although the differences are less stark across countries. What is
notable for SACU and just about all peers is that the profile of their forward contribution to GVCs is much
less technology intense than their backward integration. This allows for some tentative conclusions about
relative positioning in GVCs (see Section 5.5). That said, contribution to services exports of other
countries appears to be significant, which may represent interesting opportunities for learning and
upgrading.

5.4. Geographical drivers of GVC participation
Understanding the direction of forward integration (the selling side of GVCs) is important for identifying
potential sources of shocks a country may face (see Appendix 7) 1920. For South Africa, the most important
destination is Germany, followed by the UK and Netherlands. This underscores the continuing reliance
on European demand in GVC-oriented sectors. The BLNS does not register as a significant source of IVA
for South Africa. For Botswana, Israel – presumably as a destination for diamonds and other minerals –
makes up over 30% of Botswana’s IVA, followed by the UK, Germany and Norway (all of which grew their
share from 1996 to 2011 at the expense of regional neighbors). For Lesotho, the largest share of IVA is in
the “rest of world” sector, followed by Belgium and Germany. Namibia also shows a strong link to the
European market, with IVA highest in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium.

Similarly, understanding the source of foreign value added (the buying side of GVCs) is important, in this
case for identifying the source of technology transfer and the type of GVCs a country is likely to join. This
ultimately affects the growth of domestic value added since it affects the nature of the intra-firm and
arm’s length transfer of know-how and the country’s ability to absorb tacit knowledge (i.e. business
models and all other types of knowledge that cannot be codified) and/or the knowledge embedded in
the imported inputs. Data on FVA sources for SACU countries is also available in Appendix 7. For South
Africa, FVA sources are spread across the three main global poles, with Germany as the largest
contributor, followed by the US and China. The questions for South Africa (which requires further
assessment) are: i) whether integration with more technologically advanced nations produces a premium
in terms of growth of the domestic value added embedded in exports; and, ii) whether distance matters
for the rate of growth. The latter is important since tacit knowledge is likely to flow more easily over
shorter distances and – assuming that the latter produces more spillovers – distance and trade costs,


19 These figures are similar but not identical to those derived from the I2E index ( Baldwin and Gonzalez-Lopez 2013).
20  Here, (as for sectoral disaggregation), results should be treated with caution: in some cases statistical discrepancies (i.e. the
RoW sector) is among these countries’ largest destination for intermediates. In SACU, this is the case with Lesotho. Further, trad e
flows within the SACU region are very poorly tracked (including by Comtrade).
                                                                                                                                  32
particularly those affecting the services sector, may matter for the ability of countries to boost domestic
value added via GVCs.

For the BLNS, the distance issue is less relevant – here, South Africa dominates as a source of
intermediates. Where South Africa’s trade flows are measured in Eora, it is by far the largest exporter of
FVA, making up 60% of FVA imported into Botswana, Swaziland, and Namibia (it is not included for
Lesotho). For Botswana, the other main sources of FVA have traditionally been the Netherlands, US, and
Germany, with China emerging as a leading FVA source in 2011. Re-exported intermediates from South
Africa to Lesotho are not reported and as a result China and Chile, followed by India and Taiwan are the
main sources of backward linkages. Namibia also sources over 70% of foreign value added from South
Africa, followed by Germany and the US. As is the case for Botswana, China has become increasingly
important as a provider of inputs while inter-regional sourcing (besides South Africa) remains minimal.
Swaziland also depends on South Africa for the bulk of its FVA, followed by Germany and the US, though
their share has been declining as China’s has increased.

5.5. Assessing GVC positioning
As discussed earlier, what is ultimately more important than participating in GVCs is capturing value that
facilitates sustainable growth and higher-quality employment. This depends, in part, on a country’s
positioning within a GVC. It can be upstream (production of inputs at the beginning of the value chain) or
downstream (production of goods and services towards the end of the value chain) depending on its
specialization. Countries specialized in upstream activities produce the raw material or the intangibles
involved at the beginning of the production process (e.g., research and design). Countries concentrated
in downstream tasks specialize in the assembly of the final products or in customer services. Finally,
countries involved in activities at the center of the value chain focus on the standardized labor-intensive
manufacturing jobs. Again, it is not always obvious where a country would ideally want to be positioned
– it depends very much on the value chain in question. For some value chains, most of the value is
captured upstream, for others downstream; and in some cases both. Generally, speaking, mid-stream
activities (“at the center of the value chain”, as described above) are least likely to be in a position to
capture significant value.

“Upstreamness” of a country’s specialization can be measured by its “distance to final demand” (Antràs,
Chor, Fally and Hillberry, 2012) – i.e. the distance in terms of number of production stages between the
production of good i in country c and final demand21. Evidence suggests that only a few countries have
managed to move downstream. Most countries have increased their upstreamness because the overall
length of value chains has increased with the fragmentation of production. Moreover, the offshoring
process that lengthens GVCs tends to affect more the early stages of production, although a new wave
of services offshoring has been taking place in recent years (Taglioni and Winkler, forthcoming). A final
useful metric is to combine import and export upstreamness to compute the domestic length of the value
chain. A positive gap indicates that exports are relatively more downstream (or “closer to final demand”)
compared with imports. This is the case in economies where the manufacturing sector has been a key
source of export-led growth, such as China, Japan, and Thailand. Conversely, a negative gap indicates that
a country’s export profile is more upstream than its import profile. This is the case in economies whose

   Measured as                                  , Ddj is the distance to final demand in terms of number of production stages in country
d and industry j. These are summed up over all country-industry (d,j) combinations who use inputs from industry i and country
c using φcdij as weights. φcdij is the fraction of production from industry i in country c that is purchased as an intermediate good
by industry j in country d.
                                                                                                                                     33
exports are concentrated in agriculture products and primary commodities, such as Australia, and New
Zealand. Or it may be the case that the country is a home to a sophisticated consumer market and
therefore an intensive importer of finished consumer goods, rather than being a reflection of its exports,
such as the United States.

Figure 22 shows that most SACU countries export in upstream positions, relatively far from the final
consumers, and show a “negative” domestic GVC length. The exceptions here are Botswana (distorted by
the short value chain of diamonds) and Lesotho (final stage apparel assembly). Turkey, Thailand and
Mauritius appear to show a pattern of importing relatively upstream and exporting at a more
downstream stage, thus indicative of a positive domestic GVC length. By contrast, the South American
peers export further upstream than SACU and all show negative domestic GVC length. Between 2000 and
2012, almost all peer countries’ exports became more upstream (probably as a result of increasing
fragmentation of global production), but South Africa, Swaziland, and Namibia moved further upstream
than most.

The relative structure of value chains and country positioning obviously varies considerably by sector.




Table 8 shows export upstreamness in key sectors in 2012. SACU countries appear to export slightly more
downstream than peers in agriculture and food and beverage sectors and significantly more so in
transport equipment, while they are positioned around the peer average in the other manufacturing
sectors. No SACU countries stand out as being appreciably more upstream or downstream across the
sectors, although Swaziland is quite a bit more upstream than SACU peers in food and beverages.
Analogously, the data on domestic length of GVCs (Table 9), suggests the SACU countries have longer
domestic chains in agriculture and agriprocessing, as well as transport equipment. But their import
patterns in other manufacturing sectors means that SACU countries generally show negative domestic
length in these sectors, indicating substantially shorter domestic value chains in manufacturing than in
most of the peer countries.

6. SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS

The increasing fragmentation of global production has the potential to offer substantial opportunities for
the five SACU countries: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. Particularly for the
four smaller SACU economies (the BLNS), proximity to and regional trade agreements with the
“headquarter economy” South Africa both augment these opportunities and create risks of “crowding
out”, with South Africa reaping the gains of any investments in the region.

Overall the analysis in this note, which draws extensively on the Eora multi-region input-output database
over an eleven-year time period and including fourteen comparator countries, suggests that the SACU
region is moderately integrated into GVCs. But the scale and nature of this integration varies enormously
by country and sector.

Considering overall trade integration first, the region fares well – less integrated than East Asia but more
so than might be expected given its peripheral location (and more so than South American peers).
However, the nature of integration tends to be biased toward imports, with exports largely commodity
dependent (with notable exceptions of South Africa, Lesotho, and Namibia).

Taking the analysis a step further and looking at trade in intermediates, the picture for the region looks
less optimistic. Here, SACU as whole has a lower share of intermediates in both exports and imports as
compared to peer countries. Moreover, intermediates are declining as a share of exports and imports
(with the exception of exports in Namibia and imports in South Africa). This highlights that the region’s
apparent trade integration remains biased toward commodity exports and consumption imports, with
potentially rather limited GVC participation.

The analysis of network integration highlights that South Africa, at least, remains a moderately important
player in global trade networks and a key regional hub both in consumption goods (where it is linked to
the European market) and intermediates (where it is increasingly linked to China). This data, however, is
based only on gross trade and not value-added trade and so South Africa’s global position in
intermediates is likely to be biased strongly by commodity exports, obscuring its real participation in GVCs.

Lesotho appears to have made the most strides in the region in terms of GVC participation, as evidenced
by rapidly growing gross exports and DVA, and a declining ratio of DVA to gross exports. By contrast,
Botswana fares poorly in measures of DVA growth and GVC integration, showing stagnant DVA and
declining DVA share of gross exports. Swaziland also shows relative stagnation in its performance. South
Africa and Namibia meanwhile show moderate performance, with South Africa in particular showing
fairly strong levels of GVC participation and moderate growth in DVA and DVA share. From a sectoral
perspective performance varies significantly, but what is most notable is that services sectors – and
particularly transport and hotels and restaurants – have in general been growing more rapidly than
manufactured goods.

These results are also mirrored in the GVC participation index, for which Lesotho saw the largest increase
between 2000 and 2011 (from 48% to 70%). Among SACU economies only Namibia improved in this time
period (from 37% to 39%). However, all five countries are – broadly speaking – in the middle range
compared to the list of peer countries.




                                                                                                          36
The region also shows big differences across countries in terms of the nature of this integration. Overall,
South Africa is the only country in the region showing relatively strong forward integration in GVCs;
Botswana also shows relatively high forward integration, but excluding diamonds, forward integration is
limited. Lesotho and Swaziland, by contrast, show the lowest forward integration among all peers, and
Namibia is also among the least forward integrated countries in the comparison. Lesotho, South Africa,
and to a lesser degree Namibia are well integrated backward into GVCs. Botswana and Swaziland perform
less well here, and both of these countries show stagnant performance over time across both forward
and backward integration.

The direction of forward and backward integration shows the overwhelming dominance of South Africa
as a source country of foreign content for the other four SACU economies, which suggests that they are
more integrated into regional value chains than to global ones (see Keane, 2015). This may also have
implications for access to global frontier technology, and therefore to productivity growth potential.
China has grown substantially in significance, particularly as a source of foreign content. All countries,
however, remain highly dependent on European markets for their forward participation in GVCs.

Finally, the region appears to be positioned relatively upstream in GVCs, in particular South Africa,
Swaziland, and Namibia (while Lesotho is downstream positioned in the apparel GVC). While the region
appears to be better positioned than the South American peers, a clear gap is apparent with countries
like Thailand, Turkey, and Mauritius, which import relatively upstream in GVCs and then export further
downstream. By contrast, most SACU countries import further downstream than they export.

In interpreting these results it is important to bear in mind the importance of the recent commodity
super-cycle on the relative export value of goods and services for commodity-dependent exporters
(including some of the SACU countries). This is likely to explain some of the trends observed, particularly
in relation to growth in forward and indirect value added. These results – particularly in conjunction with
existing sectoral studies on the export growth and diversification efforts of these economies – provide
compelling evidence of the varied pace of GVC integration in recent years in the region, as well as the
heterogeneity across sectors and source and destination countries.

Appendix 1: Overview of Eora and other MRIOs
A growing number of international and MRIO tables are allowing us to analyse sources and destinations
of value that flows through GVCs, identifying the role of countries and industries in supply chains.
Pioneered by Wassily Leontief in the 1940s, these were initially mostly applied to the analysis of national
accounts for individual countries and were later on used primarily for environmental and ecological
analysis (e.g. measuring responsibility for emissions) as well as in regional science (see Miller and Blair
2009 for an overview).

In recent years, national account data has been integrated with bilateral trade data and information
about sourcing of inputs at the industry-level to derive information on use of domestic and imported
inputs, and in turn, where value is added along supply chains provided a new, easily accessible approach
to measuring trade in GVCs (see Figure 23 for an overview).

world economy. Larger circles stand for higher coverage.

Of late, triggered by greater interest in understanding processes of international fragmentation and
global supply chains, numerous empirical papers have been published using existing input-output
databases (especially the forerunner of many recent MRIOs, the Global Trade Analysis Project, GTAP).
Measuring trade in value added via MRIOs has a number of clear benefits (see Ahmad 2013). Firstly, it
provides a crucial tool to understand a country’s actual industrial structure and the national and
international inter-linkages of sectors for developing growth and development strategies, as well as trade
and industrial policies. Secondly, it makes clear how particularly non-tariff barriers (including regulatory
measures) can impact competitiveness and upstream producers. Thirdly, it can help policymakers better
anticipate ex ante the potential impact of macroeconomic shocks. Fourthly, it can allow for calculations
of the ‘job content’ of trade. Finally, environmentally extended MRIOs allow for an assessment of the
impact of trade as it affects ecosystem services.

                                                                                                                            40
MRIO tables are usually constructed through harmonised national supply-use tables (SUTs) and/or input-
output tables (IOTs). These show truncations between domestic industries supplemented by tables
breaking down imports by users, and have increasingly become indispensible for relevant
macroeconomic and trade policy analyses (for an overview see Ahmad 2013, Jones et al. 2013,
Dietzenbacher et al. 2013, Amadou and Cabral 2014). 22 MRIO tables allow for analysis of value
contribution along supply chains, enabling the analysis of sources and destinations of value that flow
through GVCs (for recent examples see Johnson and Noguera, Lenzen et al. 2013, UNCTAD 2013). There
are now a number of global input-output databases that vary significantly in terms of country, sectoral
coverage, time span and approach (see Table 10 below).

The spate of recent MRIO tables greatly improves our understanding of how GVCs function in practice.
They are, however, subject to a degree of uncertainty – as is common with any applications using
accounts data and trade flow data – which is augmented when examining developing counties, where
statistical capacities tend to be substantially worse. Moreover, MRIO tables also suffer from a deficiency
faced in many other empirical approaches to trade flow analysis, namely they are not able to accurately
assess the impact of services. They furthermore are subject to two assumptions that contribute to their
uncertainty, the former of which particularly is relevant for analysing trade flows from developing
countries (OECD 2012). Firstly they assume that all products (for export and domestic use) have the same
import content (proportionality assumption – see Winkler and Milberg 2012) and secondly they assume
a uniform use of inputs among all firms in a sector (homogeneity assumption).

The Eora MRIO dataset, has recently been used for GVC-related analyses in a number of international
reports (UNCTAD 2013, AfDB/OECD/UNDP 2014). It has several advantages to other databases (see
Lenzen et al. 2012). These include:
   1. It is disaggregated into 187 countries (including all SACU members), providing important
        advantages for assessing impacts of consumption and production on relatively poor countries;
   2. It has a historical time series spanning 1990-2011 (soon to be extended to 1970-2011 and
        updated with an approximate two year delay) based on an iterative process using an initial year
        estimate for 2000, overlaying estimates for 1999 and 2001 respectively with new data and then
        re-balancing;
   3. It includes tables of basic prices, as well as two margins (taxes on products and subsidies on
        products) with constant prices to be added soon;
   4. To clarify levels of uncertainty, standard deviation estimates have been calculated for all MRIO
        events;
   5. It is publically available at www.worldmrio.com

In its construction, it was based on the principle of changing to the structure of the original data sources
as little possible for the sake of transparency. Its matrices are based on the use of the following types of
raw data (in order of assumed accuracy):
      input–output (I–O) tables and main aggregates data from national statistical offices where these
          are available;
      I–O compendia from Eurostat, IDE-JETRO, and OECD,
      the UN National Accounts Main Aggregates Database ,
      the UN National Accounts Official Data,
      the UN Comtrade international trade database, and
      the UN Servicetrade international trade database.




                                                                                                                          42
This makes it well suited for dynamic analysis of smaller developing countries not included in other
datasets,23 however should be complemented by more nuanced sectoral analysis drawing on alternative
methodologies.

Appendix 2: Methodology for value-added analysis
The calculation below of the different value added measures comes directly from Koopman et al. (2010)
who provide a full decomposition of value-added exports in a single framework encompassing previous
measures by Hummels et al. (2001) and Johnson and Noguera (2012), among others.

They start with a standard input-output model where each country produces goods in N tradable sectors
(Leontief 1970, Miller and Blair 2009):

X = (I – A)-1Y = LY,…
… X is the 2 × 1 gross output vector for both countries
… A is the 2 × 2 coefficient matrix giving intermediate use of each country’s sector of goods
produced in r.
… I is a 2 × 2 identity matrix
… Y is the 2 × 1 final demand vector for both countries
… L is the 2 × 2 Leontief inverse matrix.

Assuming the case of a 2-region, 1 sector example (i.e. N=1) consisting of Botswana (indexed B) and the
rest of the world (indexed R), the two-country system can be written in block matrix notation as:
              
[  ] = [         ][ ]
        

Value added trade is calculated using V as a 1 × 2 row vector with each element representing the
value added per unit industry output and each element in V gives the share of direct domestic value
added in total output.

One can then calculate the value-added share (VAS) matrix as:

                              0                            
 ≡  = [                ][                    ] = [                    ]
                  0                                


The columns in   denote Botswana’s domestic value-added share of domestically produced products
in a particular sector at home. The columns of   denote the share of the Rest of the World’s value-
added in these goods produced in Botswana. The second set of N columns present value-added shares
for production in the RoW for Botswana’s goods (  ) and RoW value added for goods produced in
the RoW.

The sum along each column must equal unity:

  +   =   +   = u


23In comparative analysis (UNCTAD 2013) with the WIOD dataset, Eora was found to provide broadly similar results when
calculating foreign and domestic value added, albeit with a slight upward bias (which is to be expected as the greater number of
highly heterogeneous developing countries, many of which have been subsumed in WIOD’s rest of world matrix).
                                                                                                                             43
In order to then determine domestic and imported content shares of each country’s production and trade
at the sector level, use gross exports as weight, letting ∗ = ∑  = ∑(  +  )
            0
 = [ ∗      ]                                             ,                                           and
       0 ∗

̂=[(∗ )
E
                           0
                                    ]
          0         (∗ )

Where:
… E is a 2 ×  matrix
   ̂ is a 2 × 2 diagonal matrix
… 

The value-added share by source country for each sector can then be calculated as:


_E       ̂ = [  
       ̂ ≡ E                                   
                                                                  ]
                                     

Each element is the total upstream direct and indirect value added by source country and sector in gross
exports for each sector (thus also including the specific sector itself).

Looking at aggregates and 2 countries (i.e. in the example above) there is no need to define sectoral
shares, so one can just use
           0
 = [ ∗      ]
       0 ∗

and in turn for value-added by source in gross exports:

                           ∗     ∗
VAS_E= VLE = [                                                 ]
                           ∗     ∗

The diagonal elements represent the domestic value-added of each country’s exports; off-diagonal
elements give the foreign value-added embodied in each country’s exports24:

          ∗
DV= [                     ]
          ∗

           ∗
FV = [                     ]
           ∗


Assuming 3 countries (Botswana, Swaziland [indexed S] and RoW) and N sectors, production, value-added
share and sources of value-added in gross exports are as follows:

X = (I – A)-1Y = LY,…
VAS = VL
VAS_E = VLE

24Generalization of Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) vertical specialization measure as the this only caputres foreign value added in
gross exports when only one country’s intermediate goods are used abroad.
                                                                                                                              44
X and Y are 3 × 1 vectors; A and L are 3 × 3; V and VAS are 3 × 3 matrices; E is a 3 × 3 and
VAS_E is 3 × 3.

For aggregate measures, all results continue to hold – can be expressed just by replacing relevant
weighting matrix. Complexity arises from intermediate inputs that cross multiple borders (derivation via
application of expression for inverse of a partitioned matrix).

As before, value-added shares can be applied to gross exports to produce VAS_E (3 × 3).

           ∗           ∗     ∗
VAS_E = [   ∗          ∗     ∗ ]
           ∗           ∗     ∗


Here the sum of off-diagonal elements along a column is the measure of foreign value-added embodied
in a country’s gross exports, i.e.:
  = ∑≠     , or for this 3-coutnry case:

 =    +   

The sum of off-diagonal elements along a row provides information on a country’s value-added embodied
as intermediate inputs in third countries’ gross exports (i.e. indirect value added):

 = ∑≠    ,

Domestic value in gross exports is, as above:

 =   

Sum of all DV and FV should add up to gross exports

To capture country’s position (upstream/downstream) it makes sense to compare its exports of
intermediates used by other countries, with that country’s use of imported intermediates in the same
sectors. If it lies upstream in the global value-chain, it participates in producing inputs for others – then
its IV share of gross exports will exceed its FV share:

                                                                                              
                                                   _ =           +

Appendix 4: Exports and imports for SACU countries - Comparing Eora and Comtrade
This section provides an overview of changes in each of the five country’s aggregate and sectoral exports
between 2001 and 2011 drawing on the Eora database, as this is the source of the value-added analysis.

For Botswana, the Eora data (Table 11) shows a particularly strong increase in the significance of service
exports in the economy. While the Other Manufacturing sector (which is likely to include diamonds) was
the largest in 2001, the two largest export sectors in 2011 were Transport and Hotels and Restaurants.
Eora data suggests a strong increase in both exports and imports in the given time period, with the former
growing at almost 11% annually and the latter at over 30%. Besides the Other Manufacturing sector, the
most important non-services sector is Food and Beverages, which has seen considerable growth (20.8%
p.a.). In terms of imports, the largest sector is the Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products
sector, which has also experienced substantial growth since 2001, followed by Electrical and Machinery.
Financial Intermediation and Business Services is the largest services import sector.

What is most striking when one compares Eora trade data to Comtrade’s data for Botswana (Table 12) is
the fact that Other Mining and Quarrying, which is by far the largest export sector in Comtrade (more
than US$8 billion in exports and 15 times as many exports as any other sector) is completely
underrepresented in Eora, both in terms of trade value and relative significance (it is 6 th with
approximately 45 million in exports). This discrepancy inevitably skews Botswana’s results for any kind of
value-added trade analysis. In terms of imports, the overlap is more significant with the EORA Petroleum
sector aggregated from ISIC sectors 23-27 on Comtrade. Likewise, while Comtrade does not have
information on the four services sectors featured as top ten imports in Eora (Financial Intermediation and
Business Services, Public Administration, Education, Health and Other Services and Construction), there is
an approximate correspondence between some of the other top-ten import sectors if one aggregates
ISIC sectors to the 26-sector Eora format.

Lesotho’s top export sector – Textiles and Wearing Apparel – far exceeds flows from any other goods
sector according to Eora data (Table 6)(Table 13) with the subsequent sectors predominantly consisting
of services (most prominently Transport, Public Administration and Hotels and Restaurants). These
sectors have also grown significantly faster than the textiles and apparel sector. However, the largest
export sector according to Comtrade, Other Mining and Quarrying, is again far less significant on Eora
(Table 13) in Eora its approximate equivalent sector, Mining and Quarrying (which also includes four other
ISIC sectors) has an export volume of approximately US$ 14 million on Eora compared to US$716 million
for Comtrade.

Eora reports the largest import sectors to be predominantly services (Public Administration, Financial
Intermediation, and Transport) – in all likelihood a product of its dependence on South African imports.
Leading goods imports are listed as Wholesale Trade (which is not more clearly specified), Electrical and
Machinery and Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products. Again, the discrepancy to
Comtrade is rather striking– here textiles are by far the largest import product, followed – more
consistently with results from the Eora database- by “Manufacture of Chemicals” and “Manufacture of
Radio and Television.”

For Namibia, the largest three export sectors according to Eora are Food and Beverages, Petroleum,
Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products, Mining and Quarrying and Transport (Table 15). Here
particularly mining and transport have seen remarkable growth over the past years (46% p.a. and 39%
p.a., respectively, since 2001). Subsequent sectors are primarily manufacturing, including Electrical and
Machinery, Transport Equipment and Textiles and Wearing Apparel. Comtrade data again has Other
Mining and Quarrying as the top export sector (Table 9), which broadly reflects the importance of Mining
and Quarrying in the Eora rankings. The subsequent sectors on Comtrade are Manufacture of Basic
Metals, Manufacture of Food Products and Manufacture of Coke and Refined Petroleum.

In terms of Namibia’s imports, the leading imports according to Eora are Electrical and Machinery,
Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products and Financial Intermediation. Again there is a
substantial discrepancy to Comtrade, where the leading import is again related to mining (Mining of
Metal Ores) followed by Manufacture of Machinery and Manufacture of Food Products (which is ranked
6th according to Eora).

For South Africa, the largest export sectors according to Eora for 2011 were – broadly speaking – in mining
and minerals, including the ‘Other mining products’ and ‘Iron and steel products’, followed by ‘Coal and
lignite and non-ferrous metals’ (Table 17). The largest non-mineral-related sector was ‘Transport services’
followed by ‘Other business services’.25 This mirrors the results in Comtrade (Table 18), where the largest
sectors were ‘Manufacture of basic metals’ and ‘Mining of metal ores’, followed by ‘Manufacture of
motor vehicles’, which likely captures ‘Transport services’ and the 9th ranked sector, ‘Motor vehicle parts’.
The other top export sectors are either extractives, such as ‘Basic chemical products’ (6th), ‘Petroleum
products’ (8th) as well as agricultural products (7th). These are all represented in Comtrade as leading
sectors.

Among the leading imports, Eora’s top sectors are ‘Motor vehicles’, followed by the two services sectors
‘General government’ and ‘Communications’, and then ‘Other mining’ and ‘Transport services’. In
Comtrade the leading import sector is ‘Extraction of crude petroleum’ and ‘Manufacture of machinery
and equipment’ followed by ‘Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products’ and ‘Manufacture of
motor vehicles’. While the ranking differs, both Eora and Comtrade demonstrate the centrality of the
extractive and transport sectors both as inputs into further production and into final demand.

25As Eora could draw on South Africa’s own input-output table, there are more sectors available than for the other SACU
countries. However, the analysis in the subsequent sections draws on the summarized 26-sector summary (25, excluding mining
and quarrying).

Swaziland’s largest export sectors are Food and Beverages, followed by Electrical and Machinery and
Transport, Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products and Hotels and Restaurants (Table
19). Together with Education and Health, both Transport and Hotels and Restaurants have been among
the fastest growing sectors (up to 50% p.a.), indicative of the increasing importance of the services
economy. This is broadly consistent with Comtrade data, where Manufacture of Food Products and
Beverages is the largest sector, ahead of Manufacture of Chemicals and Manufacture of Machinery and
Equipment. The other goods in Swaziland’s list of ten most significant exports on Eora – Agriculture, Metal
Products, Textiles and Wearing Apparel and Wood and Paper – are all represented in the top 10 according
to Comtrade data.


                                                                                                                   52
The largest sources of imports according to Eora are Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral
Products, Electrical and Machinery and Financial Intermediation. This is followed by two other services
sectors: Public Administration and Education and Health. When comparing Eora import data for
Swaziland to Comtrade (Table 20), this does create numerous discrepancies. Comtrade data has
Manufacture of Motor Vehicles, Manufacture of Chemicals, Manufacture of Textiles and Manufacture of
Machinery and Equipment as the top goods sectors. As Manufacture of Chemicals is one of four sectors
subsumed in Eora’s Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products sector and Transport
Equipment ranks sixth in the Eora ranking (and third among goods sectors) there is a certain degree of
overlap, though as before the omission of certain sectors of particular importance in the Comtrade
rankings (e.g. textiles) is conspicuous.

As the above analysis shows, there exist substantial discrepancies between Eora and Comtrade, even
when going beyond sectoral trade volumes and examining just the relative significance of different
sectors in terms of total imports/exports. Trade data for SACU countries is notoriously flawed so there is
little guarantee that either source provides an accurate estimate of ‘true’ trade volumes (and initial
cursory analysis of trade data on the SACU statistical portal provides a further set of contradictions).
However, the processes required to create the contiguous Eora database have likely come at the expense
of precision for less globally significant economies, including SACU countries.

In this context, Table 22 through Table 25 provides a helpful overview not only of total non-exported
output across time for each of the 15 tradable sectors (23 for South Africa as it has a more sophisticated
IO table), calculated by adding output produced by a sector for use in any domestic sector as an
intermediate and for domestic final consumption (but not for export), as well as the standard deviation.
This provides some indication of the reliability of estimates. As can be seen, standard deviations vary
across sectors, countries, and time26. For example, standard deviations tend to be significantly lower for
services sectors than for mining and quarrying, while the level of uncertainty for Swaziland (over 60% for
2000 values and 30% for 2011) is far in excess of those of the other four SACU countries, where in
aggregate the standard deviation tends to be range from a fraction of 1% (South Africa) to 5% of the
result (Namibia and Lesotho). For each country adherence reports are available describing in greater
detail which data sources have been respected most and least in the final outcome.

  According to the Eora website, standard deviations are calculated where different data sources exist and assigning quality
scores to these. Then, “conflicting data points along with quality scores are run through optimization software which produces a
quality-weighted result.” If two conflicting estimates exist, the researchers first ascertaine – either from written documentation,
or from data source provider interviews – the reliability of the data source, and then assign standard deviations to the two or
more values, with the optimiser then producing a quality-weighted final result.

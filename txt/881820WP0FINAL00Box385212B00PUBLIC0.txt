Abstract: A consensus exists that rising income levels and technological development
are among the key drivers of total health spending. However, determinants of public
sector health expenditure are less well understood. This study examines a complex
relationship across government health expenditure (GHE), sociopolitical risks, and
international aid, while taking into account the impact of national income and fiscal
capacity on health spending. We apply a two-way fixed effects and two-stage least
squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995
through 2010.

Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation
with GHE, and that levels of spending are higher when the government is more stable.
Corruption is associated with less spending in developing countries, but with more
spending in high-income countries. Furthermore, we find that development assistance for
health (DAH) substitutes for domestically financed government health expenditure
(DGHE). For an average country, a 1 percent increase in total DAH or DAH to
government is associated with a 0.02 percent decrease in DGHE. However, we do not
find DAH to nongovernmental bodies (NGOs) is fungible with DGHE. In addition, we
discover that the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where
corruption and ethnic tensions are widespread.

Our work highlights that policy reforms that aim to eliminate corruption are fundamental
to improving the capacity of developing countries to scale up GHE, and to increasing the
efficiency of health care systems in developed countries in containing health care costs.
To minimize fungibility, donors may impose stronger monitoring mechanisms for
corruption. Delivering aid through NGOs may be an option in countries with high ethnic
tensions; however, the ability to do so depends on institutional arrangements and the
capacity of NGOs in individual countries.

                              1.     INTRODUCTION

Rising income levels and technological development are among the key drivers of total
spending on health. However, public sector health spending is likely to be determined by
factors related to governance quality and social risks, hereafter referred to as
‚Äúsociopolitical risks.‚Äù Sociopolitical risks can present serious challenges to emerging
economies that are in the process of economic and political transition. This holds true
because the less developed a country, the more likely that its sociopolitical institutions
will be weak (Mills 2011). Weak governance and social instability limit effective
functioning of health systems and jeopardize the ability of governments to mobilize
health funds. The World Health Organization (WHO) urges low-income countries to raise
tax revenues for health by 2 percent of their gross national product by 2015, and middle-
income countries to increase public funding to extend coverage for poor households
(WHO 2001). In this context, it is useful to examine whether sociopolitical risks explain
public spending on health in the developing world.


Furthermore, many developing countries rely on foreign aid to promote economic growth
and social welfare. Development assistance for health (DAH) grew rapidly during 2001‚Äì
10, at an annual rate of 11.2 percent, contributing to progress toward achieving
Millennium Development Goals (IHME 2012). Nevertheless, there are concerns about
external dependence for health financing (Mills 2011). While an increase in health aid
raises public spending on health, foreign aid also incentivizes recipient countries to
reallocate domestic resources among various sectors. If a government substitutes DAH
for domestically financed health funds, there will be a decrease to that extent of
government‚Äôs contribution to the domestic health budget (Farag et al. 2009).


Developed countries generally have more stable governance, but they also face a need to
contain the growth of public sector health spending (OECD 2010). Since 1970, two-thirds
of the increase in per capita total health expenditure in developed economies results from
increases in government health expenditure (GHE) (Coady and Kashiwase 2012).
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) experts have
proposed various policies that aim to contain health expenditure growth, including
improving efficiency in health systems and public sector management and coordination
(Joumard et al. 2010; Tyson et al. 2012). The effectiveness of these policy tools is likely
to depend on the quality of overall governance. Consequently, investigating how


                                            1
sociopolitical factors contribute to public sector health expenditure in developed nations
should be beneficial to ongoing reform efforts.


This paper assesses empirical linkages between public spending on health with various
sociopolitical determinants and health aid. We break down governance into three
domains ‚Äî government stability, corruption, and democratic accountability ‚Äî and focus
on social risk in relation to ethnic tensions. Because of difficulties scholars have
experienced in assembling data on countries‚Äô sociopolitical environments at the global
level, there has been a lack of systematic analysis of the relationship between governance
and public sector health spending. This study covers 120 countries over the periods 1995
through 2010, thus improving on previous research using smaller samples.


                        2.      RELATED LITERATURE

The standard approach to analyzing aggregate health expenditure looks at how it changes
with national income. This method was pioneered by Newhouse (1977) and developed
further by Leu (1986) and by Hitiris and Posnett (1992). An alternative approach looks at
the political determinants of health expenditure, examining the ‚Äúinstitutions of
government‚Äù and the effects of various political systems (Navarro et al. 2006; Persson
and Tabellini 1999; Shelton 2007; Vatter and R√ºefli 2003).


Our work is related to the second strand of literature. While we investigate political
variables that have previously been studied by others, we use measures for them, which
are available for both developed and developing countries. Looking at high-income
countries, Huber (1998) and Vatter and R√ºefli (2003) use variables for government
stability defined by cabinet stability and by coalition size. Both conclude that a more
stable government is less prone to short-term policy expansions such as guarantees of
increased social expenditure, and that a broader coalition government may keep health
expenditures down through greater stability.


Corruption affects expenditure in that political rents can be obtained from direct
appropriation of tax revenue or favors paid to interest groups (Alesina et al. 2008).
Higher levels of corruption are likely to be associated with higher military spending and
lower public-sector expenditure on health and education (Delavallade 2006; Fosu 2008;
Goel and Nelson 1998; Gupta et al. 2000; Gupta et al. 2001; Mauro 1998; Tanzi and
Davoodi 1997). Further examination finds that greater executive restraint would reduce

                                            2
corruption and thus shift expenditure away from public investment that has low
productivity (Fosu 2010; Keefer and Knack 2007). A separate variable for democratic
accountability has had a varying relationship with health expenditure. Some studies show
democratic societies allocating a higher share of the public budget to health, and others
show veto points curbing social expenditure are exercised in direct democracies (Baqir
2002; Farag et al. 2012; Habibi 1994; Persson and Tabellini 1999; Vatter and R√ºefli
2003).


There is little empirical evidence relating social risk to ethnic tensions. Some researchers
have found that more ethnically heterogeneous societies spend less on public goods,
including health and education (Easterly and Levine 1997; Kuijs 2000). But those studies
have not specifically focused on ethnic tensions.


For external aid, a key question of interest has been whether it is fungible with domestic
revenue sources financing health expenditures. A number of studies report that DAH has
fungibility (Gbesemete and Gerdtham 1992; Murthy and Okunade 2009; Xu et al. 2011).
Fairbank (2013) concludes that the primary factors influencing fungibility for a country
are the number of donors and the importance of aid relative to other national income.
There is some evidence that fungibility is more likely when external aid is provided to
government rather than to nongovernment organizations (NGOs) (Lu et al. 2010). There
is a gap in the literature regarding interaction of sociopolitical risks with fungibility.


    3.      MODELS OF GOVERNMENT HEALTH EXPENDITURE

3.1 Basic fixed-effects regressions
To incorporate health aid in models for government health expenditure (GHE), we start
by specifying a simple relationship:


TGHE=DGHE+DAH_G                                                     (1.1)


where TGHE is total government health expenditure, financed from both domestic and
external sources; DGHE is domestically financed government health expenditure; and
DAH_G is DAH or development assistance for health disbursed to government. DAH
may also be channeled through nongovernmental bodies, and thus we divide it according
to delivery channels as follows:


                                             3
Total DAH=DAH_G+DAH_NG+DAH_U                                                                 (1.2)


DAH_NG denotes DAH distributed to NGOs; DAH_U is DAH that cannot be
disaggregated into recipient agencies. Following this discussion, we separate TGHE and
DGHE and propose a model for each, where we include additional variables for health
aid in the DGHE function to investigate fungibility of aid.


The basic model of TGHE for country i (1, ‚Ä¶, N) at year t (1, ‚Ä¶, T) is the following:


       log Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌªΩ1 log Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌªΩ2 log Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌªΩ3 Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌªΩ4 log Ì†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° +
                 ‚àëÌ†µÌ±ó Ì†µÌºóÌ†µÌ±ó Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ô Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° + ŒµÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°                   (1.3)



                                                        where
                  ŒµÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°                                                  (1.4)

GDPit represents gross domestic product (GDP); GGDit is government gross debt (GGD).
Informalit is the size of the informal sector and Oldit is the share of population age 65 and
over. GGDit measures debt financing. GGDit and Informalit are included to capture
variations in governments‚Äô fiscal capacities. We conjecture that governments that have
borrowed more money and can collect more tax revenue would have more financial
resources to fund health care. We expect a negative coefficient for Informalit since a
larger informal sector will tend to reduce the tax base and hence tax revenue. Oldit is
likely to have a positive coefficient as older people generally consume more medical
resources than young people.

The term Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ô Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° is the term we apply to a set of four variables, namely
‚Äúgovernment stability,‚Äù ‚Äúless corruption,‚Äù ‚Äúdemocratic accountability,‚Äù and ‚Äúless ethnic
tensions.‚Äù Each of these variables is given a score between 0 and 1 (1 indicating the best
performance), which was converted from points assigned by the International Country
Risk Guide (ICRG) (PRS 2012). Definitions for these variables appear in section 4.


The composite disturbance term ŒµÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° is the sum of country-specific effects (Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ñ ), time
effects (Ì†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±° ) measured by year dummies, and idiosyncratic error (Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° ). Country effects
capture a country‚Äôs initial level of spending and persistent heterogeneity, including
characteristics of their health financing and delivery system. Time effects account for

                                                            4
technological progress, global economic crises, and other time-varying factors common
across nations.


The model for DGHE proposed as a counterpart for equation (1.3) has additional
variables for health aid and takes the following form:


                                           log Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌªæ1 log Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° +
      Ì†µÌªæ2 log Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌªæ3 Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌªæ4 log Ì†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° +Ì†µÌªæ5 Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞ª _Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° +Ì†µÌªæ6 Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞ª_Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° +
              ‚àëÌ†µÌ±ó Ì†µÌºîÌ†µÌ±ó Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ô Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±°                         (1.5)


DAH_Git and DAH_NGit represent DAH for government and NGOs, respectively. The
error term Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±° is assumed to follow the same structure as Œµit in equation (1.4). When a
country does not receive any aid (as is the case for 34 percent of country-year
observations), both DAH_Git and DAH_NGit are zero, and DGHEit is equal to TGHEit.
Here we did not transform variables for DAH into logarithms because a zero value for
DAH would become a missing value after transformation. We want to keep both donor
and aid-receiving countries for equation (1.5). We anticipate that DAH to government is
fungible with DGHEit, which will give DAH_Git a negative coefficient.


We use the Hausman test to determine whether a fixed- or random-effects model is more
appropriate (Hausman 1978). For both equations (1.3) and (1.5), the test strongly rejects
the null hypothesis of no correlation between regressors and the disturbances (p-
value<0.001); therefore, a fixed-effects model is adopted throughout this study.


3.2. The instrumental variables approach
While the fixed-effects model accounts for unobservable factors, GDP and GGD could
still be endogenous. For example, if the government were to increase health spending as
part of a stimulus policy, or if the expenditure and debt policies were adopted
simultaneously, there would be reverse causality. Moreover, omitted variable bias could
arise if factors exist that are correlated with both government health expenditure and
GDP. For example, health insurance coverage, which is hard to measure, could bias the
coefficient for GDP upwards if health coverage required greater public financial input
and were better achieved in higher-income countries. A common solution is to use the
ratio of out-of-pocket payment to private health spending to approximate insurance
coverage (Smith et al. 2009). However, this proxy could be endogenous, since public


                                                           5
spending on health is likely to affect out-of-pocket payment. Other omitted variables may
include health technology assessment and cost-containment mechanisms, which are likely
to be more prevalent in advanced economies. The impact of these variables on health
expenditure has been well documented, yet data on them are not available at a global
level (Gerdtham et al. 1992; Tyson et al. 2012).


To address problems of endogeneity, we extended the fixed-effects model and applied an
instrumental variables (IVs) approach. The variable logGDPit is instrumented by the log
of trade openness, measured by the per capita sum of imports and exports. For logGGDit,
we used international liquidity as an IV measured by the number of months of imports
that could be financed with a country‚Äôs reserves. The reasons for choosing these two
variables as IVs are discussed in annex A.


Using the proposed IVs, both equations (1.3) and (1.5) are re-estimated by estimating
two-stage least squares (2SLS) models with year dummies and country fixed effects. The
validity of the chosen IVs is confirmed by a series of tests performed for both models
(see Annex A).


Finally, we interacted the sociopolitical variables with country income group dummies to
assess the relationship between sociopolitical risk variables and government health
expenditure across income groups. Appendix B provides a list of low-, middle-, and high-
income countries included in the sample. The regression results show that only
interactions between the variable for corruption and income group dummies (high-
income countries as the reference) are statistically significant at the 5 percent level; thus,
we added only these to the model.


3.3. The 2SLS specification with a focus on health aid
To further evaluate the fungibility of health aid, we confined the sample to recipient
countries and modified equation (1.5) in three steps. First, we transformed DAH_Git and
DAH_NGit into logarithms to estimate the elasticity of DGHE with respect to DAH.
Second, we replaced logs of DAH_Git and DAH_NGit with logs of total DAH in a
separate regression. Total DAH is calculated in two steps: (a) by summing DAH_Git and
DAH_NGit; and (b) by then adding unspecified DAH (DAH_U) as defined in equation
(1.2) to the sum. Third, we interacted variables for aid with sociopolitical variables and



                                              6
  kept only those with coefficients significant at the 5 percent level. We find that the degree
  of fungibility of health aid varies according to the level of corruption.


  Initially, we assumed both logGDPit and logGGDit to be endogenous, as previously
  discussed; however, the statistical test shows that logGGDit is no longer endogenous. This
  is probably because expenditure policy is less concurrent with financing policy in
  recipient countries. Consequently, only logGDPit is treated as endogenous and
  instrumented by trade openness and international liquidity. As before, we tested the IVs
  and found them valid (see annex A).


  All estimation is undertaken using Stata 12. For the fixed-effects regressions, standard
  errors are adjusted for country clusters. For the 2SLS regressions, calculated standard
  errors are robust to heteroskedasticity and autoregressive process of order one.


                         4.      SAMPLE AND VARIABLES

  The full sample for the fixed-effect model for TGHE includes 120 countries for the years
  1995 through 2010, constituting unbalanced panel data of 1,500 observations. The
  primary data sources used in this study are the following: (a) World Development
  Indicators (WDI) compiled by the World Bank; (b) the ICRG, produced by the Political
  Risk Services (PRS) Group; (c) International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic
  Outlook and International Financial Statistics; (d) the WHO National Health Accounts
  (NHA); and (e) the Financing Global Health 2012 report published by the Institute for
  Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). Table 1.1 summarizes model variables before
  their transformation into logarithms, together with their corresponding data sources. All
  monetary variables are in per capita terms and are expressed in constant 2005
  international dollars.

  The dependent variable TGHE is obtained from a WHO NHA indicator called general
  government expenditure on health (GGHE), which includes both domestic and foreign-
  sourced funds. DGHE is calculated by subtracting DAH channeled to government from
  TGHE. Data on DAH were provided by IHME. We used DAH for health in preference to
  official development assistance (ODA) data because the latter excludes contributions of
  private foundations and NGOs (IHME 2012).
  The size of the informal economy is calculated as the ratio of agriculture to
  nonagricultural output, excluding a nation‚Äôs total health expenditure from the latter to
  avoid endogeneity problems. Sociopolitical risk variables are calculated using the ICRG
  Political Risk Rating data that comprise 12 weighted variables. We selected four of them
  on the basis of literature review as most likely to be related to government health
  expenditure. ICRG experts collect political information and make risk assessments using
  a global standard, assigning points to each variable. See appendix C for a description of
  the rating system and how we convert the points into comparable risk scores on a scale of
  0 to 1. The ICRG defines government stability as the government‚Äôs ability to stay in
  power and accomplish its policy goals. Corruption refers to political and financial
  corruption such as demanding bribes for trade licenses, as well as corruption ‚Äúin the form
  of excessive patronage, nepotism, job reservations, ‚Äúfavor-for-favors,‚Äù secret party
  funding, and suspiciously close ties between politics and business‚Äù(PRS 2012).
  Democratic accountability is measured by how responsive a government is in terms of
  five types of governance: alternating democracy, dominated democracy, de facto one-
  party state, de jure one-party state, and autocracy. Finally, ethnic tensions are measured
  by the extent to which ethnic and linguistic fragmentation contributes to the tension

within a country (PRS 2012). For this study, countries that have a more stable
government, a less corrupt political system, higher democratic accountability, and less
ethnic tensions receive higher scores. Country examples are given in appendix C.

We display the mean values of sociopolitical variables for individual income groups in
figure 1.1. In general, low-income countries receive the poorest ratings and high-income
nations the highest. The largest difference in ratings is detected for corruption, where
emerging economies appear to be considerably more corrupt than advanced economies.
Ethnic tension is an exception: the average rating was not significantly different at the 5
percent level between middle-income and high-income countries.


For empirical estimation, we included the quadratic term for democratic accountability to
capture nonlinearity in government health expenditure. We did not include quadratic
terms for other sociopolitical variables because these were not significant at the 5 percent
level in any model specifications. In addition, we find that multicollinearity is not a
serious issue and discuss this in annex D.

  5.1 Association between sociopolitical risks and government health expenditure
  Table 1.2 presents the results from the TGHE function estimated by the fixed-effects and
  2SLS method. Across models I, II and III, per capita GDP and government debt are
  positively and significantly correlated with TGHE. The elasticity of TGHE with respect
  to GDP is approximately 0.9 and 0.7 in the fixed-effect and 2SLS models, respectively.
  Compared with the 2SLS estimator, the fixed-effect estimator seems to overestimate the
  coefficient on GDP, validating our concern over endogeneity of GDP. Additionally, the
  2SLS model suggests that for an average country, an increase in per capita government
  debt by 1 percent contributes to a 0.27 percent increase in TGHE (p-value<0.01),
  suggesting that debt financing provides financial leverage to expand public spending on
  health. The coefficient on the size of the informal sector is negative and large in the 2SLS
  specifications (p-value<0.01), which fits with our hypothesis that a large informal sector
  keeps government health spending down.

    Among all the sociopolitical variables included, democratic accountability is the most
    important in explaining variation in TGHE. The square of accountability is negative and
    significant, suggesting that the positive association between accountability and TGHE
    weakens when accountability continues to increase. In addition, the 2SLS models show
    that, on average, countries with greater government stability (p-value<0.05) have higher
    TGHE. Interaction terms indicate that in low- and middle-income countries, less corrupt
    governments spend more on health (p-value<0.05); whereas in high-income countries, a
    higher degree of corruption is associated with higher TGHE (p-value<0.05).


    The results for the DGHE function are given in table 1.3. In general, the conclusions are
    identical to those in the TGHE specifications. For international aid, we find evidence of
    the fungibility of DAH to government in the 2SLS models. Here, one (international)
    dollar increase in aid is estimated to relate to a decrease in DGHE by 1 percent (p-
    value<0.01). In contrast, DAH to NGOs is found to be related to an increase in DGHE (p-
    value<0.05).

From model VII we find that DAH to government is fungible with government health
expenditure from domestic sources (p-value<0.01), and the degree of fungibility is lower
in countries with lower risks of corruption (p-value<0.01) and ethnic tensions (p-
value<0.05). Interaction terms show that for an average country included in model VII, a
1 percent increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.02 percent decrease in
DGHE. (The result is calculated as 0.02 percent=-0.14+0.13√ó0.38+0.11√ó0.65, where 0.38
is the mean score for less corruption and 0.65 is the mean score for less ethnic tensions
for 70 countries included in model VII.) However, we do not find evidence of
connections between DAH to NGOs with DGHE. This result differs from the finding
derived from the 2SLS models in table 1.3.

Using the same approach to calculating fungibility of total DAH, and given the mean
score for less corruption of 0.39 for model VIII, we find that a 1 percent increase in total
DAH is related to a 0.02 percent decrease in DGHE. Similar to model VII, model VIII
shows that total DAH is more fungible in countries where corruption is more prevalent.


                                6.      DISCUSSION

Overall, the results support our hypothesis that aggregate income and a government‚Äôs
fiscal capacity explain much of between-country variation in government health
spending. The size of the informal sector is highly significant across all specifications;
reflecting the size of the tax base from which the government raises revenue and collects
social health insurance premiums, it is a determinant of the level of public spending on
health. For emerging economies, this implies that a large informal sector limits the
government‚Äôs ability to mobilize health funds.


After controlling for other variables, variations in levels of government health
expenditure are attributed to country-specific governance variables and health aid, which
are discussed individually as follows.


6.1 Democratic accountability
All models reveal that democratic accountability exhibits a diminishing positive
correlation (that is, an inverse U-shape) with government health expenditure. These
findings counter previous literature reporting democracy as having a linear relationship
with public sector health spending. The diminishing positive correlation may explain why


                                            13
there is mixed evidence on the direction of correlation between democracy and social
spending. In this study, the turning point beyond which democracy is negatively
correlated with per capita government health expenditure is between an ICRG rating of
0.6 and 0.7, for example, 0.92/(2*0.7) for model I in table 1.2 (and similarly for other
models), which is categorized as moderate democracy. This means that a government
with an alternating democracy or autocracy (the lowest and highest levels of political risk
associated with accountability) spend less on health.


The negative correlation between democratic accountability and government health
expenditure beyond the turning point, at a high level of democracy, may possibly be
explained by the separation of power and checks and balances in democratic systems,
which may limit the levels of public spending on health. As defined by the ICRG, an
alternating democracy has an active opposition party and an executive body controlled by
a political party, which serves no more than two successive terms (PRS 2012). In this
system, short-lived administrations may not be willing to make commitments to financial
input into health programs that are less visible or that last longer than their terms.


Autocratic governments are the least responsive type. The leadership of an autocracy is
not subject to an election in which political opponents are allowed to stand (PRS 2012).
In this context, autocratic governments may place little emphasis on social welfare and
population health, and the level of government health expenditure may be lower in these
countries as a result.


6.2 Government stability
The finding that a stable government spends more on health is reflective of the
benevolent behavior of incumbent governments and the increase in spending realized
through compromise. When a regime is able to maintain power, it may have less
incentive to seek rents if it does not need to worry about opposition rent-seeking. This is
in line with the social welfare‚Äìmaximizing model of government behavior, where
officials seek office to advance policies designed for the social good (Pearce 1992).
Analyses previous to ours in 18 OECD countries also find significant improvements in
short-run political performance to occur with greater government stability (Huber 1998).
Our sample includes developing countries, so higher government health expenditure may
also be interpreted as a form of better political performance of a stable government in
emerging economies.


                                            14
Our results counter some previous work reporting stability to be negatively correlated
with health expenditure (Vatter and R√ºefli 2003). Our findings are not unexpected given
that we use a long time period and look at a large cross-section of countries. Furthermore,
given that we control for democratic accountability, the estimated relationship between
government stability and health expenditure is conditional on the degree of democracy.
Interpretation of the results in this study differs from that of other studies that do not
consider variation in polities.


6.3 Corruption
Our models suggest that corruption in developing countries is associated with lower
spending on health; whereas corruption in high-income nations is linked to higher
government health expenditure. This finding differs from previous findings where
corruption is universally negatively correlated with public sector health spending.
Overall, the empirical evidence to support this finding is limited.


One reason for our finding may be that as a country becomes richer and government
expenditure increases, there may be a diffusion of corruption-related rent-seeking from
capital sectors offering greater opportunities for kickbacks (for example, military and
energy) to areas that traditionally have lower rewards (for example, health and
education). While Mauro (1998) finds that there is a small effect of corruption on
reducing health expenditure, he hypothesizes that health spending on state-of-the-art
medical technology and sophisticated hospital systems may lead to a higher susceptibility
to rent-seeking. Mauro (1998) does not include a subsample analysis by country income
group for the effect of corruption on health expenditure. In addition, in a corrupt high-
income country, the amount of the marginal product of health expenditures may be
relatively low, either because the actual volume of health care is low or because care is
inappropriate. In this context, more public resources are required by high-income corrupt
governments to achieve a given health outcome. It may also reflect the inability to
develop a political consensus on how to contain costs, which is captured by the variable
for corruption.


6.4 International aid
We find that the substitution of DAH to government for domestically financed
government health spending is greater in countries where corruption is prevalent. This
result persists when DAH to government is replaced by total DAH. Farag et al. (2009)

                                            15
estimate that a 1 percent increase in donor funding for health is associated with a 0.14
percent decrease in government health spending in low-income countries and a 0.04
percent decrease in middle-income countries. For this study, model VIII estimates that
the elasticity of DGHE with respect to total DAH to be -0.025 percent for an average
low-income country (awarded a mean score of 0.35 for ‚Äúless corruption‚Äù), and to be -
0.015 percent for an average middle-income country (with a mean score of 0.42 for ‚Äúless
corruption‚Äù). Farag et al. (2009) conclude that a higher degree of fungiblity in low-
income countries could be due to a higher share of donor funding within government
health spending. Our findings show further that this relationship is likely also to be due to
a higher degree of corruption in low-income countries.

We find mixed evidence on the linkage between DGHE and DAH to the
nongovernmental sector: these are either complementary or have no connection. This
result is different from that of Lu et al. (2010), who report that DAH to NGOs is related
to increases in government health expenditure from domestic sources. This discrepancy
could be due to different samples, functional forms, and estimation methods applied in
the two studies. Another key finding of our study is that the degree of fungibility of DAH
to government increases with the degree of ethnic tensions. Further investigation is
needed to explore this issue.


Note that we conducted robustness checks (see appendix E) and found that the results for
sociopolitical variables and health aid are consistent across various model specifications.
An exception is that when we excluded the variable for democratic accountability, the
coefficient for government stability became insignificant. More work is required to
examine this relationship between democratic accountability and government stability
and their interaction effect on government health expenditure.


           7.      POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION

Our work highlights that for emerging economies, corruption is an important determinant
of health expenditure. Reforms that aim to eliminate corruption are fundamental to
improving the capacities of developing countries to scale up health resources. A recent
IMF report (2012) emphasizes that corruption in government increases the incentives of
firms to operate in the informal economy. Hence, tackling corruption may lead to a
reduction in the size of the informal sector, thus increasing tax revenue for domestic
health expenditure in poor countries.

                                             16
The positive relationship between corruption and government health expenditure in
advanced economies underlines the importance of tackling corruption as part of a cost
containment agenda. Corruption could reflect impact of health sector lobby groups, poor
incentive structures, inability to work across competing political interests, or challenges
in strategic purchasing. Studies have shown that fraud and corruption are among the
leading causes of inefficiency in health care systems (for example, Gee et al. 2011), and
governments of developed countries have employed initiatives such as the 2005
European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network and the 2010 United States
Improper Payment Elimination and Recovery Act to address such issues. Such initiatives
could serve as models for developing countries, but innovative solutions should also be
sought.

Our finding that DAH to government is likely to be more fungible in corrupt countries
suggests that corruption will have more negative impacts in countries where foreign aid
makes up a larger proportion of public sector health spending. Moreover, the
disproportionate decrease in domestically funded government health expenditure
associated with health aid to corrupt governments raises the question of whether foreign
aid per se reinforces corruption. A large body of literature suggests that corrupt
governments use aid less effectively (Burnside and Dollar 2000; Masud and Yontcheva
2005). For these reasons, donors might consider imposing strong monitoring mechanisms
for more corrupt countries. Donors might also proactively make aid conditional on
recipient governments committing to anticorruption reforms, securing domestic health
funds, and achieving preset performance targets. Such approaches have been adopted by
the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria (WHO 2001).


The level of ethnic tension in aid-receiving countries deserves attention since it is
correlated with greater fungibility of DAH to government. Delivering aid through the
nongovernmental sector may be an option in countries with high ethnic tension; however,
the feasibility of this kind of approach depends on institutional arrangements and the
capacities of NGOs in individual countries. In cases where health aid is targeted for
specific ethnic groups, we recommend that donors track government health expenditure
to ensure that the recipient governments do not reduce domestic resources that finance
care for marginalized groups.




                                            17
Finally, several limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. The variables for
sociopolitical risks that we have used may be potentially biased as these are based on
subjective judgments of ICRG experts. Future efforts to validate our conclusions should
consider using the World Bank‚Äôs Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
database, which includes variables for periods since 2005 for transparency,
accountability, and corruption. Future work should also consider obtaining more and
higher-quality data for country sociopolitical factors for exploring subnational analyses.
In addition, current tracking of DAH is based on imperfect primary data, aggregated
across many sources. Further work might also develop more sophisticated models, able to
relax some of the assumptions necessary in our estimation methods.

In conclusion, we have identified the roles of various sociopolitical factors and
international aid in explaining between-country variation in government health
expenditure. Our results add to existing evidence on the relationship between fiscal
capacity and government health expenditure, and provide new insights about
sociopolitical variables. We have also provided additional evidence related to
international aid, including the fungibility of aid for health and its relationship to the
degree of corruption and ethnic tensions in recipient countries.

       Annex A The Assumptions and Tests for Instrumental Variables (IVs)

This study uses trade openness and international liquidity as an IV for per capita log GDP
and government gross debt, respectively. Trade openness has been found in the literature
as a consistent driver of GDP growth and thus is correlated with the log of per capita
GDP (Baldacci et al. 2007). The assumption here is that transactions between an
economy and the rest of the world are unlikely to affect government health expenditure
directly, other than through their impact on GDP. Conceptually, this instrument may be
valid for looking at health spending because health care exhibits economic characteristics
of low portability and labor intensiveness, and plays a limited role in international
business. As evidence of the last quality, in the OECD countries the level of trade in
health care accounts for less than 1 percent of total health expenditure in the public and
private sector (OECD 2011).


International liquidity is potentially a good instrument for government debt because
external public debt is serviced by international reserves (Rowland and Torres 2004). In
this context, the variable for international liquidity is related to government debt, and we
conjecture that international liquidity is not correlated with government health
expenditure except through debt financing.


For each 2SLS specification, the Kleibergen-Paap (K-P) (2006) underidentification test
strongly rejects the null hypothesis that the model is not identified (p-value<0.01). The
weak identification test generates a large robust K-P rk Wald F statistic, showing that the
instruments are strong, with the size distortion smaller than the 10 percent for the 5
percent level test. Moreover, the F-test on excluded IVs produces a p-value of nearly
zero; thus the IVs are jointly significant in all functions.


For specific models, the endogeneity test of logGDPit and logGGDit in models II, III, V,
and VI (tables 1.2 and 1.3) rejects the null hypothesis that the endogenous regressors can
be treated as exogenous at the 5 percent level. This confirms our hypothesis that GDP and
government debt are endogenous. Similarly, the endogeneity test of logGDPit in models
VII and VIII shows logGDPit is not exogenous. The excluded IVs for logGDPit in models
VII and VIII are verified using the Sargan-Hansen test (Hansen et al. 1996) of
overidentifying restrictions. The null hypothesis is that the excluded IVs are not
correlated with the error term and are rightly excluded from the main equation. The result
cannot reject the null hypothesis (p-value>0.1); thus the proposed IVs are valid.

                  Annex B Country Classification by Income Levels

Using the World Bank classification, we classify a country as low-income if its per capita
gross national income (GNI) was US$765 or less in 1995, as middle-income if it was
between US$766 and US$9,385, and as high-income if it was more than US$9,385. The
1995 criterion is used because 1995 is the first year of the study period. Table B.1
presents countries included in the sample.

             Annex C Calculations of Variables for Sociopolitical Risks

The ICRG Political Risk Rating system comprises twelve risk variables (termed
‚Äúcomponents‚Äù by ICRG); the present study uses four of these. Using a global standard for
country risk assessment, ICRG experts assign points to each component monthly or
annually. Points range from zero to a maximum numerical value that depends on the
component‚Äôs weighting in the overall risk of a country (PRS 2012). The maximum points
for all 12 components total 100, and lower points in a given component indicate that the
country exhibits higher risks. The maximum number of points that can be assigned to
‚Äúgovernment stability‚Äù is 12, while the maximum for ‚Äúdemocratic accountability,‚Äù
‚Äúcorruption,‚Äù and ‚Äúethnic tensions‚Äù is 6. Several components are further divided into
subcomponents; in these cases, ICRG experts will first assign points to each
subcomponent and then sum up the points to generate the final point total for that
component. ICRG‚Äôs principles for assigning points are described in column 3 of table
C.1. For more on ICRG methodology please refer to their website, accessed at
http://www.prsgroup.com/ICRG_Methodology.aspx.


Our analysis used ICRG points data for each of the sociopolitical variables. To make the
selected components comparable, we converted the average annual points to a scale of 0
to 1 (hereafter referred to as scores) for each component. For example, if a country was
awarded 10 points for government stability, its score would be 0.83 (=10/12). This
removes the weights assigned by ICRG and gives a standardized annual country risk
rating for each sociopolitical variable.

      Annex D Examining Multicollinearity among the Independent Variables

Table D.1 presents the correlation matrix of sociopolitical variables based on the full
sample. We found that the highest correlation is between corruption and democratic
accountability (0.52). We tackled this issue in sensitivity analysis, appendix E.

To further investigate the issue of multicollinearity among sociopolitical variables, we
estimate variance inflation factors (VIF) for all regressors. A general rule is that there is
evidence of multicollinearity if the largest VIF is greater than 10 or if the mean VIF is
considerably larger than unity (Chatterjee and Hadi 2006). The results from the basic
model suggest that the largest VIF (6.56) is observed for the log GDP per capita and the
overall mean VIF of 3.07. The VIFs for sociopolitical risk variables range between 1.37
and 2.22, which are considerably below 10.

                              Annex E Sensitivity Analysis

The sensitivity analysis assesses whether any of the findings in this study are robust to
different specifications. In particular, our primary models show that corruption is
associated with higher government health spending in high-income countries, a finding
that could potentially be controversial and thus requires further investigation. To validate
this finding, we first exclude the variable for democratic accountability and its quadratic
term. This is necessary as the pairwise correlation between ‚Äúdemocratic accountability‚Äù
and ‚Äúless corruption‚Äù is the highest (0.52, see table D.1) among all pairs of sociopolitical
variables. Excluding ‚Äúdemocratic accountability‚Äù would reduce multicollinearity. Second,
we account for outliers by excluding countries where per capita government health
expenditure from all sources (TGHE) fell in the top 5 percent (Austria, Denmark,
Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, and United States) and bottom 5 percent (Democratic
Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Niger, Pakistan, and Sierra Leone) of the sample
average over the study periods. This reduced the full sample size from 120 to 108
countries.


The above two strategies were applied to models III and VI, respectively, and new
coefficient estimates for sociopolitical covariates are presented in table E1. Models III.A
and VI.A exclude variables for democratic accountability; models III.B and VI.B exclude
both outliers and variables for democratic accountability. We find that the coefficient on
‚Äúless corruption‚Äù is negative and significant at the 5 percent level across alternative
specifications, which is consistent with the results derived from the primary models. As a
side result to this exercise, we found that the coefficient on ‚Äúgovernment stability‚Äù
became insignificant at the 5 percent level for models III.A, III.B, and VI.B.


We also wished to further investigate the finding from the primary models that DAH to
NGOs could be either complementary or have no connection with DGHE. We conjecture
that this inconsistency is due to different measures for DAH. For sensitivity analysis, we
assume that DAH to unknown recipients went to governmental sectors, and rerun model
VII (renamed as model VII.A here). We replaced the original variable for DAH to
government (DAH_G) with a new variable termed DAH_GU, calculated as
DAH_G+DAH_U (see equation [1.2] for notations). In this case, domestically financed
government health expenditure was recalculated using the formula, DGHE=TGHE-
DAH_GU. We called this new dependent variable DGHEreit and used its logarithm form
(logDGHEreit) as a new dependent variable. Moreover, we assumed that all unspecified

                                            30
DAH went to nongovernmental bodies. In this case, we added DAH_U to DAH_NG and
generated a new variable for DAH to NGOs. We then re-estimated model VII and
denoted it as model VII.B. Unlike the results in the first case, the calculation of the
dependent variable remains unchanged.


The new regression results are given in table E.1. In general, the sign of the coefficients
on variables for DAH are consistent with the original models. Coefficients on DAH to
government remain significant, while the one on DAH to NGOs is still insignificant at
the 5 percent level. We adopted the same strategy to re-estimate model V in which DAH
is measured in levels rather than in logarithms. We obtained the same result as the
primary model, namely, DAH to NGOs complements DGHE. Therefore, our conclusion
is that mixed evidence does indeed exist on the relationship between DGHE and DAH to
NGOs.

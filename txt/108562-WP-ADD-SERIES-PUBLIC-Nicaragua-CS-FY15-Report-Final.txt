I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Nicaragua perceive the Bank Group;

      Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Nicaragua regarding:
           Their views regarding the general environment in Nicaragua;
           Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Nicaragua;
           Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
              knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
              Nicaragua;
           Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Nicaragua.

      Use data to help inform Nicaragua country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
From November to December 2014, 298 stakeholders of the WBG in Nicaragua were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President, office of a minister; office of a
parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; consultants/contractors working on WBG-
supported projects/programs; PMUs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs/community
based organizations (CBO); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-
based groups, youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 131 stakeholders participated in the survey (44% response rate).

Some respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency face to
face. Others received and returned the questionnaires via courier, mail or email. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Nicaragua; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in Nicaragua; and the WBG’s communication and information
sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Surveys
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 73%, N=240). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’ 15 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from
those of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, E, G, H, and I. For the weighted
stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix F (page 142).

II. Methodology (continued)
A. General Issues Facing Nicaragua: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Nicaragua
   is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the most important development
   priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty, and how “shared
   prosperity? would be best achieved.

B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): their familiarity with the WBG
   and other organizations, their effectiveness in Nicaragua, WBG staff preparedness to help
   Nicaragua solve its development challenges, the WBG’s local presence, the WBG’s capacity
   building in Nicaragua, their agreement with various statements regarding the WBG’s work,
   and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner. Respondents were
   asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments
   in helping reduce poverty, the extent to which the WBG’s work helps the poorest in
   Nicaragua, and in which sectoral areas the WBG should focus most of its resources.

C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent
   to which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Nicaragua, the extent to
   which the WBG meets Nicaragua’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments,
   the importance for the WBG to be involved in thirty one development areas, and the WBG’s
   level of effectiveness in these areas, such as education, poverty reduction, economic growth
   and public sector governance.

D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked how
   often they use the WBG’s knowledge work, and were asked to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality. Respondents were also
   asked to rate the quality of the most recent LAC Flagship Report.

E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their levels of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly. The
   respondents were also asked whether they think the organization is risk-averse and to rate the
   extent to which the WBG is selective, and the extent to which the WBG promotes private
   public partnerships in Nicaragua.

F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Nicaragua: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Nicaragua and which
   services the WBG should offer more of in the country. They were asked to rate the extent to
   which they believe the WBG has moved in the right direction in the last three years, and the
   significance of the role international development cooperation plays in Nicaragua’s
   development in the near future. .

G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, and were asked to rate WBG’s responsiveness to information requests, value of its
   social media channels, the easiness to find information and to navigate the WBG websites.

   specialization, gender, whether they currently collaborate or previously collaborated with the
   WBG, their exposure to the WBG in Nicaragua, which WBG agencies they work with, their
   geographic locations, gender, and whether they think that the IFC and the World Bank work

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from ministries/ministerial departments, PMUs, and
       consultants working WBG projects were combined, respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
       Respondents from private foundations, NGOs/CBOs, and youth groups were combined
       into “CSO.? Few respondents from the office of the president, office of a minister, office
       of parliamentarian, independent government institutions, and other organizations were
       included in the “Other? category. There were no respondents from trade unions, faith-
       based groups, or judiciary groups.

 Given the large number of respondents specializing in education, cross-sectoral analyses were conducted to
examine if respondents from this sector dominated the overall responses to the multiple choice questions about
Nicaragua’s development priorities and sectoral areas that can contribute to poverty reduction in the country. For
details, please see Appendix G.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Gender of Respondents2
Male and female respondents in this year’s country survey had similar levels of interaction with
the WBG. Approximately three quarters of male and female respondents engage primarily with
the World Bank in Nicaragua. Approximately a quarter of both male and female stakeholders
have projects involving both the IFC and the Bank. They also hold similar views of how well
these two institutions of the WBG work together. Please go to page 130 of Appendix E for more
background information of the female and male respondents in this survey.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents of this year’s Country Survey and those in the FY’12
        Country Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted
        mean in FY’15= 6.9; weighted mean in FY’12 = 6.5)4.
       Stakeholder groups: Respondents from CSOs and media were significantly less likely to
        be familiar with the WBG than respondents from other stakeholder groups.
       Geographic locations: Respondents across geographic locations in Nicaragua had
        statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG.
       Collaboration: Respondents who currently collaborate with the WBG are significantly
        more familiar (mean levels of familiarity = 8.2) with the institution than those who
        previously collaborated with it (mean levels of familiarity = 6.3) and those who never
        collaborated with the WBG (mean levels of familiarity = 6.1).
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Nicaragua, the WBG’s
        relevance to Nicaragua’s development and the institution’s ability to help achieve
        development results in the country.

      Geographic locations: Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar
       views of the country’s direction.
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG professionally tended to be
       significantly more likely to indicate that the country is headed in the right direction than
       those who previously or never worked with the institution.

Development Priority (continued)
     Year comparison: Respondents in the FY’12 Country Survey indicated that the most
      important development priorities in Nicaragua were “basic education? (49%) and
      “poverty reduction? (43%). This year’s respondents indicated that the most important
      development priorities in Nicaragua remain to be “education? (62%) and “poverty
      reduction? (37%).
     Stakeholder groups: Respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks and
      local governments were mostly likely to believe that “education? is the top development
      priority in Nicaragua. However, respondents from ministries/PMUs, and consultants
      working on WBG projects were significantly less likely to think this way.
     Geographic locations: Respondents across geographic locations all agreed that
      “education? and “poverty reduction? are Nicaragua’s top two development priorities.
     Areas of specialization: Respondents who primarily specialized in “education? (14% of
      the sample) were significantly more likely than other respondents to indicate that
      “education? is Nicaragua’s most important development priority.
     Gender: it is worth pointing out that less than 5% of women and men considered “gender
      equity? as a top development priority for Nicaragua.

What Would Contribute Most to Reducing Poverty (continued)
     Year comparison: In the FY’12 Country Survey, respondents indicated that the greatest
      contributors to poverty reduction in Nicaragua were “basic education? (47%) and
      “economic growth? (39%). In this year’s Survey, “education? continued to be seen as the
      top contributor to reducing poverty in Nicaragua.
     Stakeholder groups: While overall “education? is perceived as the greatest contributor
      to poverty reduction in Nicaragua, respondents from ministries/PMUs, local
      governments, and consultants working on WBG projects were significantly less likely to
      see the unparalleled contribution to poverty reduction compared to respondents from
      other stakeholders groups.
     Geographic locations: Respondents across geographic locations all tended to agree that
      “education? and “job creation/employment? would contribute most to reducing poverty in
      Nicaragua.

       live in rural areas? would contribute most to achieving shared prosperity in Nicaragua.
       Yet, men were significantly more likely to indicate than women that “better

Greatest Weakness (continued)
     Year comparison: Respondents in the FY’12 Country Survey indicated that the WBG’s
      greatest weakness in its work in Nicaragua was being “too bureaucratic in its operational
      policies and procedures? (29%), whereas a plurality of this year’s respondents indicated
      that the WBG’s greatest weakness in its work in Nicaragua was “not collaborating
      enough with stakeholders outside the Government? (23%).
     Stakeholder groups: Respondents from CSOs were significantly more likely to indicate
      than respondents from other stakeholder groups that the WBG’s greatest weakness in its
      work in Nicaragua was “not collaborating enough with stakeholders outside the
      Government? (23%).

Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts

        working too slowly? (27%).
       Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from
        academia/research institutes/think tanks were significantly more likely to indicate that
        slow WBG-assisted reforms should be attributed to “political pressures and obstacles,?

Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
      Stakeholder groups: There were significant stakeholder differences in respondents’
       ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness in eighteen of the thirty one sectoral areas. In most
       cases, respondents from local governments gave the highest ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness, whereas respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks tended
       to give significantly lower ratings. Please see appendix B (page 87) for more details.
      Geographic locations: There were no significant geographic differences in respondents’
       ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness any of the thirty one sectoral areas.
      Gender differences: There were significant gender differences in respondents’ ratings
       for the WBG’s effectiveness in seventeen of the thirty one sectoral areas. Female
       respondents always gave significantly higher ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness than
       male respondents. Please see appendix E (page 130) for more details.
      Areas of specialization: It is worth pointing out that respondents who specialize in
       “education? (14% of the sample) gave significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s
       effectiveness in “public sector governance/reform,? “anti corruption,? and “health? than
       respondents who specialize in other areas.
      Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 72) that primarily
       informed stakeholders responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of
       “don’t know? if they did not have exposure to the WBG’s work in certain development
       areas.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Nicaragua, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Nicaragua.
       The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at transport; and,
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/ reform.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Nicaragua, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness food security;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

      Stakeholder groups: There were significant differences in respondents’ levels of
       agreement with three statements about the WBG (listed below). In most cases,
       respondents from CSOs had significantly lower levels of agreement than respondents
       from other stakeholder groups:
             The WBG takes decisions quickly in Nicaragua
             The WBG disburses funds promptly
             Working with the WBG increases Nicaragua’s institutional capacity
       *It is worth pointing out that when it comes how promptly the WBG disburses funds,
       respondents from local governments had the lowest levels of agreement among all
       respondents.
      Geographic locations: Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar
       levels of agreement with all the following statements.
      Gender differences: Female respondents had significantly higher levels of agreement
       with two statements below than male respondents.
           The WBG’s approvals and reviews are done in a timely fashion
           The WBG takes decisions quickly in Nicaragua

Appendix F: Responses to All Questions by Year19
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY15 data and the total number of
respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.
FY ’12 Number of comparable respondents = 226  FY ’15 Number of comparable respondents = 112
By weighting, FY12 and FY15 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Zimbabwe perceive the World Bank Group;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Zimbabwe regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Zimbabwe;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Zimbabwe;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               knowledge work and activities, and communication and information sharing in
               Zimbabwe;
            Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s future role in Zimbabwe.
       Use data to help inform Zimbabwe country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In April-May 2014, 246 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Zimbabwe were invited to
provide their opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President; the office
of the Deputy President; government ministers; parliamentarians; government employees and
civil servants; consultants/contractors working on World Bank Group-supported projects/
programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local
government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; the
financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 183 stakeholders participated in
the survey (74% response rate).
Respondents either completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency or they
received the questionnaire via courier and returned it accordingly. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Zimbabwe; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group
(WBG); the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Zimbabwe; and the WBG’s communication
and information sharing in Zimbabwe.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Zimbabwe: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Zimbabwe is
   headed in the right direction (socially and economically), what they thought were the top
   three most important development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute
   most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth in Zimbabwe, and how “shared
   prosperity? would be best achieved in Zimbabwe.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Zimbabwe, WBG staff
   preparedness to help Zimbabwe solve its development challenges, their agreement with
   various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest
   values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in
   Zimbabwe, with which stakeholder groups the WBG should collaborate more, in which
   sectoral areas the WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge
   services), and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Zimbabwe, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Zimbabwe’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   WBG’s level of effectiveness across twenty-nine development areas, such as economic
   growth, private sector development, education, health, agriculture and rural development.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, the WBG imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Zimbabwe: Respondents were asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Zimbabwe, which services the
   WBG should offer more of in the country, and which development areas would benefit most
   from WBG playing a leading role as compared to other donors.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites and social
   media channels. Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, and their exposure to
   the WBG in Zimbabwe.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, a small number of respondents from multilateral agencies were
        combined with respondents from bilateral agencies; respondents from the financial
        sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
        respondents from NGOs1, community based organizations, faith-based groups, and trade
        unions were combined into the “CSO? category; and the few respondents from the office
        of the President, Deputy President, consultants/contractors working on World Bank
        Group-supported projects/programs, local governments, independent government
        institutions, and the judiciary branch were included in the “Other? category.

 Note that the sample included a large number of respondents from NGOs. However, statistical tests (comparisons
of weighted and unweighted data) showed no differences, therefore, the unweighted data are presented in the report.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Zimbabwe,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-nine
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Zimbabwe. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at regional conflict and tensions;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection; and
             The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Zimbabwe, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:

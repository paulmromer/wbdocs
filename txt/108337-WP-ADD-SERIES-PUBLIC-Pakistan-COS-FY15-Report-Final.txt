I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Pakistan perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues facing Pakistan
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Sectoral Effectiveness and Results
    The IFC and World Bank
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy and Sectoral Work
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Pakistan
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information


II. Methodology
From April to June 2015, 1,240 stakeholders of the WBG in Pakistan were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a Country Opinion Survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a Minister,
office of a Parliamentarian, employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implantation
agencies, Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project or
consultants working on WBG-supported projects, local governments, bilateral/multilateral
agencies, private sector organizations, private foundations, the financial sector/private banks,
NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs), the media, independent government institutions,
trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups, academia/research institutes/think tanks, and the
judiciary branch. A total of 262 stakeholders participated in the survey (21% response rate).
Respondents received the questionnaire via courier and returned them accordingly. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Pakistan, their overall attitudes toward the WBG, the
WBG’s effectiveness and results, the IFC and World Bank, the WBG’s knowledge work and
activities, working with the WBG, the WBG’s Country Partnership Strategy and sectoral work,
the WBG’s future role in Pakistan; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results of this year’s Country Survey were compared to the Country Survey conducted in FY
’12 (response rate was 51%, N=512). The data were weighted to reach similar stakeholder
compositions across the two survey years, allowing for more statistically reliable comparisons.
Stakeholder groups which were insufficiently represented in either fiscal year were not included
in these comparisons, nor were respondents who identified themselves as “other? in the
stakeholder category options. As a result, mean ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total
number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those of the original data reported
in the FY ’12 COS report and the non-weighted data presented in this report. For the weighted
stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix F (page 225).

III. Demographics of the Sample

Current Position
      Note: For all further analyses, the small number of respondents from the financial sector/
       private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations and the small
       number of respondents from trade unions, faith-based groups, and youth groups were
       combined with those from NGOs/CBOs to create a “Civil Society? category. The few
       respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister, the office of a Minister, and
       the office of a Parliamentarian were included in the “Other? category.

Geographic Location

     Note: Because of the small number of respondents from areas outside of Punjab, these
      respondents were combined into an “Other Areas? category for all further analyses. Only
      significant geographic location differences in ratings of indicator questions will be
      discussed in the body of this report. All geographic location comparisons can be found in
      Appendix C (see page 143).

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Collaboration with the WBG
        Note: For all further analyses, respondents who indicated that they had previously
         collaborated with the WBG were combined with those who had never collaborated to
         make one group of those not collaborating with the WBG, and those who indicated both
         (that they currently collaborate and had collaborated in the past) were combined with
         those who currently collaborate to create one group of those currently collaborating.
        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey were significantly more
         likely to be currently collaborating with the WBG (weighted percentage of respondents
         collaborating = 36.1%) compared to respondents from the FY ’12 Country Survey
         (weighted percentage of respondents collaborating = 25.5%)1.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Pakistan, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-three specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank
       Group’s overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific
       areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Pakistan.
       The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public financial management.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Pakistan, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at water, sanitation, and hygiene;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at nutrition;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health and population; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice.

Comparing responses across Country Surveys reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also changes in respondent
samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter factor, only those
questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. Although the FY12 and FY15 samples were fairly
similar, the samples from both years were weighted to have equivalent stakeholder groups.

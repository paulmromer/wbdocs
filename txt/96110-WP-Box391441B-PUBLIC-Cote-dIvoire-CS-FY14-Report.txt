II. Methodology
From December 2013 to January 2014, 500 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Côte
d’Ivoire were invited to provide their opinions on the World Bank Group’s assistance to the
country by participating in a country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the
office of the President; the office of the Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a
parliamentarian; ministries, ministerial departments, or implementation agencies;
consultants/contractors working on World Bank Group-supported projects/programs; project
management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials;
bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs; community based organizations; the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; youth organizations; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 288
stakeholders participated in the survey (58% response rate).
Respondents either completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency or they
received the questionnaire via email or courier and returned it accordingly. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Côte d’Ivoire; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank
Group (WBG); the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Côte d’Ivoire; and the WBG’s communication
and information sharing in Côte d’Ivoire.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Côte d’Ivoire: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Côte
   d’Ivoire is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty
   and generating economic growth in Côte d’Ivoire, and how “shared prosperity? would be
   best achieved in Côte d’Ivoire.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG, the WBG’s effectiveness in Côte d’Ivoire, WBG staff
   preparedness to help Côte d’Ivoire solve its development challenges, their agreement with
   various statements regarding the WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the WBG’s greatest
   values and weaknesses, the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Côte
   d’Ivoire, with which stakeholder groups the WBG should collaborate more, in which sectoral
   areas the WBG should focus most of its resources (financial and knowledge services), and to
   what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts. Respondents were also
   asked to respond to a few questions about capacity building and whether they believe the
   World Bank Group should have more or less local presence.
C. World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Côte d’Ivoire, the extent to
   which the WBG meets Côte d’Ivoire’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, the importance for the WBG to be involved in thirty five development areas, and
   the WBG’s level of effectiveness across these areas, such as security/stabilization/
   reconstruction/reconciliation, public sector governance/reform, poverty reduction, and job
   creation/employment.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they consult WBG’s knowledge work and activities and to rate the
   effectiveness and quality of the WBG’s knowledge work and activities, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate WBG’s technical
   assistance/advisory work’s contribution to solving development challenges and their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as the WBG’s
   “Safeguard Policy? requirements being reasonable, and disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Côte d’Ivoire: Respondents were asked to
   indicate what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Côte d’Ivoire, and which
   services the Bank should offer more of in the country. They were also asked to which areas
   the country will benefit most from WBG playing a leading role as compared to other donors.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s websites.
   Respondents were also asked about their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information
   policy, past information requests from the WBG, and their level of agreement that they use
   more data from the WBG as a result of the WBG’s Open Data policy.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, their exposure to the
   WBG in Côte d’Ivoire, which WBG agencies they work with, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 356 respondents (79% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2010. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

        to have the highest ratings for the importance of the WBG to be involved in these sectors,
        whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies often tended to have
        significantly lower ratings.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (page 83).
       There were significant differences between geographic locations in fourteen of the thirty
        five development areas. All ratings across geographic locations can be found in Appendix

Effectiveness of Sectoral Areas (continued)
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings for the effectiveness
        of the World Bank Group in almost all of these thirty five development areas, except
        “regulatory framework (6.4),? “gender equity (6.4),? “local governance and institutions
        (6.8),? “water and sanitation (7.2),? “energy (7.0),? and “health (7.3).?
       For a majority of the sectoral areas, respondents from the office of parliamentarian tended
        to have the highest ratings for the effectiveness of the WBG in these sectors, whereas
        respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies often tended to have significantly lower
        ratings.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (page 83).
       There were significant differences between geographic locations in nine of the thirty five
        development areas. All ratings across geographic locations can be found in Appendix C
        (page 105)

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Côte d’Ivoire,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-five
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Côte d’Ivoire. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster management;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at energy;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at transport; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Côte d’Ivoire, suggesting that
        ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
        ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
        these analyses were:
                The WBG’s effectiveness at energy;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at crime and violence;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The WBG’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions; and
                The WBG’s effectiveness at natural resource management.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates
The World Bank Group’s Work in Côte d’Ivoire
       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement
        regarding all of these statements compared to respondents in the FY ’10.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement with
        that “overall the WBG currently plays a relevant role in development in Côte d’Ivoire,?
        and that “the WBG supports programs and strategies that are realistic for Côte d’Ivoire.?
        For the most part, respondents from the media tended to have the highest levels of
        agreement, whereas respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to
        have significantly lower levels of agreement.
       Respondents across stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of agreement with
        the indicator statement that “the WBG’s work is aligned with what I consider the
        development priorities for Côte d’Ivoire.?
       There were significant differences between geographic locations in their levels of
        agreement with all three statements. Respondents from the Central had the highest levels
        of agreement, whereas respondents from the West had significantly lower levels of
        agreement.

Overall Perceptions
       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower levels of agreement
        that “WBG disburses funds promptly? compared to respondents from the FY ’10.
       In addition, respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of
        agreement that “the WBG increases Côte d’Ivoire’s institutional capacity,? and that “the
        WBG treats clients and stakeholders in Côte d’Ivoire with respect? compared to
        respondents from the FY ’10 country survey.
       There were significant stakeholder differences in their levels of agreement with all
        statements except “the WBG’s ‘Safeguard Policy’ requirements are reasonable.? For the
        most part, respondents from the media had the highest levels of agreement with these
        statements, whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies had significantly
        lower levels of agreement. This trend was reversed when the respondents rated their
        levels of agreement with the statement that “the WBG disburses funds promptly.?
       There were significant differences between geographic locations in their levels of
        agreement with three statements: “the WBG effectively monitors and evaluates the
        projects and programs it supports,? “the WBG’s approval and reviews are done in a
        timely fashion,? and “the WBG provides effective implementation support.? For the most
        part, respondents from the Central had significantly higher levels of agreement than
        respondents from the West.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates (continued)
The World Bank Group as an Effective Development Partner

        following qualities of the WBG as an effective development partner:
        “straightforwardness and honesty? and “flexibility in terms of changing country
        circumstances? compared to respondents from the FY ’10 country survey.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across many of these
        qualities (all indicator questions). For the most part, respondents from the media tended
        to give the highest ratings, whereas respondents from bilateral/ multilateral agencies
        tended to give significantly lower ratings (see Appendix B for details).
       There were significant differences between geographic locations in their ratings for four
        qualities: “openness,? “staff accessibility,? “ease of access to the people at the WBG
        who are making decisions important to my work,? and “being a long-term partner.? For
        the first three qualities, respondents from the East had the highest ratings, whereas
        respondents from the Central gave significantly lower ratings. This trend was reversed,
        when respondents provided ratings for the WBG being a long-term partner.

IX. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Côte d’Ivoire
Making the World Bank Group of Greater Value
       In the FY ’10 country survey*, respondents indicated that the Bank should reduce the
        complexity of obtaining World Bank financing (36%) to make itself of greater value in
        Côte d’Ivoire.
       While respondents from CSOs and bilateral/multilateral agencies were mostly likely to
        indicate that the WBG should reach out more to groups outside of the Government,
        respondents from the office of parliamentarian and academia/research institutes/think
        tanks tended to indicate that the WBG should provide more adequate
        data/knowledge/statistics/figures on Côte d’Ivoire’s economy.

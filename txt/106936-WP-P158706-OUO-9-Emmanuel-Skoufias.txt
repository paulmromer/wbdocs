1. Introduction
Brazilian labor markets have performed very strongly for most of the last 15 years, with dramatic
increases in the employment rate of unskilled workers and significant declines in the overall
unemployment rate. However, the economic and political developments and fiscal crisis of the last
sixteen months in Brazil have resulted in a substantial decline in the rate of economic activity , a
dramatic slowdown in the rate of new job creation a devaluation of the domestic currency and
increasing concerns about the sustainability of the gains in poverty reduction and inequality
accomplished during the years of the commodity boom…The decline in economic activity has raised
concerns again about increasing unemployment rates, and the extent to which these developments will
have an adverse impact on specific age and gender groups. Efforts to maintain or increase the
proportion of the population employed in the aggregate or within any specific demographic group must
take into consideration how the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate of the group
vary with changes in the level of economic activity. The sensitivity of the proportion of the population
employed to changes in the level of aggregate demand is a key parameter informing the design of an
appropriate and effective labor market policy.
Much of the recent labor market literature in Brazil has focused on the labor demand and labor supply
effect of structural changes in economy on the labor market during the two decades of the 1990’s and
2000’s. During these two decades, Brazil experienced dramatic structural changes such as the price
stabilization program in the early 1990’s, a liberalization in trade and financial markets as well as the
“macroeconomic tripod? in the late 1990’s, a policy framework consisting of an inflation target regime,
floating exchange rate and targets of fiscal discipline. Recent studies have focused on the negative or
declining trend in the national unemployment rate during the 2000’s in comparison to the increasing
trend in the unemployment rate observed during the 1990’s 2 Brunelli (2014), for example, carries out
an analysis of two decades (1992-2012) of structural shifts of labor supply and labor demand by using
the PNAD survey of IBGE, to examine the extent to which there have been structural changes in the
Brazilian labor markets over the long run as opposed to conventional business cycle fluctuations. He
finds that despite the importance of structural factors for both the labor supply and labor demand, that
the business cycle changes explain the bulk of the aggregate unemployment rate developments,
especially in the metropolitan regions.
Yet, aside from the literature on these long-run structural changes in the labor market in Brazil over the
last two decades, there is very little evidence available on how the Brazilian labor market might have
evolved in more recent years (e.g. within the last decade) as opposed to between the 1990’s and the
2000’s. In most cases analyses and policies are based on casual empiricism and inferences drawn from
the evidence available for the US labor market. Clark and Summers (1981), for example, demonstrate
that in the US, teenagers and young women are particularly sensitive to short-run movements in
aggregate economic activity. Specifically, teenagers and young women between 20-34 years of age
comprise only 25 percent of the adult population, but they account for more than 50 percent of the
cyclical variation in employment. In contrast, adult men between 26 and 64 years of age, who comprise
32.6 per cent of the population in the US account for only 23.6 percent of the change in the cyclical
variation in employment. 3Estimates of the sensitivity of the proportion of the population employed to
changes in the level of aggregate demand based on data from recent years that reflect the prevailing

  A recent paper by Gomme et al (2004) builds on the heterogeneity of cyclical employment across demographic groups
documented by Clark and Summers (1981) to extend the predictive power of the standard business cycle model.

structural relationships between labor demand and employment and labor supply, labor force
participation and unemployment are more useful for predicting how labor force participation is likely to
react to the downturn in economic activity since the end of the commodity boom and the onset of the
economic crisis in Brazil.
The purpose of this paper is to examine two inter-related questions about the behavior of the labor
market in Brazil. The first question is about the direction and sensitivity of the labor force participation
rate, and the employment rate to changes in the level of aggregate demand. The second question
relates to the differences in the cyclical sensitivity of these key variables across age and gender groups.
The next section of the paper discusses the recent macroeconomic context, and some of the limitations
associated with using PNAD data to predict changes in the on the labor force participation rate of
different age gender and skill groups during the crisis. Section 3 discusses the data and the model used


2. Labor Force Participation Trends, Vulnerability, and The Economic Downtrun
Between 2001 and 2014, there has been a considerable decline in the labor force participation rate
among most age groups and for both males and females (see Figure 1).

The end of the commodity boom has led to a steady reduction in the number of formal jobs created in
the Brazilian economy since the second half of 2010 (see Figure 2). These changes, in turn, have exposed
the underlying weaknesses and constraints in the consumption-driven growth model of Brazil. Brazil is
one of the countries with the weakest performance in productivity, accompanied by major deficiencies
in infrastructure, a distorted trade and investment climate, a lack of incentives and capacity for
innovation and insufficient individual skills. The change in external conditions has also revealed the
fragility of the progress made so far, with a growing middle class still vulnerable to falling back into
poverty, if growth of output and employment continue to stagnate as in the last three years. Yet the
rising aspirations of Brazil’s “new middle class? imply that policies that fail to address expectations of
further social progress are unlikely to be politically sustainable.

Even though poverty rates have significantly decreased in Brazil over the hast decade, vulnerability
remains high, particularly among less skilled workers. In 2013, for example, 13% of unskilled workers
(with less than primary education completed) lived below the poverty line of R$ 140 reais/month.
Nonetheless, another 20% lived between the R$140 and the vulnerability line of R$291, suggesting they
are in danger of falling back into poverty in the cases of a prolonged crisis (see Figure 3). The same is
true for workers with completed primary education (low-skilled workers): even though only 7% of them
are poor, another 14% live in the vulnerability zone.


                                                              3

Notes:
Workers are classified into three skill levels: the Unskilled, who did not complete primary schooling (including those with no
formal schooling at all); the Low Skilled, who completed primary school but did not complete secondary; and the Skilled,
who have at least a secondary-school education
Extreme Poor: if income per capita/month is less than the extreme poverty line of R$70 per capita /month
Moderate Poor: if income per capita/month is less than the moderate poverty line: R$140 per capita /month
Vulnerable: if income per capita/month is less than the Vulnerability Poverty Line: R$291 per capita /month


With labor income as the major source of income of the moderate poor and vulnerable households
there is a serious threat to the sustainability of the gains in poverty and inequality reduction (see figure
4). In spite of the downturn, persistent inflation nudging double digits continues to erode the real wages
of the employed (real wages down 4.3% year on year). At the same time continued reductions in formal
employment are already being reflected in a rising unemployment rate which has increased to 10.9 per
cent in March 2016, from 4.9 percent in February 2015. These trends are likely to result in increased
informal employment, and exits and/or entries into the labor force depending on the extent to which
affected households have access to adequate formal and informal safety nets.
Significantly positive “added worker effects? have been documented for the urban areas of Brazil,
whereby wives enter the labor force in response to their husband’s unemployment (Fernandes, and de
Felıcio, 2005). However, this study covered the years before the establishment of the formal safety net
system in Brazil as reflected by the Bolsa Familia program and its new version of Brasil sim Miseria. The
extent to which added worker effects dominate over discouraged worker effects and the way these two
opposing effects interact in the new context of coverage by social assistance programs is unknown.

Extreme Poor: if income per capita/month is less than the extreme poverty line of R$70 per capita /month
Moderate Poor: if income per capita/month is less than the moderate poverty line: R$140 per capita /month
Vulnerable: if income per capita/month is less than the Vulnerability Poverty Line: R$291 per capita /month
NOTE: In the 2016 PNAD it is not possible to distinguish between income from social programs and capital gains. So the share of
28.2% of total per capita household income from capital gains/social programs is actually exclusively composed of income from
social programs rather than capital gains.


The largest reductions in LFPR took place among unskilled men and women (see Figure 5). For example,
between 2004 and 2014, LFP declined among unskilled females and males irrespective of age. The only
groups with an increase in labor force participation were older (55 yrs old and above) low skilled and
skilled males and females with at least completed primary education.
One possible explanation for the decline in unskilled labor force participation is that with the onset of
the decline in new job creation in late 2010, the unskilled (those with less than primary), were
sufficiently discouraged so as to exit the labor force. A complementary explanation may be disincentive
effects associated with the increasing coverage of the cash transfers of the Bolsa Familia program
between 2004 and 2014. However, the variety of studies carried out so far have been unable to
attribute a major disincentive effect associated with these cash transfers.

Source: PNAD 2004 and 2014. This figure reports the percentage point (p.p.) change in labor force participation rates in
Brazil by gender, age group, and skill level between 2014 and 2004.
Workers in each age category are classified into three skill levels:
--Unskilled: Those who did not complete primary schooling (including those with no formal schooling at all);
--Low Skilled: those who completed primary school but did not complete secondary; and
--Skilled: those who have at least a secondary-school education


A Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition of the determinants of the change in labor force participation between
2004 and 2014 reveals that the majority of the change in labor force participation change can be
attributed to changes in the coefficients of the determinants of labor force participation rather than to
changes in demographic characteristics of the population. Thus, the data suggest structural changes in
the labor market even within the 2004 to 2014 period, which serves to reinforce the argument that
elasticity estimates based on data from more recent years are more useful for predicting how labor
force participation is likely to react to the downturn in economic activity.
One more factor that enters in to play is the extent to which the simple elasticity estimates of how the
labor force participation varies with growth in GDP based on annual changes in recent years is
believable. For example, as table 1 below highlights, simple elasticity estimates based on changes in
labor force participation from 2014 and 2013 PNAD suggest a positive relation between labor force
participation and changes in real GDP. If these elasticity estimates (based on the back of the envelope
calculations) were to be used then the decline in real GDP with the onset of the crisis would suggest a
decline in labor force participation during the crisis.

3. Data and Empirical Analysis
The data used are extracted from the Monthly Employment Survey (Pequisa Mensal de Empleo or PME),
which is the main monthly cross –sectional survey regarding employment in the formal and informal
labor markets in Brazil. The survey covers only six metropolitan regions (Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre,
Rio de Janeiro, Recife, São Paulo and Salvador) and it collects information on time use for individuals
aged 12 and over, education, family structure, and dwelling characteristics, as well as a standard set of
detailed questions on employment, unemployment and exit from the labor market.
The analysis in this note focuses on the labor force participation and employment of individuals 16 yrs of
age or older on the surveys from 2010:7 to 2016:1 or a total of 67 monthly observations). These years
are, by assumption, more representative the structural relations prevailing in the labor market in Brazil
these days, as opposed to the structural relationship underlying the elasticity estimates from the 2013
and 2014 PNAD surveys as well as the earlier years of the PME survey.4
The official measure GDP measure by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) is
constructed at a quarterly frequency using primary information from the national accounts. The monthly
GDP measure, used in this paper, is estimated by the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) for the purpose of
calculating the ratio between monthly economic aggregates such as public debt, current accounts or
credit and the GDP itself. In the first stage, BCB estimates the quantum values based on information
about the industrial production, energy consumption and primary goods exports and then adjusts it
according to the previous official quarterly GDP and real GDP estimates. The real value is calculated
using a weighted average of IGP-DI and IPCA.
The labor force status (employment, unemployment and being out of the labor force) of an individual is
defined according to the standard definitions. Specifically, an individual is employed (E) if he/she was

  As the annex of this note demonstrates, ignoring the structural change in the determinants of labor force participation by
pooling all the monthly observations for the period 2003 to 2016 results in elasticity estimates that imply a positive relationship
between cyclical variation in real GDP and labor force participation rates. The positive relationship also if one were to carry out
the analysis separately for the sample of years dominated by the commodity boom in Brazil 2003:1 to 2010:6
                                                                     7
working last week or if he/she held a job but was temporarily not working last week (e.g. being on
vacation, sick or waiting to start work within the week). An individual is unemployed if he/she searched
for a job during the last four weeks and if he/she was on lay-off last week, or if he/she was waiting to
report to a new job within thirty days or more. If an individual is not in the labor force (i.e. neither
employed nor unemployed) then he/she is classified as being out of the labor force (N).
Figure 6 below presents the labor force participation rate on a monthly basis as calculated from the PME
survey and the monthly real GDP estimated by the Banco Central do Brazil. Clearly, the trend in the real
GDP is positive whereas the trend in the labor force participation rate is negative.

The main focus of this study is to examine separately for each age and gender group the sensitivity of
each one of the two terms in the right hand side of equation (2) to the level of aggregate economic
activity. The sensitivity of the employment to population ratio to changes in aggregate demand is likely
to differ significantly across demographic groups.
Identity (2) reveals that the net effect of cyclical fluctuations in aggregate demand on the employment
to population ratio is determined by how the cyclical sensitivity of the employment rate and labor force
participation rate varies across different groups. As long as certain age and gender groups of workers
are more likely to enter the labor force or to be laid-off due to employers’ rules in laying off, or have a
higher tendency to quit over the business cycle, then there are likely to be differences in the extent to
which the employment to population ration varies of the business cycle.
In order to examine the cyclical sensitivity of employment and labor force participation, the analysis
follows Clark and Summers (1981) and estimates separate regressions using as explanatory variables,
the current and various lags of real gross Domestic Product (RGDP) (in log), a trend (T) and trend
squared, and twelve binary variables identifying each month in a calendar year ( ). Thus, the
equations estimated for each age and gender group indexed by the superscript g, are

and
                                                                                       
          (  ) = 0 + 1  + 2  2 + ∑11                             12
                                                  =0  − + ∑=1   +                 (4)
                 

Equations (3) and (4) are intended as a reduced from approximation for the cyclical determinants of
labor force participation and employment rates. A more structural approach would include additional
explanatory variables such as the inflation rate and the wage rate corresponding to the demographic
group g. However, such variables may also be co-determined cyclically with labor force and employment
thus raising problems about endogeneity and identification. The inclusion of the trend and trend–
squared terms allows for the long-run (secular) trend in growth in the economy whereas the twelve
indicator variables for each month of the calendar year are included in order to control for seasonality.
To ensure that empirically meaningful relationships are modeled and the problem of spurious
regressions is avoided it is necessary to test for the presence of cointegration between real GDP and the
labor force participation rate (and between real GDP and the employment rate). The presence of a
common stochastic trend (or cointegration) among two variables of interest is the main criterion for
stationarity in the relationship among two possibly nonstationary variables. For this purpose, two
alternative tests of cointegration between the two variables of interest in equations (3) and (4) were
carried out: (i) the Engle-Granger Augmented Dickey Fuller test for cointegration (Engle and Granger,
1987) and (ii) the Johansen test for cointegration (Johansen, 1988, 1991, 1995).6 The null hypothesis in
both tests is that there is no cointegration between the variables of interest while the alternative
hypothesis is that the variables are cointegrated. Rejection of the null hypothesis of no cointegration in
favor of the alternative implies that the regression equations (3) and (4) with RGDP and the labor force
participation rate or the employment rate in levels would be sufficient for the validity of standard
inference methods. In contrast, the inability to reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration would

imply that the relationship between these two possibly nonstationary variables would need to be
carried out in first-difference instead of level form.
The cointegration tests were carried out using the full data set of monthly observations for the period
2003:1-2016:1, so as to have the maximum number of time series observations. Table 2a in Appendix B
shows that for the majority of the gender age groups the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected
which implies that implies that the regression equations (3) and (4) with RGDP and the labor force
participation rate or the employment rate in levels are be sufficient for the validity of standard inference
methods.7
After controlling for the long-run trend, the real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP) serves as a measure of
the cyclical conditions in the labor market.8 The specification of equations (3) and (4) allows RGDP to
affect the current period labor force participation and employment rate with a lag. Recognition lags in
the realization that the aggregate economic activity has changed and lags in responding to these
changes due to frictions and other types of transactions costs may be reasonable explanations of why
the RGDP of previous months may affect current participation and employment rates. The lag length is
specified to be up to 11 months long. Therefore, the total effect of RGDP on the labor force participation
of group g is given by the sum of the coefficients of the current period RGDP and all its lags, i.e.
                                                                   11

whereas the total effect of RGDP on the employment rate of group g is given by
                                                                   11

  In Table 2a the cells where the hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected, is denoted by green background font. In fact, the
hypothesis is rejected in all female age groups for both the participation rate and the employment rate. That is not the case for
all age groups of males.

  In the US, the unemployment rate, is widely considered to be the more sensitive indicator of cyclical aggregate demand
relative to real GDP (Clark and Summers, 1981; Bils, 1985; Keane, Moffitt and Runkle, 1988; Abraham and Haltiwanger, 1995;
Dellas and Sakellaris, 2003).

    The coefficients reported for the employment to population ratio are obtained by estimating a version of equation (3) with

The estimates reveal substantial heterogeneity across age groups within gender as well as across gender
within any given age group. Cyclical increases in aggregate economic activity (proxied by cyclical
increases in the RGDP appear to be associated with dramatic changes in the gender composition of the
labor force and employment.
Higher aggregate demand (higher RGDP) is associated with a decline in the labor force participation of
both males and females except individuals of older age. Thus declines in RGDP during the crisis are likely
to lead to an increase in the labor force participation rate of females in all age categories less than 65.
On the other hand, higher aggregate demand (higher RGDP) is associated with an increase in the
proportion of males and females employed in most age categories except 65 yr old males and females.
In general the sensitivity of the employment rate to RGDP declines with age for both males and females.
The relatively higher bars in Figure 2 for females than males suggest that the employment rate of
females is more sensitive to RGDP than for males. Of course, this also implies that with declines in RGDP
the unemployment rate of females will increase more than that of males and the overall unemployment
rate likely to increase further because of the increased entry of women of all ages in the labor market.

An examination of the elasticity estimates for males reveals a different picture. The labor force
participation of adult males does not appear to be very sensitive to cyclical fluctuations. For example,
for 25-34 and 35-44 year old males, the estimated labor force participation elasticity is not statistically
different from zero. In contrast the labor force participation of teenagers (16-19 years old) appears to be
highly sensitive to cyclical changes in aggregate demand.
Equations (4) and (5) were also estimated separately for age and gender groups of 16 to 24 year olds
distinguishing between those attending school and those not attending school. An individual is defined
as attending school if he/she is reported to have devoted more than 10 hours studying during the last
week. (see Figure 8)

The estimates in figure 8 reveal that the labor force participation rate of teenage men and women who
are not attending school is negatively correlated with increases in real GDP. However, there are some
striking differences between those not enrolled and those enrolled in school. The sensitivity of the labor
force participation rate of males and females enrolled in school to changes in real GDP is considerably
higher than that of male and female teenagers not enrolled in school. On the other hand, the sensitivity
of the employment rate or (1-Unemployment rate) is much smaller compared to those not enrolled in

school. This pattern is identical to that observed for the US by Clark and Summers (1981). For young
men and women enrolled in school the sensitivity of the employment rate to RGDP is mall and the
sensitivity of the labor force participation is high. As a consequence, for this group, the sensitivity of the
employment to population rate to RGDP is determined almost exclusively by the sensitivity of the labor
force participation. The opposite pattern characterizes youth who are not enrolled in school. For this
group, the sensitivity of the employment to population rate to RGDP is determined almost exclusively by
the sensitivity of the employment rate to RGDP. One possible explanation for this pattern, that youth
enrolled in school, tend to passively await for job offers. When an acceptable offer arrives, they accept
and join the labor force. Otherwise they remain out of the labor force.
The higher positive relation between the employment rate and RGDP for teenagers not enrolled in
school suggests that declines in RGPD will decrease their employment more (and thus increase their
unemployment rate more) relative to those who are already attending school.
Equations (4) and (5) were also estimated separately for gender groups age groups 25 years old and
above by classifying individuals as unskilled, low skilled, and skilled workers. An individual is classified as
skilled if he/she has 11 or more years of education, low skilled if he/she has 8-10 years of education and
as unskilled if he/she has 7 or less years of education (see Figure 9).

Figure 9 also reveals a substantial heterogeneity in the cyclical sensitivity of skilled and unskilled
workers. Increases in RGDP appear to be associated with a decline in the labor force participation rate of
unskilled and low skilled workers but especially females. However, the employment rate of both males
and females increases with real GDP. Thus that the decline in RGDP associated with the crisis, will
decrease the employment rate of all males and females independently of the level of skill, while
increase the labor force participation rate of unskilled and low skilled females is likely to fuel increases in
the overall unemployment rate.
Finally Figure 10 also reveals differences in the cyclical sensitivity of Afrodescendants and white females
and males by age group. It is easily apparent that females and especially female of Afro-descendant
origin will enter the labor force as RGDP declines.

Demographic contribution to cyclical variation of employment, participation, and unemployment
Having provided evidence on the extent to which the cyclical sensitivity of employment and
unemployment varies across age and gender groups in the population, it is also useful to get estimates
of the relative importance of the various age groups in accounting for cyclical movements in aggregate,
participation.
Table 2 contains such estimates based on the elasticity estimates of labor force participation in to RGDP
and the population shares of the different age and gender groups based on the 2010 Census. Column (1)
simply reproduces the LFPR elasticity estimates reported in table 1 in Appendix A. Column (2) presents
the total number and column (3) the share in the total population of that age and gender group (based
on the 2010 Census) while column (4) presents the product of the estimated elasticity with the
population share. The numbers in column (5) present the ratio of the population weighted elasticity of
each demographic group to the sum of the population weighted elasticity across all demographic
groups.

Elasticity estimates (see table 1 in Appendix A) using data from the Monthly Employment Surveys (PME) of
Brazil for the period 2010:7-2016:1
The estimates in Table 2, reveal that the total elasticity of the labor force participation rate is -0.34
which implies that a 1-percent decline (increase) in the RGDP leads to a 0.34 percent increase (decline)
in the labor force participation rate. Table 2 also reveals a substantial change in the gender composition
of the labor force during the business cycle. Even though adult females (25-64 yrs old) are 35.2% of the

                                                          16
population, they account for 47.2% of the increase in labor force participation during the crisis (or a
period of decline in RGDP). Adult females are followed closely by teenagers 16-19 years old who account
for only 9.5% of the population but 44.1% of the increase in the labor force during the crisis (see column
5 of Table 2). Thus, in combination, changes in the participation of adult females and teenagers account
for 91.3% of the change in the total labor force participation during a crisis.
Calculating population weighted elasticity estimates for the employment rate (E/L) and the employment
to population ratio (E/N) sheds more light on the behavior of urban labor markets in Brazil (see Table 3).

Notes: Number of people based on 2010 Census
Elasticity estimates (see table 1 in Appendix A) using data from the Monthly Employment Surveys (PME) of
Brazil for the period 2010:7-2016:1


The population weighted elasticity estimates of the employment to population ratio for different
groups, presented in column (4) of Table 3, yield two major insights. First, adult men (25-64) and older
males and females account for 87% (=(0.102+0.055)/0.180) of the cyclical variation in the employment
to population ratio while adult women and teenagers account for a trivial (very small) part of the cyclical
variation. Although teenagers and adult females account for 91.3% of the change in labor force

                                                          17
participation, this change in the labor force participation is accompanied by a commensurate change in
the unemployment rate which ends having very little or no effect on the employment to population
ratio. For example, the population weighted elasticity of the labor force participation 0f adult women is-
0.160 whereas the population weighted elasticity of the employment rate is 0.166. As a consequence,
the population weighted employment to population elasticity being the sum of these two elasticities is
only 0.006. The same applies to teenagers. Thus, for these two groups the increases in the labor force
participation during an economic downturn is practically equivalent to an increase in the unemployment
rate. Second, the total population weighted elasticity of the employment to population ratio implies that
a 1-percent increase (decline) in the RGDP leads to a 0.180 percent increase (decline) in the employment
to population rate. This implies that discouraged worker effects, as opposed to added worker effects,
are dominant in the urban areas of Brazil during times of crises.
Discouraged workers effects are also dominant in the US labor market, where for the economy as an
aggregate, a 1-percent increase in the prime-age-male unemployment rate (used as a measure of
changes in aggregate economy activity) leads to a 1.5-percent decline in the employment to population
ratio (Clark and Summers, 1981). The decline in economic activity (accompanied by a higher
unemployment rate) tends to discourage potential workers about their prospects of employment
preventing them from entering the labor market and searching for a job.
In contrast, in urban Mexico and urban Colombia, the increased employment to population ratio during
periods of decline in economic activity suggests that significant “added worker? effects are in operation.
The added worker effect states that secondary workers such as women and teenagers who are not
strongly attached to the labor force join the labor market when economic conditions deteriorate, and
pull out of the labor market when conditions improve (Skoufias et al, 2007).
Table 3 is also helpful at getting a better understanding of the sources of the employment changes. The
total population weighted elasticity estimate of the employment to population ratio is by definition
equal to the sum of the total population weighted elasticity of the labor force participation (i.e., -0.339)
and the employment rate (or one minus the unemployment rate) (i.e., 0.519). These elasticity estimates
imply that a 1 percent decline in RGDP is accompanied by a 0.339% increase in the labor force
participation rate and a 0.519 decline in the employment rate. Thus the observed decline in the
employment to population ratio during the business cycle is driven by the exit of workers from the labor
force (or the proportion entering the labor force is less than the proportion exiting).


4. Concluding Remarks and Policy Considerations
To summarize, the analysis in this paper implies that cyclical fluctuations in aggregate economic activity
in Brazil, as in the US, Mexico and Colombia, are accompanied by dramatic changes in the composition
of the labor force. When aggregate demand falls (and aggregate unemployment increases) adult
females, and teenagers. The net effect of this inflow of “new? workers in the economy does not increase
the overall proportion of the population that is employed in spite of the decline in aggregate economic
activity. Instead it results in a higher unemployment rate for these demographic groups. Overall
however, the estimate of the total population weighted elasticity of the employment to population ratio
implies that a 1-percent increase (decline) in the RGDP leads to a 0.180 percent increase (decline) in the
employment to population rate. This implies that discouraged worker effects as opposed to added
worker effects are dominant in the urban areas of Brazil during times of crises.
These characteristics of labor market behavior in Brazil have at least two important implications for
policy. First, efforts to decrease unemployment and/or increase employment among a specific
demographic group need to take into consideration the way in which the labor force participation of this
                                                         18
group responds to cyclical variations. Teenagers and adult females account for 91.3% of the change in
labor force participation during a crisis and for these two groups the increases in the labor force
participation during an economic downturn is practically equivalent to an increase in the unemployment
rate. Second, the prevalence of discouraged worker effects is likely to have serious consequences on the
information content of the official unemployment measures. During good times the influx of
discouraged workers may increase and contribute to keeping unemployment rates high (while they are
looking for job and until they eventually get a job) while during economic downturns, they may
contribute to unemployment rates being artificially low. These workers, because they have not looked
for work in the previous four weeks, are not considered unemployed, even if they want to go back to
work. As a result, the monthly unemployment figures don't necessarily offer a complete picture.

In this appendix, Table B.1 reports elasticity estimates using the full period of data available
(2003:1-2016:1) ignoring the possibility of a structural change in the coefficients of equation (3)
and (4). Table B.2 is analogous to Table 2 in the body of the paper, but based on the elasticity
estimates from Tabel B1.1. It is important to bear in mind that ignoring the structural change,
the estimates suggest that the population weighted elasticity of labor force participation to
RGDP is positive (0.224) meaning that a 1 percent decline in RGDP leads to 0.224 decline in the
labor force participation rate. It should also be noted that repeating the regression analysis
using the subsample of observations prior to onset of the crisis (2003:1-2010:6) also yields a
positive population weighted elasticity of labor force participation to RGDP (0.104).

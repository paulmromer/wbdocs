Introduction
The objective of this report is to explain the relatively good performance of Burundi in the PASEC and
EGRA tests. Burundi had the highest scores of all participating countries in the PASEC evaluation, well
above other countries (one standard deviation, 100 points on a scale of 500). The EGRA results are
also relatively good with acceptable levels of reading fluency and reading comprehension, close to
Kenya and better than many other African countries1. The core question here is: What drives this
good performance? What are the reasons for Burundi’s relative success? What actions can be
envisaged to sustain and foster education quality in Burundi? What actions could be funded under a
World Bank project?

1. Description of the study and Burundi context
1.1 Methodology
We will first adopt a macroeconomic point of view to compare Burundi’s indicators and key policies
parameters with other countries. A certain number of international standards have been set and it is
against these desirable targets that we can compare Burundi’s position. A brief literature review of
the determinants of education quality will allow us to formulate a series of hypotheses to explain
Burundi’s performance. After using qualitative analysis, we will then mobilize microeconomics to
identify determinants of individual and school performance that will shed light on actions that can be
envisaged.
The analysis of administrative and legislative documents and teaching supports focused on the old
curriculum (pre 2012/3), syllabus and cycle IV textbooks (lower secondary), as well as legislative texts
related to the current reform. Most of the interviews with officials and education partners took place
as part of a World Bank mission to Burundi from 13 to 24 March 2017. We met with education
officials at ministerial, provincial, communal and school levels as well as the technical and financial
partners in Bujumbura. The exchanges focused on the implementation of fundamental school
reform: the challenges they face, school curricula and teacher training.

Unfortunately, we did not have the time to meet with the pupil's parents or attend a recently
established school management committee meeting, which would have allowed us to assess further
community participation. These new structures are not yet rigorously and systematically
implemented. Interviews with teachers and principals took place in the form of group focus sessions.
They focused on the teaching of reading and writing in cycle I and, in some cases, were followed by
classroom observations.

As for the classroom observations,2 they focused on the practices of the teacher and the activities of
students in grades 1 and 2. Unfortunately, these field visits were conducted in an unfavorable
period3. In general, visits to the classes of Bujumbura Mairie (Gikungu, KamengeIII and Mirango I),
the provinces of Bubanza (école fondamentale (ECOFO) of Giko and Kigondeka), Karuzi (ECOFO of
Kiyange I and II in DCE Shombo) and in Gitega (ECOFO of Tutegama) corroborated the observations
we carried out in the LASCOLAF (2009-2010) and EGRA (2011-2012) studies.

  They began with the last week of the first trimester courses held on March 15, 2017. The exams that took
place from March 17 to 31 were followed by the work of bulletins (3-5 April) before the proclamation of April 7
and The Easter holidays (from 8 to 23 April). It should be noted that even if the revision period has just been
reduced from 3 to 1 day, the impact of examinations on the time of school learning is still evident (see point
3.2).

1.2 Burundi context
Burundi is a low income country with a GDP per capita of277 (current USD) in 2015, one of the
lowest in the World (World Bank). The poverty rate is 65% (RESEN). The total population is around 11
million, with a high density. Burundi is a predominantly rural country. The youth (15-24) literacy rate
(2008-2012) is 89.6 for male and 88.1 female, one of the highest in SSA. There has been much
progress in terms of education indicators – with the development of pre-schooling, for instance. The
primary completion rate rose from 54% in 2009 to 71% in 2014 (comparable to the African average).
The gross intake rate into lower secondary (“collège?) rose from 33% to 63% between 2010 and
2014. In the last years, Burundi spent around 6% of its GDP on education, with the support of donors
who funded 35.8% of education spending in 2015, though the political crisis of 2015 provoked the
withdraw of bilateral donors. The World Bank seeks to compensate this loss by reinvesting in the
education sector.
Burundi has several unique features. First, 95% of the population speak one language (Kirundi)
which is the medium of instruction in the lower grades of primary (until grade 4). Second, like the
DRC, around half of the schools are semi-private schools (“écoles conventionnées?), built and
managed -- to a certain extent -- by religious communities. Last, substitute teachers are common4, a
situation not often found in Africa.
1.3 Education reforms
Burundi has undertaken several reforms in the framework of its development plan (PSDEF 2012-
2020). The core reform is the introduction of the “Ecole Fondamentale? to include 9 years of
compulsory schooling. This entailed the shortening of lower secondary from 4 to 3 years, with these
classrooms now being built in the compounds of the primary schools to allow for the establishment
of basic education of 9 years on one campus.
The national syllabus has been revised starting with lower secondary materials (cycle 4, years 7,8,9),
after the same curricula (per objective) had been used since 1989 at the primary level. As a result,
Burundi, unlike many other countries that have conducted several pedagogical reforms, has enjoyed
relative stability in terms of teaching materials and methods. The consistency of the curriculum
(from teacher pre-service training to school textbooks) over time, regardless of the quality and
relevance of its content, might be a reason for Burundi’s good performance. Indeed, in several
countries, Benin is a good example, a competency-based approach has been promoted but with
implementation problems and a disconnect between teacher practices and official instructions (CIEP5
2009). These reforms might have created a form of confusion in the classrooms that negatively
impacted learning outcomes. Hence a first suggestion is to properly implement the new syllabus by
matching teacher training with textbooks and acknowledging the difficulty of changing teacher
practices in the classroom.
1.4 Learning outcomes
Several sources of data concur regarding the relatively good performance of Burundi: the two PASEC
surveys (2009 and 2014), the two EGRA datasets (2011 and 2012) and literacy surveys. The 2014
PASEC data shows clearly the position of Burundi: high performance both in reading and math in
grade 2 (test in Kirundi), more than 100 points above average (500 points).

It is generally admitted in international surveys that half a standard deviation is equivalent to one
year of schooling. That means that Burundi is two years ahead of other Francophone African
countries. However, when considering international standards and levels of achievement in the
industrialized countries, Burundi still lags behind. A comparison of the SACMEQ and PIRLS results
(with common items) shows that southern African countries have a 4 year schooling gap in terms of
learning outcomes when compared to the USA and Europe. Assuming PASEC and SACMEQ countries
have the same achievement levels, Burundi is still 2 years behind northern countries.6
The distribution of oral fluency is described below:



6
  In this comparison, Burundi has not yet met the international standards of educational achievement. As an example, still
37% of the pupils cannot count after 80 at the end of grade 2. Average reading fluency is around 26 words per minute in
grade 2 (the same as Rwanda), below industrialized countries (where the median is 89 words per minute at the end of
grade 2 in the USA (Hasbrouck (2006)). 26 words per minute, the average for grade 2 pupils in Burundi, falls in the 10th
percentile in the USA. (http://www.readingrockets.org/article/fluency-norms-chart.) The assumption here is that if Kirundi
is more transparent then English, results in Kirundi should be even higher than in English. Of course, the comparison is
untenable in many other ways: the context in which Kirundi is used and learned and how literate an agrarian society like
Burundi’s is, compared to the context in the USA, is understood to be entirely different.

A maximum of 20.4% of non-readers in grade 2 (cannot read a word aloud) is observed in Burundi
versus 33% on average for the countries participating in the EGRA barometer7 and an average of
53.8% in African countries. Burundi has the lowest proportion of non-readers among African
countries.

In Grade 6, the situation evolves when pupils were tested in French. The PASEC performance of
Burundi in reading is close to the average and now no longer outstanding.

There might be a positive effect of learning in a mother tongue8 in the early grades. It may be that it
creates a solid foundation that transfers into upper grades where the teaching is done in French, a
foreign language only spoken at home by 3.2% of the grade 6 pupils (PASEC). In the 2009 evaluation,
PASEC used both French and Kirundi9 languages to test pupils at grade 210 and 5 in language
(including reading, grammar and written expression). The table below shows quite clearly that in
grade 2 the results in Kirundi are much better than the test in French.

 This has been widely debated in the literature.

   At this time, French became the language of instruction in grade 5, and is taught as a subject since grade 1.

When French is used for international comparisons in grade 2, Burundi has one of the lowest
performance11 as shown by the graph below– even though it still has high performance in math.




Source: PASEC (2010)

In 2014, the fact that the Kirundi language is used to test pupils in grade 2 partially explains why
Burundi is performing so well. In 2014, at grade 6, 40% of the pupils reached the highest level in
math (level 3, problem solving) versus 7.4% in reading (level 4, complex inference). Assuming the
highest PASEC levels match curricula objectives, Burundi pupils are still far from universally reaching
national targets, especially in reading. Finally, girls outperformed boys in grade 6, an unfamiliar
situation in Francophone africa. The gender parity index in enrolment is 0.99.
Finally, we present data on end of secondary examinations while acknowledging the difficutly to
consider them reliable measures of schooling quality. Despite an increase of 7 percentage points
between 2010 and 2013, the pass rate for the 10th year exam in 2013 remains extremely low. Indeed
less than one student in four was declared admitted in 2013 to this examination while the rate was
only 14% in 2010. The success rate of the State examination (or end-of-course examination of the
humanities. the equivalent of a baccalauréat) was cyclical during the period: in 2013 it was at 27%,
practically the same as the 2010 level, a slight constrast to its 2012 value where 31% of students
were declared admitted.

 The data in the graph differs from the data in the table since only a subset of items is used for international
comparisons.

2. Macroeconomics and policy analysis
2.1 Comparative situation of Burundi
In the early 2000’s, Mingat & al (2003) compiled a list of indicators and targets for reaching universal
primary enrolment (UPE), referred to as the Fast Track indicative framework. The analysis, which
relies on the trajectories followed by countries who reached UPE, provides a set of relevant factors
for performance. Globally, countries that reached UPE devoted sufficient resources to education
(with a focus on primary education and non-personnel expenses), had teachers with reasonable
salaries, low repetition rates and the participation of the private sector in education provision. Pupils
were equipped with school materials and had enough instruction time. We believe this framework,
still used by organizations such as the Pole de Dakar and the Global Partnership for Education, is a
good reference. We completed the list of indicators for Burundi with data from PASEC on learning
conditions and outcomes in alignment with the literature on efficient schooling and minimum
conditions to be met in schools (Abadzi (2006)). The data is found in annex 7.
First, what we see very clearly, as noted earlier, is that Burundi has very little linguistic diversity,
particularly in comparison to, say, Cameroon where 280 languages are spoken. In all PASEC countries
except Mali and Burkina Faso, the medium of instruction is the French language right from grade 1, a
language not spoken at home. We believe this could be the main reason explaining Burundi’s
performance in the early grades.
Second, Burundi spends up to 35% of the state budget on education (excluding debt), a remarkable
effort when compared to other countries (20% on average). An adequate level of education
expenses might indeed help explain good performance, although statistical analyses over the world
show little correlation between education budget and results (Altinok 2010). That said, the share of
investment budget is low (1.9% of the education budget). In 2014 19% of the budget (35.9% in 2015)
was funded by donors, in addition to contribution from donors allowing Burundi to benefit from
technical expertise, rigorous budgeting mechanisms and monitoring and evaluation procedures.
Substantial education aid is probably another reason for Burundi’s success.
The share of private schooling is low or almost inexistent (1%). The repetition rate remains high
above 20%, despite reductions in recent years. There is a high proportion of female teachers and
school heads. Most teachers received 2 years of pre-service training but very little in-service training.
What is paradoxical is that class size remains high on average with uneven distribution and over-
crowded classrooms in some schools when compared to other PASEC countries. 46% of the pupils
operate in double shift, a school organization detrimental to learning time. There is a lack of
textbooks in the classrooms and only 5% of the schools have a library. The official annual teaching
time is 855, 59 hours less than the SSA average (914). Only 22% of teaching time is devoted to
Kirundi in grade 2.
Other PASEC data show that Burundi ranks on average in terms of school infrastructure and
classroom equipment. Few schools have running water or electricity.
Rwanda shares similar patterns with Burundi but with a lower repetition rate. A comparison of
EGRA results between the two countries, while noting that Kinyarwanda and Kirundi are very similar
languages, shows that reading comprehension can be improved in grade 3 in Burundi. EGRA analyses
and classroom observations show teachers tend to spend too much time teaching decoding to the
detriment of comprehension. Teachers give little homework, where analyses show this could
improve test scores -- especially when pupils get help at home (Varly & Mazunya 2012).
The allocation of resources (trained teachers, materials) in early grades compared to other grades
is good in Burundi compared to other countries that tend to concentrate resources on upper grades.
For example, 72.7% of grade 2 teachers have had two years of training compared to 68.2% in grade


                                                   9
6. It is well known that learning in the early grades is crucial. This is a potential explanation for
Burundi’s good performance.
When looking both at education inputs and results, Burundi remains an outlier. The country has its
own particularities, such as high repetition rates, persistence of double shift classrooms,
overcrowded classrooms, lack of textbooks, low private provision, low official instruction time, all of
which are not conducive to learning according to the literature. With the exception of literacy rates
(a cause and a consequence of good education quality) and the high proportion of female teachers,
which are indicators associated with higher results12, contextual and policy factors do not explain
Burundi’s performance.
Burundi does not fit the typical model that one usually associates with education performance.
2.2 Matching standards
Once again, if the learning outcomes and conditions are relatively good, Burundi is far from reaching
absolute good standards. The color codes used in the table (in the annex) reveal areas where Burundi
is far from standard -- both in absolute terms when available or when considering other country
indicators.
From a cost-efficiency perspective, some actions should definitely be envisaged, like deworming
and other health interventions, such as the provision of reading glasses. These interventions have
proven to be quite effective. Given the problem of undernourishment in many Burundi families
(RESEN), school feeding programs could also be an option to sustain attendance and learning.
From a budgetary point of view, Burundi should continue mobilizing domestic resources. Financial
indicators are remarkably well aligned with the standards, with the exception of the proportion of
non-salary expenses (20.5%) that could reach 33% with the help of World Bank. Private schooling
could be supported. Repetition rates (mainly due to lack of classrooms in lower secondary) should be
given attention. The construction of classrooms both in primary and lower secondary would certainly
have a positive impact on repetition rates, class size and the reduction of double shift, areas where
Burundi reveals the greatest gap with usual standards.

3. Qualitative analysis

3.1 Research questions
Since traditional input indicators used to describe performance are of little use in the case of
Burundi, one should dive a little deeper into a qualitative analysis. Further hypotheses can be
formulated to explain Burundi’s performance, in terms of:
     1.    Teaching time
     2.    Curricula standards
     3.    Curricula content
     4.    Teachers practices in the classroom
     5.    Nature of the Kirundi language
     6.    Support received at home by pupils
     7.    Community contribution
     8.    Remedial instruction
     9.    Testing
     10.   School autonomy & management
     11.   Accountability.
These factors, which are all found in the literature, can only be quantified with difficulty.
3.2 Teaching time
Concerning teaching time, since no dedicated study was performed, we rely on the PASEC data.
Attendance seems average compared to other countries while official instruction time is low and
double shift classrooms frequent. Moreover, student lose about a month at the end of each
trimester preparing for and taking tests. As a result, we cannot conclude that Burundian pupils have
higher contact time then their African counterparts. This could be investigated in more detail13.
In order to reach the UNESCO-requested standard of 1050 hours per year, the curriculum states that:
"In Burundi, and in most countries we evaluate too much and badly". It is in this perspective that the
new Cycle IV manuals have been developed and that, in addition to the increase in the transition rate
towards the 7th year, the recent abolition of the national exam organized at the end of the 6th
primary year has been transferred to the end of the 9th year, which should theoretically augment
learning time. Indeed, the main concern of pupils, parents and teachers has so far focused on the
success of this exam, which is considered elitist, if not Malthusian.

3.3. Curricula standards

The Burundian education system has experienced three main postcolonial innovations: (a) the 1973
reform which dealt with the kirundisation-ruralisation of schools, (b) the reform of the school
curricula in 1989, and (c) the reform of the so-called fundamental school which started in the 2013-
2014 school year. These three reforms pursued the same intercultural approach to early language /
mother tongue learning. In addition to this, it should also be pointed out that primary textbooks have
always been developed locally and not imported. Let us recall here the preponderant role played by
the Catholic and Protestant churches which invested in literacy and evangelization in Kirundi. Initially,
it was from catechism schools that schools developed. The written tradition of Kirundi, compared to
other African languages, should be considered a plausible hypothesis for the high literacy rate in
Burundi.

Compared to the previous 1989 programs, the new curriculum reflects on the new challenges
documented in the PSDEF. The old programs did not take into account the high rates of repetition, or

13
 Pole de Dakar has plans to do so.

                                                    11
drop-out, as out-of-school youth easily reintegrated into a rural lifestyle. Another aspect to be
considered is that Burundi, which is one of the poorest and most indebted countries, is in a post-
conflict period marked by the AIDS pandemic, a galloping demographic generating land conflicts and
degradation of the economy, environment, not to mention its digital gap. Thus, "education for
responsible and sustainable citizenship" is also at the heart of the revision of the basic school
curriculum and textbooks.

For points 2 and 3 above, curricula standards and curricula content, we submitted a summary of the
syllabus and extracts of textbooks to an international expert in reading, Helen Abadzi. Her review
indicates that in terms of educational standards and given the fact the medium of instruction is the
mother tongue, Burundi could have a more ambitious curriculum in matters of reading in the early
grades. The conditions of moving to another grade are slightly more restrictive than other countries14
and could explain the high repetition rates. In sum, the education standards of Burundi are not very
distant from the other countries. However, in reading, curricula expectations are going to be
increased. The designers of the BEPEF who are developing the textbooks for the 1st cycle propose a
reinforced program of reading-writing. All the vowels and the single, double or triple consonants thus
far studied over the 2 years of the cycle will be studied in the 1st year.


3.4 Curricula content
According to Abadzi, the textbooks, while relatively simple in their presentation and sequencing, rely
on a mixed approach (whole word and syllabic) which is not the most efficient method in the
context of developing countries, especially given the insights of neurosciences on the matter (Abadzi
2006). The sequencing of the lessons could be revised. These textbooks are under revision. It is fair to
conclude that Burundi’s performance cannot be explained by its official curriculum. But it could be
explained by better teaching practices.
The curricula and teaching materials are designed by the Office of Pedagogy and Teaching for Basic
Education (BPEEF (ex-BER)) for primary and imported or designed by the Office for Pedagogy for
Post-Basic/Secondary Education (BEPES) for former colleges (current Cycle IV of the Fundamental).
Currently the curriculum and textbooks are designed on-site, with the support of partners. The
former primary school curriculum (BER, 1990) was based on three axes for Kirundi: "Tuvuge"
(parlons), "Dusome" (lisons) and "Twandike" (written). The new curriculum is more explicit because
it specifies the skills to be acquired in cycles. Please refer to Annex for curricula content.

3.5 Teachers training, support and supervision
3.5.1 Initial teachers training
The graph below show that Burundi primary teachers are relatively well trained compared to other
countries, but with an uneven distribution across regions (especially in the western region). Teachers
enter initial training after lower secondary (upper secondary in many PASEC countries and other
African countries).

Initial training of primary school teachers is organized in teacher training colleges, which will
gradually replace the Teacher Training Schools. It will be multi-purpose because the future teacher
will learn how to teach all the disciplines of cycles 1, 2 and 3 in two years (D6 qualification), while
teachers of the 7th, 8th and 9th grade classes (Cycle IV) have so far been trained at the Ecole
Normale Supérieure and the University of Burundi in four years for D7 qualifications. The programs of
these three structures were harmonized three years ago, within the framework of the BMD reform in
higher education (Bachelor in 3 years, Master in another 2 years and Doctorate in another 3 years).

In principle, initial teacher training programs should be revised to conform to the new directions of
the reform which requires a new profile for teachers. This is because there will be the introduction of
new disciplines, such as Kiswahili, English and Entrepreneurship, on the one hand, and, on the other,
teachers of cycle IV will teach several disciplines grouped together in the same field: in languages, for
example, the same teacher may teach Kirundi and French, or Kiswahili and English. For the moment,
teachers seem to be insufficiently prepared to teach English and Kiswahili without the proper
content knowledge (Varly & Mazunya 2012).

3.5.2 In service training

The new curriculum makes teacher training a sine qua non for the success of the reform. Interviews
with teachers have shown that the main innovations conveyed by the curriculum are often unknown
or misunderstood by teachers. These include: a) Focus on student learning, b) grouping disciplines in
fields, c) a new exit profile of the basic education laureate, d) reorganizing the time and the system
of (F) the introduction of cross-cutting themes in the various fields. It will be necessary to accelerate
their initial and continuing training in this direction.

The Ministry of Education carried out accelerated training courses for teachers in cycle 4, in summer
2014 for teachers in the 8th, in 2015 for teachers in the 9th and in April 2017 for the entire cycle 4.
The objectives were to help teachers to assimilate the content of the curriculum of basic education,
the structure and content of new textbooks and teacher guides, and the new pedagogical
approaches advocated.

These in-service training courses, organized over five days for each group of teachers, were not
sufficient, given the expectations of teachers of mastering new educational approaches and thematic
and methodological innovations. In addition, the in-service training of teachers in cycles 1, 2 and 3
has not yet begun, as it can only be organized after the finalization of the relevant textbooks. It is

                                                   13
regrettable that this on-going development of textbooks has not been based on an evaluation of the
old curricula and textbooks still in use, which would have highlighted good practices to be
maintained.

In short, technical and financial support is strongly recommended to accompany the updating of the
initial teacher training programs so that objectives and contents are in line with the aims of the
reform. The same recommendation is valid for the organization of in-service training courses which
are traditionally carried out in the form of out of school training sessions and are expensive. They can
be accelerated and systematized by peers within the framework of the newly established school
systems. Furthermore, given that the use of new communication and education technologies will
become widespread, especially after all partners have greatly appreciated their experimentation in
Burundi within the framework of the IFADEM.

3.6. Teachers practices in the classroom

EGRA classroom observations (snapshots) showed a high homogeneity of teacher practices across
classrooms. The typical reading lesson is the following: teacher gives model reading, pupils read
silently and some pupils read aloud. This is also found when analyzing teaching methods in other
African countries (Bold 2017). However, Burundian teachers tend to speak more with one pupil while
group work is rare. It could be an option in overcrowded classrooms. Only 10% of the observations
recorded the teacher explaining or asking a question, a proportion close to other countries. The
behavior of teachers does not vary between the 2nd and 3rd grades whereas one would expect that
in the last grade there would be more time on reading comprehension than on reading aloud,
according to the official program and teacher guidebook (Varly & Mazunya, 2012).

From a qualitative point of view, the same was noted during classroom observations in March 2017.
On this occasion, classroom observations and textbooks led us to hypothesize that the performance
of Burundian schoolchildren was due to the participative approach used in teaching of reading and
writing in the 1st and 2nd years. The lesson of the day appears on both wallboards on the walls and
on the blackboard with letters in color. The student textbooks also contain illustrations and capital
phrases followed by their decoding, first in syllables and then in letters. With these teaching aids,
various activities are organized: the reading of single words, phrases or text (containing double, triple
or quadruple consonants); phraseology (that is, constructing sentences from new words), students
sing these letters, go ahead to designate the upper and lower case letters on their books distributed
by the teacher, write on the board or draw the animal or the object containing the letter studied,
repeat collectively and individually, etc; the explanation of difficult words or expressions, the locating
of words containing double, triple or quadruple words consonants, dictation, understanding of the
text. In short, more in depth classrooms observations point at relative good practices : reading and
writing are done at the same time, both playfully and actively.

For its part, the teaching of mathematics is based on a student's experience and aims to solve
problems encountered in everyday life. The teacher leads the student to build his own knowledge in
interactions with his fellow students. This learning of mathematics through activities starts from the
concrete and leads to the abstract. The problem often mentioned by teachers is the absence of
teaching aids such as objects to be manipulated to illustrate the addition, subtraction, division or
multiplication operations.

3.7. Languages of instruction
In primary, Kirundi is used as medium of instruction until grade 4 and French takes over at grade 5
though it is taught as a subject from grade 1. Kirundi and French have linguistic resemblances and



                                                   14
differences that need to be taken into account in didactics. So, the linguistic transition that is to take
place in grade 5, must be well prepared.
3.7.1. Comparison of the Kirundi and French languages

As mentioned by the teachers themselves, the difficulty of teaching Kirundi is the double and triple
consonant (ex.: nti, ntwa), something which deserves more time being allocated to it in teaching
(Varly & Mazunya, 2012). In addition, Kirundi, which is part of the greater Bantu language family, is a
tonal language that is made complex by its double and triple consonants.

However, teaching / learning of Kirundi does not present specific difficulties as a mother tongue. On
this question, psycholinguistic approaches show that cognitive and language development is the
same in all mother tongues, at least at the level of the spoken language. The problem does not
therefore arise in terms of intrinsic difficulties but in terms of access to writing, especially in African
countries without a written tradition. Kirundi needs to be strengthened at the level of the official
codification of its spelling on the one hand and on the other hand at the level of its lexicon which
needs to be enriched and modernized in order to meet the new technological requirements of
globalization. New policy in Burundi (2014) makes many recommendations in this direction.

By comparing Kirundi with French, we find that these two languages have the pedagogical advantage
of sharing the same Latin alphabet, which is not the case for children who have Arabic as their
mother tongue or script that does not include Latin letters, as in Mali, and who must make their first
contact with reading-writing in French as a foreign language. However, the writing of Kirundi is
phonological, whereas that of French which is historical is at the basis of the many difficulties related
to the learning of its spelling. At the morpho-syntactic level, Kirundi is a synthetic language whereas
French is rather analytical. Textbooks do not sufficiently emphasize those aspects of contrasting
linguistics that allow teachers to identify the origin of their pupils' faults and then adopt appropriate
pedagogy for the treatment of linguistic and cultural interference.

3.7.2. Linguistic transition
The curriculum recognizes that, since 2007, "learning 3 foreign languages (English, French, Kiswahili)
in the first year represents an important cognitive overload for most students. Orally, they must
become familiar with systems organized differently (syntactically, lexically and phonologically).
Moreover, the simultaneous confrontation of students with four grapho-phonological codes makes
learning more difficult and time consuming. The mastery of the language of schooling and the first
entry into writing are essential for the quality of learning and the success of schooling."

With this in mind, some of the curriculum recommendations need to be implemented, which could
significantly increase the time devoted to core subjects such as languages of instruction,
mathematics and science. In particular, it is necessary to shift the current simultaneous teaching of
the four languages from the first year onwards and to envisage a smoother linguistic transition of the
languages of instruction. French is used as medium of instruction in grade 5. Please refer to Annex 5
for details on the linguistic transition.

As for the linguistic transition model, several studies admit that the quality of learning is good when
students learn consistently in the mother tongue. This is the case of Burundi where the good
performances of pupils would be justified by the teaching in Kirundi until the 4th primary year.
Considering that "the transition from one language of instruction to another is a crucial and difficult
step in student learning," the curriculum proposes "a gradual linguistic transition to Cycle 3 as
outlined in Annex 5.


                                                    15
The Ministry of Education considered the generalization of bilingual education by piloting it in some
schools from 2012 to 2015, as part of the ELAN-Africa Francophone initiative (School and national
languages in Africa). The ELAN-Africa project organized training courses for teachers in the so-called
integrated or convergent didactics of Kirundi and French and, on the other hand, contributed to the
development of integrated teaching materials15. These tools have provided teachers with a
contrasting approach to the phonological, morpho-syntactic and lexical structures of Kirundi and
French, as well as to the linguistic and didactic complementarity of the teaching languages and
didactics of non-linguistic disciplines such as mathematics.

3.8. Support received home by pupils
45.7% of grade 3 teachers never give homework (28.3% in grade 2) though daily practice of reading is
known to improve results (Moore and others, 2017). Less than 15% of the pupils have books at
home. 41% of students report never reading at home in the 2nd year. 43.5 and 33.9% of pupils in
grade 2 and 3 respectively reported not receiving help at home. Most aid comes from brothers and
sisters, parents provide little support despite relatively high literacy rates. Opportunities to read at
home16 are clearly associated with higher results as shown below (Varly and Mazunya 2012).
Generally speaking, children have little opportunities to read home.




Source :Varly&Mazunya (2012)

81.8% of grade 6 pupils participate in farming activities, the highest proportion in PASEC countries.
This is not conducive to school related activities.
3.9. Community contribution
Burundian households contributed 38% of current expenditure on education in 2013. Burundian
families spend an average of 67% of their total education expenditure on various types of education
(enrollment, school fees and other fees), 15% for the purchase of school supplies, 13% for uniforms
(school and sports gear) and 6% for transportation (Pole de Dakar 2017).
In addition to these valuable financial contributions, there is talk of more involvement of parents in
the new school management committee (CGE), which, according to the law, is run by a member of

15
 These include bi-grammars and the bilingual lexicon Kirundi-French and French-Kirundi for pedagogical use.
The index of reading opportunities at home combines several indicators such as the availability of books at
home, frequency of reading and help received in homework. An evaluation of this pilot was carried out but it
was not rigorous.

the community democratically elected by the parents, with the school director just being the
secretary.
3.10.Remedial instruction
First, PASEC data and other sources of information have consistently pointed at the relative
inefficiency of repetition as a remedial strategy (Bernard & al 2005). Indeed, in Africa the test scores
of repeaters are often lower than the others. Burundi is a special case, where repeaters do not have
significantly different scores than others in the early grades (PASEC 2014). The repetition process
might be more effective in Burundi then in other countries. The selection criteria for promotion to
higher grades are also more restrictive in Burundi than in other countries17.
In reading, the remedial strategies used by teachers are: more individual reading time, requiring help
from parents, help from other pupils, homework and finally delivering remedial sessions. It seems
remedial strategies can be improved in Burundi and do not fit with best practices. Other solutions
can be tested, as shown in Annex 8, relying on teacher’s aide or peer support. Given that repeaters
do as well as non-repeaters, remedial practices are rather good in Burundi compared to PASEC
counterparts.
In Burundi, some wealthy parents are used to paying for evening classes for their children, especially
in urban areas. The results are seen in the ranking of schools in examinations and end-of-cycle tests.
The Ministry of Education has called for reinforcement courses paid and provided by classroom
teachers who tended to ignore pupils not enrolled in these courses. However, more detailed studies
should show the place given by teachers to remediation.
    3.11.Testing
An effective testing system in the classroom is a factor for the improvement of learning outcomes
but one with potential side effects (causing, for instance, teaching for the test). The national Ministry
of Education examination directorate is operational and experienced. It has participated in
international assessments, EGRA and national assessments (including value added of schools).
Training sessions on the EGRA tools were delivered in the region in 2012. The relative good
assessment system is also an explanation of Burundi performance.
The Burundian education system places emphasis on evaluation-grading, which, it says in the new
curriculum, "often drives learning and leads teachers to favor what will be" useful and effective "to
the detriment of social importance and / or personal learning. "Thus, about one-third of the time
spent in school is devoted to systematic evaluations which" are logically at the heart of pupil
repetition procedures and "justify" a classification of schools according to their results. The
implementation of the reform, centered on learning, should give the opportunity for a certain
evolution of practices and representations that exist socially. The ideal approach would be a system
where teachers would be able to say what the students have learned and if these skills and
knowledge are sufficient to follow in the upper class."

3.12.School autonomy& management
More school autonomy, under certain conditions, is an avenue to improve learning (Hanushek 2013).
The “écoles conventionnées? have some autonomy in terms of pedagogical practices and as a result
have higher scores than public schools. However, in the public sector, the system is heavily
centralized as in other Francophone African countries. Though there is a move to decentralization,
for the moment centralization is still prevalent and so this decentralization could really be described
as de-concentration.

The semi-private schools that are ‘sous-convention,’ are generally run by Catholic and Protestant
religious groups. They are better equipped and better directed than public schools with a lay director

who does not always have the same physical availability and the same spirit of dedication. From the
year 2016-2017, the Government has just created a dozen schools of excellence that are intended to
compete with the good reputation of these schools.

3.13.Accountability
Accountability at different levels of the education system is also a factor associated with better
learning outcomes. School supervision is pyramidal: the school supervisor supervises the
administrative and pedagogical course of the courses and reports to the municipal education
directorate. It reports to the provincial level, where it is routed to the central government, which
draws conclusions on the level of continuing education needs. In short, it can be said that the quality
of education stems from leadership at all levels.

    4. Micro economics analysis
The following section investigates individual and school level performance factors by analyzing
regression results on PASEC and EGRA data.
4.1 Sources of variances
First, multilevel analysis show that the variance comes mostly from the pupil level (73.3% at grade 2
and 81.5% at grade 6, the highest proportion among PASEC countries) rather than school level. In
reading, 93.3% of the variance between pupils and 56.1% of the school variance remains
unexplained. This means that a large amount of potential variation of the performance arise from the
pupil’s environment and communities. EGRA analyses yield similar findings.
PLS regression undertaken in the EGRA 2012 report shows that 20.3% and 14.2% of students’ reading
fluency variation is respectively explained by the student’s opportunity for reading at home and the
level of supervision he or she receives (Varly & Mazunya 2012, Richard 2011). These results show
that when students benefit from a relative’s support at home with homework and/or frequently
practice reading at home, this positively influences reading results . Additionally, having literate
parents increases a student’s opportunity to receive supervision at home. Most pupils (79.4%) have
at least one literate parents. Support from parents is an avenue for improving learning outcome.
School and principal characteristics also explain a significant variation (12.6%) of students’ results.
Insecurity severely impacts students’ schooling. On the other hand, “sous-convention?18 schools,
which often benefit from more experienced principals and are thus potentially better managed,
show a higher proportion of autonomous readers. Best students might also enroll in those schools
(self selection). On the contrary, teacher’s pedagogical practices and behaviors in the classroom
explain little variation of student achievement in reading. The reason for this could lie in the fact
that in Burundi most teachers use traditional teaching practices in reading and offer little remedial
intervention. Teachers spend most of time reading texts and listening to students’ reading it out
loud. The table I Annex 6 summarizes regression models on test scores.

4.2 Factors at student level

Both EGRA 2011 and 2012 assessments demonstrate that students’ characteristics and the
supervision they receive at home, have a positive impact on their reading ability. Children with
greater opportunities of reading at home, with the possibility to bring their textbook home, and who
receive support from their family, demonstrate better results. EGRA 2011 results also show that
students who speak Kirundi with their parents or have literate parents demonstrate greater success
in their reading results. Pre-school has no significant effect, unlike in other countries.

18
   In Burundi, like in France, these are schools that follow the national curriculum but are operated by non-
governmental entities, like the Catholic or Protestant church. They are similar in some ways to Charter Schools
in the US.

                                                      18
During the 2011-2012 school year, the Burundian Ministry of Education decided to proceed with a
nation-wide distribution of Kirundi textbooks in primary school early levels, which allowed 96.6% of
students to use a textbook during reading activities in 2012, against 58% in 2011. Despite the positive
impact of using a textbook in the classroom for students shown in EGRA 2011 assessment, the
greater availability of textbooks in Burundian classrooms in 2012 is not correlated with students’
reading results in the model, since the binary variable “Use of a textbook at home? shows practically
no more variation. Pupil’s textbook ratios dropped in 2014. This must be investigated.

While, in EGRA 2011, age has a positive impact on students’ results, once controlling for repetition, in
PASEC 2014, students’ age has a significant negative effect on both students’ results in mathematics
and reading. In the PASEC model, the age variable may capture part of the repetition impact, and this
hypothesis is supported by the 2011 EGRA model where the repetition variable at student level has a
negative impact on students’ reading results. However, in the EGRA model there is no clear
correlation at school-level between the proportion of non-readers and repetition rates.

Moreover, in PASEC, no significant difference has been found between children who completed
preschool education and those who did not. Similarly, a student’s socio-economical background does
not have an impact on results in the model which is a very atypical result. Burundi primary reading
and mathematics scores are above the average of those participating francophone SSA countries,
which supports the hypothesis of a high proportion of “positive atypical children?19 – that is, that the
education system in Burundi succeeds in reducing the socio-economical inequalities that may affect
students’ progress.

4.3 Factors at classroom-teacher level

In Burundi, teachers do not favor dynamic learning interactions with and between students in the
classroom, such as remediation by peers or comprehension activities, and largely resort to more
traditional teaching practices20. When observing EGRA 2012 regression results any conclusion about
the influence of teachers’ in-classroom pedagogical practices on students’ performance cannot be
easily made. However, as demonstrated by both EGRA assessments, when analyzing the isolated
effect of specific pedagogical practices, it does appear that the time devoted to individual support
by teachers and the use of peer support in the classroom improve students’ results . In addition, in
EGRA 2012, almost half of the Grade 3 surveyed teachers never give homework to their students,
while at this grade level students acquired greater reading competencies which can be easily
improved by daily practice of reading at home. However, in EGRA 2011, 77% of students who have
the opportunity to bring their textbook home are autonomous readers, against 71% for those who
do not have this possibility21. The opportunity of bringing their textbook home is not necessarily
associated with a higher frequency of actually reading at home. High illiteracy rates and poor support
from relatives with homework could explain these observations.

The two EGRA assessments and PASEC 2014 results show that teachers’ characteristics, such as
seniority, level of diploma or gender do not impact students’ results . In Burundi, teachers have a
homogenous level of initial training, with respectively 72.7% and 68.2% of Grade 2 and Grade 6
teachers having received a minimum of two years of pedagogical training.



19
   Positive atypical children are defined as children with low socio-economical background who belong to the
best performing students at the end of their primary schooling , often referred as “resilient? pupils.

                                                      19
However, when a teacher devotes more time to support a student individually, the three
assessments show greater students’ reading results, irrespective of the class size. Moreover, in EGRA
2012, the average performance of the classroom has a significant and positive impact on individual
performance.

That said, EGRA 2011 and PASEC 2014 results show differing results for class size: EGRA 2011
suggests that when exceeding 40 students and PASEC when exceeding 60 students per class,22 the
class size has a negative impact on students’ results. Finally, the PASEC 2014 model estimates that
the level of school equipment, infrastructure (teacher’s room, toilets, playground, running water and
electricity), and pedagogical resources positively impact students’ reading competencies.

4.4 Factors at school/principal level

The high rate of insecurity in and around the schools impact learning. With the 2015 political crisis,
violence has increased in the country, and several assaults have been reported in schools, which
severely alters the learning environment for Burundian children. In the 2011 EGRA model, “sous-
convention? schools appear to have greater results than public schools, which may be explained by
the better school management there, as corroborated by the positive correlation of students’
results with the frequency of meetings organized by the principal with teachers.

    5. Conclusion and recommendations
5.1 Conclusion on the reasons for Burundian success
From a macro-economic point of view, Burundi is an outlier both in terms of input and learning
outcomes. Burundi spent 35% of his budget on education and its education expenses structure is
well aligned with international standards. Burundi receives a substantial aid for education. As long as
resources are turned into results, education expenses are probably the first reason for Burundi’s
success. Literacy rates are high due to the interventions of the religious communities. The relative
written tradition of Kirundi, compared to other African languages, is to be considered as one of the
plausible hypotheses of the high literacy rate in Burundi that positively impact pupils learning.
However, class size and repetitions rates are high, double shift account for 46% of the classrooms
and official schooling time is low. The classroom and school equipment can be improved and levels
are close to other countries average. There is a lack of textbooks in the classroom, lack of books in
the schools and at home and pupils have little opportunities to practice homework. Violence is
frequent in and outside schools. The learning conditions are relatively poor in Burundi and not
conducive to achievement. Learning conditions do not explain Burundi good performance. However,
a focus on resources on the early grade is specific to Burundi and could explain why results are good
in grade 2.
Teaching conditions appear to be better than in other African countries and Burundi teachers have
more positive opinions than others in that regard (PASEC2014). Most teachers have had two years of
initial training and the curricula, until now at least, has not changed over time. Teachers have
enjoyed a certain consistency in terms of official instructions and in school textbooks that are being
revised and can be improved. While better curricula both in terms of content and standards cannot
be cited as a reason of success, teachers are better prepared to teach than in many countries. They
also benefit from pedagogical supervision and supplementary teachers.
Their pedagogical practices in the classroom are similar to other African countries and explain little
variation of the performance. However, in the early grades, teaching and learning is facilitated by the
fact that the medium of instruction, Kirundi, is the home language of teachers and pupils. This is

22
   The PASEC 2011 report (p.44). The RESEN 2016 states that there is no statistically significant effect of class
size of between 40 and 60 on student performance, though there is above 60 (RESEN 2016, p.77).

corroborated by PASEC scores that are much lower in French than in Kirundi. The relative simplicity
of the maternal language it is the core reason for Burundi’s relative success.
Burundi still does not reach international standards in many respects. The withdraw of the bilateral
donors and the political crisis and violence clearly jeopardize recent progress in the education sector
and stress the need for further multilateral financing. Another strong incentive to invest in Burundi’s
education sector are the unit costs which are much lower than in African countries, particularly in
testing or school construction (insert unit cost compared). To do so, interventions from the World
Bank should be aligned with the education plan, well localized, driven from evidence and tailored to
be efficient. Under these conditions, we can identify priority areas and recommendations to support
the implementation of the education plan and the reforms. These are the syllabus and at the level of
the “école fondamentale?.

5.2 Way forward-Recommendations
Area 1: Support to curricula reform
The revision of the syllabus should well planned, articulated logically and supported logistically and
financially CIEP (2009). In order to do this, the reform should start with revision of the official
instructions, setting feasible standards, teachers guide book, textbooks and other materials, teachers
training, monitoring and evaluation.
To support the revision of the syllabus, recommendations are to:
    1. Provide peer review (Rwanda among others) of the draft textbooks produced with the
         assistance of CIEP and UNICEF
    2. Associate teachers with the revision of the syllabus
    3. Revise initial training programs according to the new syllabus
    4. Deliver in-service training based on the newly developed materials
    5. Support teachers pedagogical supervision
    6. Equip teachers supervisors with classrooms observations instruments
    7. Pilot and monitor the implementation of the new curricula in the classrooms
    8. Organize an evaluation of the learning outcomes in lower secondary at the start of the
         project (baseline) and three years after (end line).
    9. Conduct an assessment of teachers’ academic and pedagogical knowledge in French
         language teaching.23
    10. Revise the repartition of the subjects in the timetable in the early grade, allowing more time
         for Kirundi.

Area 2: Improve learning conditions
The learning conditions are still far from standard. We recommend to:
    1. Build classrooms in primary and lower secondary to reduce class size and repetition rates;
    2. Provide all pupils with textbooks they can take home;
    3. Provide children with low-cost reading booklets to improve the possibility of reading at
        home;
    4. Build and equip school libraries or community reading centers accessible to students after
        school;
    5. Equip all schools with latrines and running water;
    6. Ensure all pupils receive deworming treatment and are equipped with reading glasses when
        necessary;
    7. Develop school feeding and health programs.

Area 3: Develop remedial support for students in and out of the classrooms
Pupils should have more opportunities to work in and outside schools.

23
     IFADEM has started working in this area.

                                                  21
1. Ensure pupils are given homework;
2. Organize awareness campaigns for parents in support of pupils’ homework;
3. Promote differentiated remediation for students who have reading difficulties;
4. Diversify the use of pedagogical practices/support in the classroom, in order to favor more
   dynamic interactions between students and teacher, through teachers training;
5. Encourage remedial practices such as peer remediation in the classroom.

Annex 1 : Data collection and methodologies
In Burundi, two EGRA data collections were conducted in 2011 and 2012 with support from the
World Bank, and the country participated in the 2009 and 2014 PASEC evaluations. While the 2011
EGRA test concerned only Grade 2 students, the 2012 test also included Grade 3 students and
allowed a comparison of Burundi’s results with EGRA conducted in Rwanda in the same year
(including a common subset of items). PASEC tested Grade 2 and Grade 6 students, but the statistical
model used only allows an analysis of students’ performance in relation to contextual factors at the
end of primary school cycle.
While EGRA uses the number of words read per minute and reading comprehension to measure
student reading performance, PASEC, besides using an average score on a 500 scale, defines four
levels of reading competencies, and a threshold that demarcates the minimum level of competencies
required for students to continue their schooling. The tests were adapted into Kirundi and
background questionnaires were administered to students, teachers and school principals in order to
capture contextual elements at student, classroom-teacher, and school-principal levels. EGRA
background questionnaires are derived from PASEC. Early grades students were tested in Kirundi
while grade 6 students were tested in French.
In 2012 EGRA and 2014 PASEC, some variables were pooled into indexes (ex. the opportunity to read
at home, innovative teaching support, etc.) in order to facilitate the understanding of the results. In
comparison with the 2011 EGRA, the 2012 assessment includes a set of new variables derived from
the observation of students’ and teachers’ in-classroom practices. It allows for in-depth analysis of
the impact of teachers’ pedagogical practices on students’ reading progress.
The EGRA assessments use a statistical method that includes an initial student score that captures
part of a student’s environment effect and the student’s innate capabilities. The 2011 EGRA model
uses the number of letters read per minute at student level, taught at grade 1, which best reflects
students’ competencies when entering Grade 2. More detailed information on data collection and
methodology is available at Annex 1.

Annex 4: Curricula expectations


Let us take the case of the first cycle (years 1 and 2) in Kirundi, in French and in calculation:

1. Kirundi
A) Linguistic tools, grammar, enrichment of the lexicon: No metalinguistic work, but an initiation to
the structure of the language by implicit structural exercises.
B) Reading / Writing: Alphabet (double, triple and quadruple consonants,). Classify words by the 1st
letter, decipher new words read / recite narrative text, poetic informative. Read a very short
familiar text (narrative, informative, poetic), Write a very short narrative text (lived experience,
imaginary) Copy a short text correctly.
C) Oral production / comprehension: decipher new words read / recite a narrative text, poetic
informative. Orally cut a sentence into words, syllables and phonemes. Recite a short patrimonial
text. Telling events of everyday life, a short story imagined.

2. French
A) Linguistic tools (vocabulary, grammar / conjugation): Produce and understand simple simple
expressions about people and things. Use oral expressions of politeness (thank, apologize, etc.).
B) Phonology: Distinguish and pronounce the basic phonemes of French. Cut out a word orally in
syllables.
C) Literacy: grapho-phonological skills for the linguistic repertoire already constituted. Spell, read
and write a single word.
D) Listening / Speaking: Ask a question and answer it. Sing a song, recite a rhyme. Produce a simple
sentence from an image.
E) Written Comprehension / Production: Connect a written word to an image. Write a word
corresponding to an image. Understand the context elements of a very short text.
In future language textbooks, all lessons will be organized on ten themes from the era to the 9th
fundamental.

3. Calculation
A) Number and Numeration: Read and write in numbers and letters the integers up to 99. Give
meaning to the counting and use of the digits and their position in the number.
B) Operations: Addition and subtraction. Resolve sharing and distribution problems.
C) Measurements and markings: compare lengths, masses, capacities, objects and then use an
unconventional unit then the usual units. Identify events in a timeline and characterize durations.
A) Geometry and Space: Locating and locating objects in the world around us using spatial
vocabulary. Classify plane figures according to properties (shape, color, side number, size). Names,
plots and classifies lines (curved, broken, straight, closed and open, vertical, horizontal) freehand or
with the aid of material. Use paper to make folds, cut geometric shapes and a pencil to make
drawings

Annex 8 : The Teacher Community Assistant Initiative (TCAI) in Ghana
Innovation for Poverty Action (IPA) assessed the impact of a primary school remediation programme set up by
the Ghana Education Services, the Ghana National Association of Teachers, and the Ghana Youth Employment
and Entrepreneurial Development Agency (GYEEDA), a public agency promoting youth employability.

The remediation programme consists in four interventions:

    1) Immediate remediation, simultaneous to the formal sequence of teaching, by community education
       assistants to the least performing pupils

    2) Deferred remediation, outside the formal sequence of teaching, by community assistants to the least
       performing pupils

    3) Community education assistants provide remediation to a randomly selected group of pupils per
       grade level that consists in a review of the formal education program in reading and mathematics

    4) Provide training to teachers on immediate remediation practice, consisting of organizing the class into
       groups of pupils, organized by level of competencies, and adapt teaching support and practices
       according to each group.

Community education assistants, as well as teachers, received a one-week training course on remediation
pedagogy, which included the presentation of remediation tools (e.g. diagnosis of pupils in difficulty, learning
environment arrangements), as well as training in teaching materials and educational content adapted to
remediation practices in reading and mathematics. The salaries of the community assistants were covered by
GYEEDA.

Of the four interventions, immediate remediation and deferred remediation by community education
assistants were those that significantly improved student performance in a sustainable manner. Indeed, one
year after the end of the program, the students targeted by these interventions performed better than their
peers. These two interventions also proved to be the most cost-effective.

From the TCAI, it appears that peer remediation also known as peer tutoring has a positive influence on pupils’
achievement. Peer tutoring is a pedagogical support system based on an identification mechanism and
anchored in a mutual learning process. The tutor is a priori not a teaching professional, and proximity of age,
social and cultural background, and education path between the tutor and the tutored pupils facilitate the
identification mechanism.
Peer tutoring initiatives generally consist of voluntary help from a high school or university student towards a
lower-level student or group of students who have demonstrated academic, motivational or behavioral
difficulties. Tutoring must be voluntary and can be remunerated or gratified with school credits. Tutors must
have good relational and social qualities, and great academic competencies. Peer tutoring can be used as a
remediation or a prevention practice.

Abstract
This paper introduces a novel corporate financial vulnerability index, which tracks financial
conditions of the non-financial corporate sector. Using balance-sheet information of 14,207 listed
non-financial firms in 69 emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), the index shows
that, at the global level, corporate vulnerability sharply increased since 2013 and has stabilized in
2016. Regional trends are more heterogeneous, pointing to significant corporate vulnerabilities in
East Europe and Central Asia, as well as a deterioration of firms‚Äô financial conditions in Lati n
America, Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. The energy sector
has exhibited the fastest deterioration, particularly since 2014, in part driven by the decline in oil
prices. However, if currently relatively benign global funding conditions and higher commodity
prices endure, companies may have an opportunity to strengthen their balance sheets. This paper
also finds that the index has leading indicator properties for socio-economic outcomes such as a
rise in unemployment and an economic recession, and outperforms a commonly used ‚Äúdebt at risk‚Äù
approach.

           1      Introduction

Corporate debt in many emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) has risen significantly
since the global financial crisis1 (IMF 2015) raising concerns about financial stability and spillover
risks to the real sector. This paper introduces the Corporate Vulnerability Index (CVI), a novel
country monitoring framework that tracks financial conditions of the non-financial corporate
sector in EMDEs. Using readily available balance-sheet information of listed non-financial firms,
the CVI is based on seven indicators2 which capture four key dimensions of firms‚Äô financial
vulnerabilities: debt service capacity, leverage, rollover risk, and economic performance.
In recent years, a growing literature has attempted to quantify corporate financial vulnerabilities
in EMDEs (Financial Stability Board, 2015; IMF, 2015, 2016a, 2017; IIF 2015 and 2017; World
Bank, 2016; Beltran et al, 2016). While most of these studies assess vulnerabilities in terms of the
interest coverage ratio (ICR) and leverage, some also consider corporate vulnerability along other
dimensions, such as maturity mismatches (e.g. Gonzalez-Miranda, 2012; Rodrigues Bastos et al,
2015; Alfaro et al, 2017), and find that firms have changed their leverage and maturity structure
between 2000 and 2013 to take advantage of benign global financial conditions. However, this
literature focuses on a relatively small sample of firms in a select number of countries.
Our paper is related and contributes to the literature in several respects. First, we propose a novel
vulnerability index which extends the widely-used concept of ‚ÄúDebt at Risk‚Äù (see for example
IMF, 2016a). Debt at risk is the total amount of debt in a country (or industry) associated with
firms which are deemed financially vulnerable, typically for firms with an ICR below a threshold.
Our contribution is to apply this concept across multiple financial vulnerability indicators since
firms can be financially vulnerable across multiple dimensions at the same time. The CVI appears
to have leading indicator qualities; an increase in the CVI tends to be associated with a future
economic recession and an increase in unemployment. Our findings also suggest the CVI is more

 The seven indicators are: Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR), Leverage ratio, Net debt to EBIT ratio, Current liabilities to Long-term liabilities ratio,
Quick ratio, Return on Assets (ROA), and Market to Book ratio.

informative for future socio-economic outcomes compared to the commonly used Debt at Risk
approach based on ICR (IMF, 2017; FSB, 2015).
The CVI is related to a large literature on corporate default modeling based on accounting data
(e.g. Altman, 1968) and distance-to-default or contingent claim models based on market prices
inspired by Merton (1974). Unlike the CVI, these models however require default and price data
which are not readily available for a wide range of countries and/or firms. Another important
advantage of our balance-sheet-based approach is that it can easily be extended to cover non-listed
firms.
We also add to the ‚Äúearly warning‚Äù literature which suggests corporate debt overhangs can be a
leading indicator of crises and growth slowdowns as well as having the effect of amplifying shocks
(for Europe: Goretti and Souto, 2013; Aiyar et al., 2015; Bergthaler et al. 2015; for emerging
markets: IMF, 2015; Lindner and Jung, 2014). Finally, unlike many previous studies that are based
on small samples or individual countries, our paper is based on a large sample of 14,207 listed
firms, spanning 11 years (2006 to 2016) and 69 EMDEs; this should make our findings more
representative.
At the global level, the CVI suggests that vulnerabilities have risen sharply since 2013 but have
stabilized in 2016. This global trend is caused by an increase in leverage and a deterioration of
both profitability and debt service capacity. However, regional trends are heterogeneous as
corporate vulnerabilities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) have been elevated since 2007,
while Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) show a rapid increase in vulnerability since 2013.
In 2016, most regions have stabilized except the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA), whose corporate sector‚Äôs vulnerabilities have risen. A key finding is that
energy-linked sectors have shown an increase in financial vulnerabilities, especially since 2014,
in conjunction with the decline in oil prices.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes recent trends in non-financial corporate
sector debt in EMDEs and discusses the methodology to construct the CVI. Section 3 describes
the data used for the construction of the index. Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5
describes robustness tests and extensions. Section 6 concludes.

             2     Methodology
  2.1 Trends in Non-Financial Corporate Debt in EMDEs
Non-financial corporate sector debt in many EMDEs has risen significantly since the global
financial crisis3 (Figure 1.1). Moreover, given unprecedented accommodative monetary policies
in the developed world, EMDE corporates have raised significant volumes of financing from
global capital markets, mostly denominated in foreign currencies and typically not fully (naturally)
hedged. This has had the effect of changing the composition of corporate debt in EMDEs away
from bank credit and towards debt securities, with bond issuance from EMDE corporates more
than doubling since 2010 (Figure 1.2).4
With the sharp decline in commodity prices since 2014 and the downward revisions to growth
prospects across EMDEs, both firms‚Äô profitability and debt service capacity have trended down in

those countries. Consequently, financial risks from the EMDE non-financial corporate sector have
emerged, which have been reflected by the widening of corporate Credit Default Swaps (CDS)
spreads across regions, the rise of non-performing loans in the EMDE banking sector, and the
significant declining of corporate bond issuance since 2015.

In the current global environment, questions have been raised about the financial stability risks of
the corporate sector in EMDEs and the potential spillover effects on their financial sectors as
corporations may face tightening in the global financial conditions and/or lower and more volatile
commodity prices.
  2.2 The Corporate Vulnerability Index
The CVI is a composite indicator that assesses non-financial corporate vulnerability in emerging
and developing economies (EMDEs). Based on corporates‚Äô balance-sheet information, the CVI
measures four key aspects5 of financial vulnerability that have been identified by the literature as
leading indicators of corporate financial distress: Debt Service Capacity, Leverage, Rollover Risk,
and Profitability/Market Value. As shown in Figure 2, these four aspects of corporate vulnerability
are measured using seven indicators for which data are readily and sufficiently available across a
broad range of EMDEs: Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR), Leverage Ratio, Net Debt to EBIT Ratio,
Current Liabilities to Long-term Liabilities Ratio, Quick Ratio, Return on Assets (ROA), and
Market to Book Ratio. This set represents a diverse mix of indicators which are based on both flow
and stock data; it makes our approach more robust compared to, for example, the common ‚ÄúICR-
only‚Äù approach which could simply flag a transient issue since the ICR is solely based on flow
data. Indeed, although some of our indicators are conceptually correlated through basic accounting
identities, empirically the pairwise correlations between the indicators are statistically significant
but relatively low across the four broad factors (Table 1) suggesting they capture different
corporate vulnerability aspects and collectively can produce a more reliable result.

 We recognize that other variables such as currency risks are important as well. However, as we explain in the Data section, data limitations prevent
us from including them in our framework.

                                                                         4

The CVI is based on the concept of ‚ÄúDebt at Risk‚Äù (DaR), the total amount of outstanding debt in
a country (or industry) associated with firms that are deemed financially vulnerable. DaR is an
attractive concept to track corporate vulnerabilities since it exposes both the risk and magnitude
present in the tail of the firm‚Äôs distribution, as opposed to other methodological approaches such
as calculating averages or medians of (normalized) firm vulnerability indicators. Specifically, we
define Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±å as the share of corporate debt in a country that is considered vulnerable according to
indicator Y at time t and country c: 6

  The CVI can be calculated at country-industry level. In that case, all calculations described in this section are conducted using information of
corporate debt at country-industry level. Given that thresholds are calculated by industry, they are not modified when the VI at country-industry
level is calculated.

Note: Our sample includes financial information from 14.273 listed non-financial firms in 96 Emerging and Developing Economies, for years 2006
to 2016. A representativeness restriction is imposed in which countries with at least 5 firms in the sample are considered in the calculations.
Therefore, the adjusted sample includes 14.207 firms from 69 countries.



We use 1 as a threshold for ICR since firms with profits less than interest expenses are immediately
highly vulnerable. This threshold is more conservative than in other studies, but we find that a
value of 1 provides consistent results. For Leverage Ratio, Net Debt to EBIT Ratio, and Current
to Long-Term Liabilities, the vulnerability thresholds correspond to the 90th percentile value of the
respective indicators for all firms within the same industry and across countries. By pooling by
industry and across time (2006-2016) and countries, we focus on industry-specific effects and
abstract from time and country effects. Similarly, for Quick Ratio, Return on Assets, and Market
to Book Ratio, the respective thresholds are equal to the 10th percentile value of the indicator by
industry.

We extend the notion of Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±å to multiple indicators which allows us to measure the ‚Äúintensity‚Äù
of debt at risk. We do so by focusing on debt of firms for which multiple indicators signal financial
vulnerability at the same time. The underlying assumption is that debt associated with firms that
are contemporaneously vulnerable according to multiple indicators is riskier. We operationalize
this notion by defining Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±Ö‚â•Ì†µÌ±ã . The Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±Ö‚â•Ì†µÌ±ã captures the proportion of total corporate debt in a

While Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±å provides useful information of vulnerable debt, Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±Ö‚â•Ì†µÌ±ã is designed to exhibit a
stronger signal-to-noise ratio compared to Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±å . The CVI is calculated as the average of Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±Ö‚â•Ì†µÌ±ã
for country c and time t:
                                                    1
                                       Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±âÌ†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±° = 7 ‚àë7
                                                       Ì†µÌ±ã=1(Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±Ö‚â•Ì†µÌ±ã )Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±° ,                      (8)
where 0 ‚â§ Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±âÌ†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±° ‚â§ 1.

The definition also has an intuitive graphical interpretation. As illustrated in Figure 3, the CVI is
equivalent to the normalized area under the Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±Ö‚â•Ì†µÌ±ã curve (area under blue line). At the extremes,
if no firm is financially vulnerable according to any indicator, then the value of the area under the
curve (and the CVI) is equal to zero (i.e. equivalent to the area under green line). In contrast, if all
firms are financially vulnerable with respect to all seven indicators at the same time, then the area

                                                                                         6
under the curve (and the value of CVI) would be equal to one (i.e. equivalent to the area under the
red line). In practice and as expected, the CVI has values well below one; the sample mean is 0.11
with a maximum of 0.36 (Table 2A).

             Figure 3: Corporate Vulnerability Index and Area Under the Curve




Our framework is underpinned by simplifying assumptions. The Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±Ö‚â•Ì†µÌ±ã concept does not
differentiate between indicators and treats them as interchangeable and of equal weight. While the
credit scoring literature referenced earlier focuses on assessing indicator weights, these models are
typically applied to a specific country or industry and require corporate default data. In the absence
of such data for a large sample of countries, and to ensure wide applicability and transparency of
the CVI, our approach is more pragmatic. Note also that the CVI de facto applies a greater weight
on the debt of more vulnerable firms since the area under the curve is cumulative (i.e. Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±Ö‚â•0 is
always 100 percent). In other words, the debt of a firm which is for example vulnerable according
to seven indicators weighs seven times more than of a firm which is vulnerable according to only
one indicator since it is represented in Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±Ö‚â•Ì†µÌ±ã for all values of X.

              3     Data
We use balance-sheet information of 14,273 listed non-financial companies from 8 industries and
96 EMDE countries between 2006 and 2016 for the construction of the CVI. We exclude countries
with less than five firms which reduces our sample to 14,207 firms in 69 countries.7 Bloomberg is
the source (see Figures 4.1 and 4.2).8

It is important to highlight a few data limitations. First, our sample only covers listed non-financial
firms. In most EMDEs listed firms are usually the biggest companies (by assets) and/or have better
access to funding sources. This may bias our results, but we believe that information from listed
companies which generally also follow better accounting practices nevertheless provides a good
proxy of the general health of the overall non-financial corporate sector, in particular with regards
to potential banking distress.9 Second, we do not have information about corporates‚Äô financial
information by currency and are therefore not able to accurately assess currency risks and external
vulnerabilities. This is a general concern, as neither Bloomberg nor any other data source
consistently collects this type of information on a cross-country basis. Finally, our data set does
not contain information on derivatives, other risk management tools and counterparties which
could be helpful to better understand exposures and transmission channels of corporate risk.

    The representativeness restriction of at least 5 firms in the database was not considered for calculating the CVI at country-industry level.

  Coverage across regions and industries is heterogeneous: 38% of companies in the dataset are from EAP region, 26% from ECA, 17% from SA,
7.4% from MENA, 6.7% from LAC, 4.3% from SSA. In addition, 31.3% of the sample are firms from Industrials, 22.5% from Consumer Goods,
13.5% from Basic Materials, 11.6% from Consumer Services, 7.2% from Energy, 5.6% from Technology, 4.7% from Health Care, and 1.2% from
Telecommunications.

  For instance, Gabaix (2011) highlights the importance of the firm‚Äôs size to explain shocks to the a ggregate output. This author states that
idiosyncratic shocks to large firms can lead to nontrivial aggregate shocks as modern economies are dominated by large corporations.

Our sample is not homogenous across regions (see Figure 4.3). The regional median of total
corporate debt (% of GDP) ranges from 2.9 percent of GDP for SSA to 10.8 percent of GDP for
EAP. The companies covered in our data set are nevertheless an important part of EMDEs‚Äô capital
markets as the median value of their common shares (i.e. % of stock market capitalization) ranges
from 17.6 percent in SSA to 61 percent in ECA (see Figure 4.4).

The financial indicators for listed non-financial firms in our sample shows downward trends in
debt service capacity, profitability, and market valuation across all regions (Figures 5.1, 5.2, and
5.3). In addition, leverage has increased in most regions except South Asia (SA) and East Asia and
Pacific (EAP), where leverage has been high, but decreasing. LAC and SSA have experienced a
steep increase in leverage since 2011/2012 (Figure 5.4). Based on an increasing Quick Ratio,
rollover risk has declined since the Global Financial Crisis, but ECA, SA, and SSA may be
vulnerable to adverse liquidity shocks as the quick ratio has been persistently below one (Figure
5.5).

  4.1 Trends in the Corporate Vulnerability Index
Debt of non-financial listed firms in EMDEs has increased in both level and riskiness (Figure 6):
EMDEs‚Äô corporate debt increased by 46 percent from $2.6 trillion to $3.8 trillion between 2010
and 2016. Over the same period, debt in the hands of firms considered vulnerable based on at least
one indicator grew by 120 percent from US $1 trillion to US $2.2 trillion. In 2016, about 58 percent
of debt was considered ‚Äòat risk‚Äô based on at least one indicator; 35 percent according to two or
more indicators; 12 percent based on three or more indicators; and 4 percent according to four or
more indicators.

At the global level, corporate vulnerability has increased sharply since 2013 according to our
CVI10, although the speed of deterioration has moderated, especially in 2016 (see Figure 7). The
global increase in corporate vulnerability has been driven by a rise in leverage ratios, and
deteriorations in profitability and debt service capacity. Corporate vulnerability has also deepened:
the country median value of DaR>=1 increased by 10.3 percentage points from 2013 to 2016, while
DaR>=2, DaR>=3, and DaR>=4 rose by 8.6, 2.7, and 0.14 percentage points, respectively (Figure 8).

Trends across regions have not been uniform. In ECA, corporate vulnerability increased
significantly in 2007 and has remained elevated since, while LAC has been experiencing a steep
rise in vulnerability since 2013. Corporate vulnerability in EMDEs was stable in 2016, but MENA
and SSA experienced some deterioration (Figure 9). The rise in corporate vulnerability in ECA
has been associated with low profitability, deteriorating debt service capacity, high leverage, and
increasing rollover risk. In LAC and MENA, increasing leverage ratios and deteriorating ICRs
were the main drivers of vulnerabilities since 2013/2014. In SSA, low profitability drove the rise

                                                                       12
in corporate vulnerability between 2014 and 2016. Figure 10 shows the intensity of corporate
vulnerabilities by region. The country median value of DaR>=1 increased for all regions between
2007 and 2016. ECA, SA, and SSA also experienced a rapid increase in the country medians of
DaR>=2 and DaR>=3, particularly between 2013 and 2016. In SA, ECA, and EAP, the country
median of DaR>=4 has increased, reaching values of 5.7%, 2.3%, and 1.7%, respectively.

At the country level, nine ECA countries are in the top 25 most vulnerable countries: companies
in those countries are characterized by high levels of DaR by indicators Leverage Ratio, Return on
Assets, and Quick Ratio. In addition, six MENA countries are in the top 25 most vulnerable
countries: firms in those countries are highly vulnerable due to their important levels of DaR
associated with Leverage (i.e. high DaR by both Leverage and Net Debt to EBIT ratios) and Debt
Service Capacity (i.e. DaR based on the ICR).11
The CVI has increased for several countries between 2009 and 2016: the median rise of the CVI
is 2.9 percentage points in that period. The non-financial corporate sectors of some regionally
important EMDEs such as Brazil, India, Russia, Nigeria, China, and Indonesia have also shown
weaker conditions, with a median CVI growth of 6 percentage points in the period 2009-2016.

   An analysis by industry shows that corporate financial vulnerability in MENA countries is highly concentrated in the Energy sector. Debt at Risk
by both Leverage and Net Debt to EBIT are above 95% of the total sectorial debt in 3 MENA countries, while Debt at Risk by ICR is above 60%
of the total sectorial debt also in 3 MENA countries.

At the industry level, corporate vulnerability has evolved unevenly over time: companies in basic
materials, consumer goods, consumer services, and industrials increased their vulnerabilities
during the financial crisis and this has continued since then. Energy, health care, and
telecommunications firms have faced sharp deterioration of their financial conditions since 2011-
2012, a period characterized by accommodative financial conditions and increasing corporate
leverage (Figure 12). Since 2014, with the end of the commodity super-cycle, financial conditions
for energy companies worsened and their CVI has been high.

     4.2Association between the Corporate Vulnerability Index and Socio-Economic
        Outcomes
Financial vulnerability in the non-financial corporate sector can have significant macroeconomic
consequences as corporate distress may adversely impact the financial sector (e.g. through
increases in non-performing loans, larger volatility of asset prices, rise of borrower risk); the public
sector (e.g. through lower tax revenues, potential public support in case of public non-financial
firms); other firms (e.g. through financial and/or trade interlinkages); and households (e.g. through
the labor market).12
This section investigates the leading indicator properties of the CVI with regards to socio-
economic outcomes. We use weighted logit regression models to establish whether an increase in
unemployment; a GDP recession; or a reduction in welfare are associated with an increase in the
Corporate Vulnerability Index CVIt, subject to controls (Xj):
                                                      Pr(Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñ = 1 | Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±âÌ†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±°‚àí1 , Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ó,Ì†µÌ±° )
The respective dependent variables of the three logit regressions are three dummy variables that
respectively take the value of 1 if (1) unemployment rate increases from one year to the next; (2)
annual GDP growth rate is negative (i.e., GDP recession); or (3) the annual per capita GDP is
negative (i.e., Welfare reduction), and zero otherwise.

The independent variables are the CVI and a set of control variables. We also include year
dummies and weigh each observation by the ratio of the total sum of common shares of the firms
in our sample to stock market capitalization in each country which we use as a proxy for the
representativeness of the CVI in a country. The CVI and control variables enter the regression
lagged by one period to ameliorate endogeneity concerns.
The macro-economic control variables are the current account balance, general government
balance, government debt, real GDP per capita, and inflation rate. We further control for the
commonly used DaR based on the ICR to test whether the CVI contains additional information.

Table 3 presents our logit regressions. Panel A show that the CVI is positively and statistically
significantly associated with future socio-economic outcomes. Panel B indicates that, once the
DaR based on ICR is included, the estimated coefficient of the CVI is still positive and statistically
significant in most cases. Importantly, the DaR based on ICR is not statistically significant,
suggesting that CVI has stronger predictive power for socio-economic outcomes. The CVI is
correctly signed in all model specifications and, with the exception of the welfare specification,
remains significant even when including macroeconomic controls.13
The first three columns of Panel A directly test the predictive power of the CVI. Panel A Column
1 shows that, based on the results of the marginal effects on the median, a one-unit increase of CVI
from the median is associated with a rise in the probability of unemployment by 1.78 percentage
points one year later.14 In other words, if CVI goes from its median value of 0.15 to 0.16, the
probability of unemployment rise will increase 0.0178 percentage points. Column 1 also shows
the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.73, which means
that the CVI has reasonable predictive accuracy for a future rise in unemployment.15
The results of Panel A Column 2 show that a one-unit increase of CVI from the median is
associated with an increase in the probability of a recession next year by 0.91 percentage points.
The AUC is 0.86 suggesting that the CVI has strong predictive accuracy power. Finally, Panel A
Column 3 establishes that the probability of welfare reduction (i.e., fall in GDP per capita) goes
up by 0.78 percentage points when the lagged CVI rises one unit from the median. The AUC is
0.81.
The last three columns of Panel A control for macroeconomic variables. The results indicate that
the coefficients of CVI are still positive and statistical significant. In other words, our CVI captures
relevant features related to the corporate sector which are distinct from general macroeconomic
conditions. As shown in Panel A column 4, the probability of a future rise in unemployment
increases by 1.36 percentage points when the CVI rises one unit from its median value. Similarly,
Panel A column 5 shows that the probability of a recession rises 1.02 percentage points when CVI
goes up one unit from its median. The AUC increase to a very high 0.9 when macroeconomic
variables are included. Finally, Panel A column 6 shows that the probability of a welfare reduction
rises 0.66 percentage points with a change in CVI in one unit from the median. Interestingly, the
AUC is only marginally affected by the inclusion of macroeconomic controls, suggesting that the
model‚Äôs predictive classification power is mostly derived from the CVI.
Panel B shows that the coefficients of CVI are still positive and statistical significant after
including the commonly used DaR based on ICR which is insignificant in all specifications. This
13
    Information for Macedonia is not included in the logit estimations for unemployment rise as the dynamics of unemployment in that country in
recent years are explained by policies targeting vocational training and on-the-job training under different government stimulus programs. As
explained by the IMF‚Äôs Article IV (2016b), Macedonia has one of the highest unemployment rates in emerging Europe ( 25.4% in 2016), mostly
reflecting skills shortage and mismatch resulting from emigration of skilled workers and low level of education. Since 2008, overall unemployment
rate has declined by 10 percentage points, with lower unemployment rates in groups like workers with vocational training and tertiary education.
14
    In logit models, as the sign and significance of the estimated coefficients are important to determine the statistical relationship between the
probability of the outcome (in this case unemployment rise) and the independent variables, the values of the coefficients have a difficult
interpretation in economic terms. The coefficients of the marginal effects have an economic interpretation as they measure the change in predicted
probability of outcome when the independent variables change in one unit.
15
    The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is a measure that that reflects how well a model is able to correctly
classify a binary outcome variable. The ROC compares the proportion of cases in which the model specification correctly predicts the result of the
outcome variable (i.e. true positive rate) versus the proportion of cases in which the model specification incorrectly predicts the result of the outcome
variable (i.e. false positive rate). The AUC goes from 0 to 1, where the value 0 represents that the true positive rate is 0 percent and the false positive
rate is 100 percent, and a value of 1 represents that the true positive rate is 100 percent and the false positive rate is 0 percent. The closer the AUC
is to 1, the better the model. The AUC of a random classifier is 0.5.

                                                                           18
finding suggests that the CVI contains empirically relevant additional information compared to the
DaR based on ICR. Note that the correlation between DaR based on ICR and the CVI is relatively
high (0.71). However, the size of the CVI coefficient and statistical significance do not change
dramatically (with the exception of Column 6) due to the inclusion of the DaR based on ICR,
suggesting collinearity is not an overriding concern.

       5    Sensitivity Analysis to Different ICR Thresholds
Our results are consistent under different thresholds for ICR. Using ICR thresholds 1.5, 2, and 3,
we recalculated the CVI to evaluate how sensitive our results are to thresholds commonly used in
the literature (FSB, 2015; IMF, 2017).
As shown in the Appendix, Table B1, the country ranking does not have much variability under
different ICR thresholds, particularly for both the top 10 and the bottom 15 countries. In addition,
Tables B2, B3, and B4 show the logit regressions for unemployment rise, recession, and welfare
reduction, respectively, using the CVI modified by different levels of ICR thresholds. The results
show that the estimated coefficient for the CVI is positive and statistical significant in all cases.

       6    Conclusion
Using firms‚Äô balance-sheet information for 69 Emerging Markets and Developing Economies
(EMDEs), this paper introduces the Corporate Vulnerability Index (CVI), which provides a
framework to monitor financial conditions of the non-financial corporate sector. The CVI employs
seven indicators for which data are readily available that capture four aspects of firms‚Äô financial
vulnerabilities: debt service capacity, leverage, rollover risk, and return-to-market value.
The Corporate Vulnerability Index suggests that vulnerabilities have increased sharply since 2013,
but have stabilized in 2016. At the global level, increased leverage ratio and deteriorations in
profitability and debt service capacity were the main drivers behind corporate vulnerability. But
global trends mask regional diversity. Corporate vulnerability in Eastern Europe and Central Asia
has been elevated since 2007, while Latin America experienced a steep increase in vulnerability
since 2013. Corporate vulnerability in EMDEs has been stable in 2016, but the Middle East and
Sub-Saharan Africa have shown deterioration. Relative to 2009, financial conditions in the non-
financial corporate sector have deteriorated in several EMDEs. However, if currently relatively
benign global funding conditions and higher commodity prices endure, companies may have an
opportunity to strengthen their balance sheets.
At the industry level, we find that energy-linked sectors in particular have experienced rising
financial vulnerabilities; especially since 2014 peak in global oil prices. We also find that debt of
non-financial listed firms in EMDEs has increased both in level and in riskiness: EMDEs‚Äô
corporate debt rose by 46 percent, from US $2.6 trillion in 2010 to US $3.8 trillion in 2016. Over
the same period, debt in the hands of firms that are considered financially vulnerable in at least
one indicator grew by 120 percent, from US $1 trillion to US $2.2 trillion. In 2016, approximately
58 percent is considered at risk according to at least one indicator.
Logit regressions suggests that the CVI has some leading indicator qualities: an increase in the
CVI is positively associated with a future rise in unemployment and an economic recession.
Results are robust to controlling for macroeconomic conditions. The CVI also outperforms the
commonly used Debt at Risk measure based on the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR).
As financial vulnerabilities in non-financial corporate sectors of many EMDEs appear to be
growing, it seems important to consider the efficiency of the EMDEs‚Äô institutional and policy
frameworks to monitor vulnerabilities and to deal with distressed firms in case that adverse shocks
materialize. For instance, it is unknown whether recently established macroprudential frameworks
to monitor corporate debt are effective. In addition, inadequate regulatory frameworks like
deficient insolvency regimes, poor financial institutions to deal with non-performing loans in the
banking sector, or macro policies that discourage hedging of firms‚Äô foreign currency positions
might work as amplifiers of adverse shocks. Consequently, policies aimed at minimizing corporate
vulnerabilities and controlling their spillover effects as well as the legal framework providing a
diverse ‚Äúmenu‚Äù of options for ailing firms to obtain efficient financial restructuring, are vital
elements of a strategy to improve the resilience of EMDEs‚Äô corporate sector to adverse shocks.

The Corporate Vulnerability Index (CVI) ranges from 0 (i.e., firms are not financially vulnerable in any of the 7 indicators) to 1 (i.e., all firms are financially vulnerable in all 7 indicators). The CVI
calculated for 69 countries, covering 14.207 firms. For CVI calculation, countries require to have 5 or more firms in the database.
YoY Change of CVI: percentage change of CVI between 2015 and 2016. Red: change of CVI in the highest tercile across countries. Green: change of CVI in the lowest tercile across countries. DaR >=X
denotes the Debt at Risk in "X or more indicators": debt of financially vulnerable firms in X or more indicators as a share of reported tota l corporate debt, where X=1,2,‚Ä¶,7. DaR denotes the Debt at Risk
regarding a particular indicator.

                                                        Energy

The NLTA was instrumental in strengthening the institutional environment, policy and operational framework for
Odisha state to move towards clean renewable energy generation. These will act as a catalyst to steer Odisha away
from a fossil-fuel dominant energy production and consumption pattern, and shift the energy-mix towards clean and
renewable sources.

Since Energy is an infrastructure intensive and capital heavy business, the early policy and strategic guidance, capacity
building and operational roadmap provided by the NLTA facilitated GoO’s ambitious plan to add 2,750 MW of energy
capacity from renewable sources by 2022, instead of going the fossil-fuel way that was more familiar to them.

The NLTA also helped the State implement the proposed state actions under the policy on time and keep on track to
achieve such an ambitious renewable energy addition. The land bank created through the NLTA identified and
assessed government owned or waste lands available for large-scale solar projects up to 1,000 MW out of the
targeted 2,200 MW from solar addition under the policy. The NLTA has provided a way to easily identify future
opportunities for renewable energy development through a transparent information database of potential public and
waste lands.

Because of successful identification of potential solar park sites, Odisha was also included in the National Solar Park
Development Initiative, which the World Bank is supporting under the Shared Infrastructure for Solar Parks Project.
This enables the state to qualify for concessional financing to develop a total 1,000 MW solar park through
bilateral/multilateral development banks as well as for additional funding through the Government of India (GoI).
Furthermore, IFC agreed to provide its transaction advisory support for 1,000MW solar park development, building on
the early success of policy formulation and land bank assessment.

The NLTA’s information dissemination activities helped build awareness in the other stakeholders about the vision,
policy and steps being taken by the GoO. Especially on the private sector engagement part, the NLTA helped engage
with potential investors and private players early on to understand their challenges / concerns and mitigate risks, to
facilitate a successful Renewable Energy PPP.



                                         Climate Change and Environment

The NLTA conducted the first stocktaking exercise of the SCAP among States as the World Bank did to help Odisha
become the first state to publish the SCAP in 2010. This resulted in the development of the State Climate Change
Action Plan 2015-2020 to address the gaps and to establish measurable, actionable goals and timetables for
implementation of a robust operational action plan for the following five years.
Based on the stocktaking exercise, SCAP 2015-20 contains:

       49 specific actions to enable the state to design investments aiding adaptation;

       11 actions that have both resilience/mitigate and adaptive features; and

       22 GHG reduction strategies across sectors.




                                                                                                                        5
                                         Climate Change and Environment
A summary of sector-wise prioritized action plan are as follows:

 Sector          Prioritized Action

 Management

As a result of the assessment of the financial needs and gaps, a strategy to access sources other than state budgetary
allocations was developed. This has resulted in successfully accessing the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for a “Ground
water recharge and solar micro irrigation? project that ensures food security and enhances resilience in vulnerable
tribal areas. The NLTA was instrumental in winning an early approval of this proposal from the GCF board. While this is
one of the firsts, this project will serve as a model for further climate finance access and supplement GoO’s own
budgetary allocations.

The NLTA also resulted in drafting a long-term low carbon conscious growth strategy in SCAP 2015-2020, by providing
a decision support tool to assess GHG emission scenarios by different scenarios and commitment on low carbon
conscious growth. Given that states will assume increasingly important and critical role in implementing Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC), this tool helps in planning stage to understand long term GHG emission impact with

                                                                                                                      6

    different level of mitigation targets and measures.

    The NLTA also worked with the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) to develop a state environmental rating
    and disclosure program and made Odisha become the first state in India to start ranking its pollution intensive
    industries.



                                                                      Urban Planning

    The Local Resilience Action Plans (LRAPs) for Bhubaneshwar, Cuttack and at the State Level, produced as a deliverable
    under the NLTA, aligned the cities’ needs to their visions and growth aspirations to attract investments and promote
    economic growth. The LRAP considered the risks and vulnerabilities arising from natural hazards along with the
    projected impacts of climate change and suggested various structural and non-structural measures to improve urban
    resilience. These measures will make sure that in case of a natural disaster, there is no loss of life and minimum
    damage to infrastructure, despite the high population & infrastructure density of urban areas.
    The resulting priority interventions suggested for improving urban resilience are:

        1) Integrated Flood Management

             - restoration of ponds to hold excess rainfall runoff and flood water

             - creation of rainfall infiltration or harvesting facilities and permeable pavements, multi-purpose flood facility
             centres and injection wells to help absorb a portion of excess rainfall runoff and help the flood water to flow
             off

        2) Risk Resilient Urban Planning and Development

             - construction of resilient and affordable housing for urban slums

             - updating of building bylaws and development control regulations

             - integrating risk sensitive land use planning in city master plans, urban flood management to address location
             specific problems

    The NLTA also helped pave the way to improve the current energy utilization efficiency in urban areas so that energy
    wastage can be minimized both in short and long term, regardless of the renewable or non-renewable source. This is
    even more important at this point of time as the energy consumption demand is expected to soar and it is essential
    that any new infrastructure integrates energy efficient design principles and focuses on energy conservation.

    By using the Tool for Rapid Assessment of City Energy (TRACE)1, the NLTA quickly helped identify key areas that have
    energy saving potential across key energy intensive sectors in cities and develop a comprehensive energy efficiency
    strategy for the State. To set direction towards successful execution, the NLTA also developed a concept note for
    Implementation of Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) in Odisha.

    Taking into account recommendations provided by LRAP and TRACE, Bhubaneshwar was recently judged 1st in the
    Smart Cities Initiatives led by GoI2. The NLTA was instrumental in making Bhubaneshwar fare well on a lot of
    evaluation parameters & hence contributed to the top rank. Some example evaluation parameters where the NLTA

    helped are:
            At least 10% of city electricity supply coming from solar;

            Smart metering and Energy Efficient Street Lighting; and

            At least 80% buildings should be green and energy efficient.



                                             Agriculture, Fisheries, Forest and Panchayati Raj3

    The highly vulnerable areas and communities to climate change were identified to be given early attention, through
    the NLTA’s Climate Hazard and Vulnerability mapping exercise where 107 single indicator GIS maps and 36 combined
    maps were developed. This facilitated identification of targeted spatial interventions that support both livelihoods
    and address climate risks. The prioritized communities are:
            Communities dependant on rain fed agriculture;

            Forest dependent communities who are vulnerable to climate risks and face many pressures including dam
             construction, mining and forest clearance for settlement; and

            Poor coastal fishing communities vulnerable to cyclones.

    The NLTA followed an integrated investment approach on key areas of agriculture, coastal zones and disasters, forests
    and water resources. The resulting priority investment project pilots initiated in 4 districts as mentioned below, will
    help test and learn what works and what doesn’t. This is an extremely important step, before devising and
    implementing any state-wide program – both from an effectiveness and resource utilization efficiency point of view.
            Balasore - Mangrove rehabilitation & development of sustainable livelihoods for fishing communities

            Bolangir - Climate smart agriculture project / irrigation project

            Kandhamal - Upscaling of producer to market networks for horticultural products and Holistic forest
             watershed management project

            Sundargarh - Holistic forest watershed management project

    These proposed investment projects promote an ecosystem based adaptation (EBA) which can offer cost-effective
    options for addressing climate change vulnerabilities. They need to be detailed and developed further by the
    concerned departments potentially with the World Bank support and the institutional, organizational and
    administrative arrangements made need to be finalized.

2. Objective
The purpose of this document is to summarize the activities, outcomes and impact made by the World Bank’s
Non-Lending Technical Assistance (NLTA) to the Government of Odisha from 2014-17. This document is a part of the
formal closure process of the NLTA ending June 30th, 2017.




3. Introduction to the NLTA
In a first such request of its kind from an Indian state, Government of Odisha (GoO) requested World Bank’ s
Non-Lending Technical Assistance (NLTA) for implementation of its State Climate Change Action Plan (SCAP).

Odisha state is highly vulnerable to climate change owing to a vulnerable coast line, rain-fed agriculture, droughts, saline
water intrusion, forest degradation and periodic natural disasters such as cyclones and flooding. Odisha will also become
one of the largest contributors of Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in India due to the growing energy needs. This will
also adversely impact community livelihoods and intensify water and vector borne diseases.

To overcome these challenges, the SCAP laid out a state-wide five-year plan (2010-2015) with priority actions in 11
sectors. (Refer Annexure 1 for a list of these actions)




Considering the above, the NLTA aimed to help implement the SCAP through strategic planning, investments,
institutional reforms, and development of financing options beyond state and central resources. The NLTA also aimed to
help GoO make climate change and environmental sustainability decisions in the medium to long run and build a carbon
conscious and a climate resilient development path in the state.

The NLTA focussed on the following activity areas:
    (A) Stocktaking of SCAP 2010-15 and supporting development of SCAP 2015-20
    (B) Piloting innovations for a low carbon and climate resilient growth of Odisha
    (C) Supporting institutional preparedness for SCAP and beyond

4. NLTA Activity Areas
    A. Stocktaking of SCAP 2010-15 and supporting development of SCAP 2015-20
Activities and Deliverables

Since 2011, the SCAP implementation had been slow, with little documentation of progress made. The NLTA assessed:

       progress on implementation of key SCAP actions (both adaptation and mitigation); and

       the current financing available from the state and central governments.
1) Progress Assessment

The NLTA conducted the first stock taking exercise with the Climate Change Cell mandated to track the progress for
the SCAP. This was crucial because it helped identify the baseline, progress and next steps for prioritization and
improvements so that the SCAP outcomes can be achieved in time.
2) Financial Assessment

The state’s investments and budget allocations indicate that investments on projects related to climate change are
increasing, to a 4% of 2014-15 budget from a 3.3% in 2013-14. The actual figures are likely to be higher as the 4%
figure does not consider cross-sector investments made through the national mission (the Mahatma Gandhi National
Rural Employment Guarantee Act: MGNREGA), etc. that have significant climate related benefits.

Based on 2014-15 budgets, the total climate change related investment is INR 4285.46 Crore, of which, 52% has been
earmarked for mitigation, 40% for adaptation and the remaining 8% for actions that can be classified as both
mitigation and adaptation.




The financing assessment revealed the following gap:
                                                                                                                10
    A. Stocktaking of SCAP 2010-15 and supporting development of SCAP 2015-20




Since the state had, thus far, relied on its own resources to finance the SCAP implementation, the NLTA assessment
helped make a case for developing a strategic plan to access non-traditional financial sources, so that the total
financing needs could be met.

As a result -

       Odisha was recently included in the National Solar Park Development Initiative, which the World Bank is
        supporting under the Shared Infrastructure for Solar Parks Project. This enables the state to qualify for
        concessional financing to develop a total 1,000 MW solar park through bilateral/multilateral development
        banks as well as for additional funding through the GoI.

       GCF approved funding for a “Ground water recharge and solar micro irrigation? project that ensures food
        security and enhances resilience in vulnerable tribal areas of Odisha.
Recommendations

1) Need for newer financial sources

As identified in the financial assessment mentioned above, the state government’s own resources won’t suffice for
SCAP implementation. Hence there is a need to access non-traditional financial sources from governments, donors,
and multilateral agencies. While there has been one project financed through the GCF after NLTA support, climate
financing such as GCF could be utilized for more projects. Similar models could be replicated for accessing and
engaging with multilateral agencies, especially for the Energy and Forest and Environment part of the SCAP, since the
financial gap is the largest.

2) Need for Data/ Measurement related processes

The NLTA assessment also made evident a strong need for establishing and standardizing data collection, analysis and
reporting processes within the state departments so that the expenditure and outcomes can be measured accurately.

       To monitor the correlation between expenditure and outcomes, the Climate Change Cell must develop
        guidelines for all departments so that the data collection can be internalized within the respective monitoring
        and evaluations processes

       Whilst the Climate Change Cell has developed an internal reporting and analysis format, it must be
                                                                                                                     11
    A. Stocktaking of SCAP 2010-15 and supporting development of SCAP 2015-20
        standardized within the budgeting and reporting routines of all departments.

3) Need for longer-term approach to stocktaking because 3-5 year investments plans are not sufficient to accurately
   analyse adaptation capability outcomes.

4) Need for capacity building on climate change issues by associating with the administrative training institute of the
   state wherein focused training and technical assistance can be delivered for more effective mainstreaming of the
   SCAP.

5) Need for developing a knowledge hub for continued stakeholder engagement: The Climate Change Cell must be
   developed into a more robust knowledge hub so that more effective support can be rendered to departments.



    B. Piloting innovations for a low carbon and climate resilient growth of Odisha
Activities and Deliverables

1) Prioritization of Key SCAP Activities

The NLTA prioritized key activities under SCAP by applying rigorous technical criteria such as urgency, constraints, and
resources across sectors. The NLTA fine-tuned key actions by sector and proposed a time-bound implementation
strategy with the Climate Change Cell and nodal departments.

This activity was crucial in achieving faster progress in SCAP implementation because initially the SCAP had not
identified sectoral strategies or city-level plans, implementation plans, cost of the specific actions, or funding sources.
For a massive transformational and cross-sectoral initiative like the SCAP to succeed timely, prioritization based on a
cost-benefit analysis, leveraging all possible financial sources and having a detailed implementation strategy is
essential.
2) Development of Local Resilience Action Plans (LRAP) for Odisha state, Bhubaneswar, and Cuttack

LRAPs are action plans prepared by the city/ state with support from the Bank to reduce vulnerability to natural
hazards and climate change and contains a series of practical actions (investments and soft measures) that can be
implemented by the Government to become more resilient. Considering Odisha’s urban population growth (26.8%),
emergence of Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, and Puri as key economic areas, and the fact that these cities are vulnerable to
cyclone, urban flooding, heat waves and earthquakes, development of LRAPs and their effective implementation
becomes crucial. Also, owing to climate change and global warming – not only are risks of these natural hazards
increasing, but also the magnitude of their impact. For example, residential buildings in Bhubaneswar could lose up to
US$ 75 million, only from cyclones. This further necessitates the development and implementation of LRAPs for the
state government.

Each LRAPs (for the state, and for the cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack) contains assessment of: i) climate change
and impact scenarios; ii) vulnerability and risk, iii) various organizations involved in disaster recovery and climate
change adaptation; and iv) ongoing risk mitigation activities undertaken by the GoO and other agencies. The hazard
risk assessment exercise identified both Bhubaneswar and Cuttack municipalities as highly vulnerable to cyclone,
urban flooding and vulnerable to heat waves and having moderate risk of earthquake. While Bhubaneswar was found
to be vulnerable to urban flood, Cuttack was found to be vulnerable to riverine as well as urban flood. The risk
assessment exercise has identified vulnerable hotspots within the cities. As an outcome, several structural and
non-structural interventions are suggested to improve urban resilience - while most of the structural measures
suggested are specific to the cities or to certain localities, non-structural interventions are mostly at State and city

   B. Piloting innovations for a low carbon and climate resilient growth of Odisha
levels. These are integrated flood management and risk resilient urban planning and development that are detailed in
the recommendations section below.
3) Energy efficiency improvements in cities

The Tool for Rapid Assessment of City Energy (TRACE) was used for an energy diagnostic in three cities - Bhubaneswar,
Cuttack, and Puri to understand energy efficiency opportunities. The building, potable water and transport sectors
were identified as the most promising in terms of state ownership, ongoing policy work, and readiness for potential
energy efficiency interventions as well as with regards to replication and energy savings potential.
4) Maximization of the use of renewables

   a) Developing low carbon strategy and policy for implementation of RE projects

   The NLTA supported GoO in promoting renewable energy by helping prepare a low carbon strategy covering key
   sectors, building on the actions identified in SCAP. Given that 95% of renewable energy potential is still
   untapped and private investment is not fully mobilized to promote renewable energy, the NLTA detailed out a
   roadmap and policy for implementation of RE projects in the State between 2016-2022.

   The resulting Odisha Renewable Energy Policy (2016-2022) was approved by the State Cabinet in November 2016
   after a series of consultations with stakeholders. The overall target for renewable energy capacity addition over
   policy period for the State is 2,750 MW –
                                                                                          Waste to
                                                          Small                           Energy
    Technology          Solar              Wind           Hydro           Biomass         (WTE)
    New Target(MW)      2,200              200            150             180             20


   b) Capacity building of Key State Institutions

   The NLTA also contributed to operationalizing the Green Energy Development Corporation (GEDCOL) by
   developing an operationalized plan and the institutional arrangements therein to support low-carbon
   development as per the renewable energy roadmap that the NLTA supported. It also helped strengthen the
   functioning of Grid Corporation of Odisha Limited (GRIDCO). These capacity building activities will help these key
   institutions achieve the state targets by 2022.
   c) Developing a Land Bank Database

   A land bank database was developed to identify non-agricultural, non-forest land blocks available for solar project
   development in each district of Odisha. This helped identify potential sites for development of Solar Park/Hybrid
   Park with Solar and Wind projects. Land procurement has been one of the biggest challenges faced by private
   developers because of its potential to cause delays and cost overruns on projects. Odisha has non-agricultural
   government land that can be utilized for renewable-energy development. However, due to the lack of availability
   of site information, it has been difficult for private-sector developers to tap into such resources in a cost-effective
   manner, a problem this land bank will solve.

   The NLTA also contributed to develop specific and detailed parameters to categorize and prioritize the identified
   public and waste land sites and shortlisted two sites after the detailed techno commercial evaluation to assess
   potential feasibility of solar parks.


                                                                                                                        13
    B. Piloting innovations for a low carbon and climate resilient growth of Odisha

5) Improving resilience and reducing the vulnerability of the poor

The NTLA supported the development of Climate Hazard and Vulnerability maps in the four demonstration districts:
Balasore, Bolangir, Kandhamal and Sundargarh. The maps facilitate the identification of targeted spatial interventions
that both support livelihoods and address climate risks. Given the diversity of climate risk and socio-economic
conditions across the state, it is clear that not all areas and communities will be equally impacted. Understanding the
spatial dimension of livelihoods and climate risk is therefore key to developing effective interventions.

There are clear synergies, in terms of reducing the vulnerabilities of the poor to climate change and sustaining
livelihoods, with ongoing investments undertaken by the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries, Forest/Environment
and Panchayati Raj. Based on initial discussion with key departments and the findings of the Climate Hazard and
Vulnerability mapping work, potential investment projects which could be supported through a World Bank loan were
identified. The projects identified in this initial Climate Change and Livelihoods Project Plan address representative
climate hazards, vulnerabilities and geographical areas. Their implementation could serve as pilot/ demonstration
projects, which if replicated at scale could lead to transformational change.
Recommendations

1) Need for Integrated flood management
    a) Pond restoration: both Bhubaneshwar and Cuttack have several ponds which are silted, reducing their water
       holding capacity drastically. These ponds, if de-silted, can act as local reservoirs to hold excess rainfall runoff
       and flood water.
    b) Restoration of secondary and tertiary drains connecting to the primary drains that are being renovated.
    c) Rainfall infiltration (harvesting) facilities and permeable pavements : the design and construction of the
       cities’ infrastructure facilities need to consider flood risk and mainstream flood control in all construction
       activities. This includes infiltration ponds, and permeable pavements, which can help absorb a portion of
       excess rainfall runoff and flood water.
    d) Multi-purpose flood facility centres: Design of open spaces like playgrounds and other public spaces as
       retardation ponds. This may require excavating playgrounds to help flood waters flow in local catchments
       through gravity.
    e) Injection wells: Potential for development of injection wells, which can help drain out flood water and at the
       same time recharge ground water aquifers, which are depleting particularly in Cuttack city. This needs
       geological investigations and selecting appropriate locations for injection wells.


2) Need for risk resilient urban planning and development
    a) Resilient and affordable housing for urban slums: Some centrally sponsored slum rehabilitation projects are
       being developed by these cities. Design interventions are needed for these buildings to be cost effective and
       resilient to hazards particularly to earthquake, cyclone, and heat wave.
    b) Building bylaws and development control regulations: The building bylaws and development control
       regulations need to be updated based on hazard risks and climate change impacts.

    c) City Master plan: Integrating risk sensitive land use planning in the city Master plans. The proposed


                                                                                                                        14
    B. Piloting innovations for a low carbon and climate resilient growth of Odisha
        development and land use zoning of 2030 need to consider hazard risks and impacts of climate change.

    d) Urban flood management: integrated flood management approach needs to be taken to address
       location-specific problems.

3) Need for development of a state-wide energy efficiency strategy

The TRACE assessment helped identify public and residential buildings, potable water and public transport sectors as
promising areas. It also revealed that energy use in Indian cities is handled by a variety of governing departments.
Hence full control over energy efficiency opportunities is spread over a vast jurisdiction, making it difficult to
concentrate interventions at a city level.

Therefore, to strengthen the energy efficiency mandate and clearly define time-bound energy efficiency objectives
(that will inform the capital investment planning for the 13th EIC 5-year plan), the development of a state-wide
energy efficiency strategy is needed. The Electrical Engineer-in-Chief, SDA could be entrusted with development,
implementation and monitoring of this strategy, working across departments and governance levels.

4) Need for assessing and developing the potential lending projects identified in initial Climate Change and
   Livelihoods Project Plan

The priority investment projects require further site specific fine-tuning and assessment at the village / community
level to better understand the socio-economic conditions of communities and to determine which communities
should be supported as a priority. After this step, the institutional, organizational and administrative arrangements for
the investment projects need to be agreed upon.

The initial Climate Change and Livelihoods project plan covers only four districts. A climate risk and vulnerability
mapping of all districts of Odisha is needed for a broader strategy and implementation.

The initial Climate Change and Livelihoods Project Plan has focused on agriculture, coastal zones and disasters, forests
and water resources, and related departments associated with livelihoods. However, it is important to recognize that
climate resilient livelihoods and poverty alleviation are cross cutting issues, and ultimately actions across all sectors
should be screened for their impact, using a high level multi criteria analysis (MCA) screening tool.



    C. Supporting institutional preparedness for SCAP and beyond
Activities and Deliverables

1) Capacity building for the Climate Change Cell (CCC)

GoO created a Climate Change Cell (CCC) to oversee the progress and liaise with the Government of India, external
funding agencies and different sectors for the smooth implementation of the SCAP. The NLTA focused on
strengthening the capacity of the CCC through:

       better articulation of the role, mission and vision of the CCC and the climate change nodal officers;

       review of similar institutional arrangements in other states for best-practices;

       assisting in training/capacity building through participation in international conferences/seminars/workshops;

                                                                                                                       15
       and

      supporting the preparation of the second iteration of the SCAP 2015-2020.


2) Development of Odisha Energy Security Scenario 2047 tool

An energy and GHG emission scenario building tool for the State of Odisha, which explores a range of potential future
scenarios for the State, was developed to compare possible energy futures across:

      energy supply sectors such as solar, wind, biofuels, oil, gas, coal, and nuclear; and

      energy demand sectors such as transport, industry, agriculture, cooking, and lighting and appliances.

The tool allows users to interactively make energy choices, and explore a range of outcomes for the State in the
context of GHG emissions, water availability issue and land use change within the state.
3) Support of an environmental rating and disclosure program for Odisha State Pollution Control Board

The NLTA supported design and launch of an environmental rating and disclosure program that includes performance
criteria for environmental impacts targeting energy intensive high polluting industries, mines and thermal power
plants. It has helped institute the public performance rating scheme for industries (ECAMRA) and in developing
performance indicators and a robust monitoring program and as well as in capacity building for improved
self-reporting based on the international standards.

The NLTA organized a study tour to Ghana and Indonesia for environmental regulators and senior policy-makers from
the GoO in 2015. This helped them learn about Environmental Rating and Disclosure (ERD) Programs and created a
3-country network of environmental regulators who can continue to share the lessons of implementation of their ERD
programs.
Recommendations

1) The following activities should be initiated and completed:

      Using the existing environmental ratings web platform of the international consultants, customize and deploy:
       a) data entry web-interface for companies to report self-monitoring data directly into the ECAMRA’s
       integrated database system. This data will include environmental parameters at the point-specific level as well
       the company totals for water and energy use; b) An online environmental audit and inspections data
       management system; and c) A desktop application for computerized evaluation of environmental rating of
       companies;

      Help evaluate the final environmental ratings for public disclosure; and

      Help prepare communications plan and a public website for the disclosure of ratings to the media and the
       public.

2) Further evolve the decision support tool (Odisha Energy Security Scenario 2047 tool) by adding a feature to show
   financial implications of the chosen scenarios, so that the user can understand how much it will cost to meet the
   different GHG paths. This will help make more well-informed decisions by considering the cost and financial
   feasibility as well.


                                                                                                                    16
    3) More cross-departmental engagement by the CCC through:
           establishment of inter-departmental data collection standards so that CCC can analyse the collected data and
            monitor KPIs;

           knowledge generation and dissemination activities to mainstream SCAP 2015-20 goals (and how to achieve
            them) in the activities of all possible departments; and

           sharing of best-practices and tools developed for the purpose with all departments and training them to use
            them effectively in their respective planning processes

    Support in these areas will help Odisha to develop its adaptation response prudently, measuring effectiveness
    periodically, while putting in place institutions and procedures to both increase resilience and the ability to respond to
    the more dramatic changes.




5. NLTA Outreach Activities
The SCAP progress report was released in a ceremony hosted by the Odisha Chief Minister in 2015.4 This helped the
NLTA get institutional visibility within the GoO departments and helped in further engagement with them. While the
NLTA majorly worked with GoO, the larger impact envisioned in the policies and action plan cannot be achieved without
involving the private sector and the public. For successful implementation of SCAP, it is essential to have an early
engagement with the private sector and all other stakeholders – to share the vision and action plan, gather inputs in the
participation barriers to be removed and risks to be mitigated.

For the same purpose, consultations, workshops, and seminars were organized during the course of preparation of NLTA
deliverables across sectors. These events helped not only improve the quality of deliverables but also sensitise the
industries, NGOs, academia, and communities on the important aspects of SCAP and outcome from its implementation
in the state.

For example, the consultation and dissemination workshops held for development and announcement of the state
renewable energy policy with the support from NLTA helped confirm GoO’s commitment to RE promotion and the steps
it is taking to make private sector engagement easier, such as providing land acquisition and other infra support,
co-financing and other technical assistance to encourage and de-risk private investment. They also provided clarity on
commercial terms and potential of the business the private sector could expect to build and grow, and how GoO plans to
facilitate the process.




6. Conclusion
The NLTA has helped the GoO progressed the implementation of SCAP, by stocktaking of the SCAP 2010-15, assessing
achievements, gaps and finances, and preparing the next SCAP for 2015-20. It also helped the GoO strategize and
implement a low carbon & climate resilient growth through LRAPs, vulnerability mapping, TRACE assessments and
capacity building for the state departments and agencies such as GEDCOL. The NLTA further helped the institutional

preparedness for SCAP and beyond, through the energy security scenario decision support tool and design, launch of the
environmental rating and disclosure program and capacity building of the climate change cell. Areas needing policy and
regulatory intervention were identified and supported as for the case of renewable energy development. Municipalities
also got implementation support through identification of investment areas, prioritized communities and pilots to be
done through LRAPs and TRACE . Based on the success and learnings from the NLTA, GoO is now in a better position to
iterate, refine and scale solutions to the whole state for a greater impact.

After the NLTA engagement, there is a stronger awareness at all levels of the GoO administration about the risks posed
by climate change to the State’s social and economic development. This helps integrate climate change resilience as a
necessary dimension in planning all their policies and activities. When multiple cross-sectoral schemes’, seemingly small,
individual climate resilience efforts will converge, the impact achieved will be reinforced and multiplied.

However, despite defining policies and creating institutions for the purpose, the progress made thus far, is far from
satisfactory. A lot remains to be done towards successfully integrating climate resilience in the broader economic and
sectoral agenda, to scale and cover the entire state. The financial and fiscal aspects of building resilience have received
limited attention. To move fast, effectively and holistically – GoO needs to keep sourcing funds from multiple sources by
leveraging multilaterals / donors and national funds to supplement its own.

Managing climate risks proactively, responsibly and effectively could bring about a sense of security and a means of
progress to people, especially the most vulnerable ones. At the same time, rather than being a unique burden on the
State, building climate resilience could prove to be opportunity for technological, institutional and societal innovations,
and more sustainable investments, all associated with economic and societal gains.

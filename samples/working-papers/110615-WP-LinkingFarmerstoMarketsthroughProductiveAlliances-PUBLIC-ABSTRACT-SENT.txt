potential misunderstandings and conflicts
should be avoided and it is highly
important that all parties comply with
the agreed (written or unwritten) terms
of the business plan. Thus, PA projects
conditioned on the identification of a
specific buyer are more straightforward as
they require the involvement of this buyer
in the implementation of the business
plan from the beginning. In other words,
while a formal upfront agreement can
foster and clarify the specifications of
a vertical alliance between producers
and buyers, its success depends
on the commitment of the alliance
partners to act on this agreement
during project implementation.

Buyer targeting differs across PA projects, as illustrated by the list of eligibility criteria from four projects:

Bolivia PAR I & II: (i) purchase commitment between buyer and producer organization; (ii) at least two years of
experience in the national market; (iii) legally established and with proven commercial infrastructure; and, (iv) clear
technical specifications (quantity, quality, terms, conditions of storage, packaging and other related to the specificity of
each product marketed).

Colombia PAAP I & II: One or more buyers who demonstrate: (i) competence; (ii) experience; (iii) financial strength; and,
(iv) a commitment to buy all or at least 70% of the products from the alliance.

Guatemala PDER: (i) a national or international company specialized in the production and sale of goods and services;
(ii) prepared to co-invest with partners in Guatemala to establish a long term commercial relationship; (iii) has good and
reliable distribution channels; and, (iv) economically, financially and legally solvent.

Panama PRORURAL: Agro-processor or wholesale agent with: (i) experience in the specific products; (ii) willing and
able to contribute to the alliance with financial resources or in kind (e.g., through technical assistance); (iii) willing to
guarantee a minimum purchase volume and reference price through a purchase agreement/contract; and, (iv) having
sufficient purchasing power, appropriate facilities, positive references and experience with small producers.

                    In Practice Box 2: Preparation and Selection Criteria for Subproject
                    Business Plans


Ideally, business plans should be developed jointly between the alliance partners (producer organizations and buyers)
and the service providers contracted as part of the subprojects. To minimize bias and rent-seeking, the service providers
developing the business plans are generally different from the ones supporting the selected business plan subprojects
during implementation.

To ensure good quality, the selection criteria for subprojects across all PA projects are typically based on a mix of:

  i.  Technical feasibility (e.g. production capacity and quality);
  ii.  Financially viability (e.g. financial sustainability beyond the duration of project support);
  iii.  Market linkage strength (e.g. quality of market analysis, identification of technical assistance needs, participation in
  marketing events);
  iv.  Alliance partners’ capacity (e.g. quality of production planning, quality control, identification of production
  bottlenecks);,
  v.  Social aspects (e.g. potential for job creation, belonging to a disadvantaged group); and,
  vi.  Environmental sustainability (e.g. the subproject’s promotion of improved or climate-efficient production practices).

The involvement of local actors in the evaluation and selection of subproject proposals is key to validate the information
provided and to assess the soundness of the proposals against eligibility criteria. However, PA projects vary in the
degree to which decentralized actors are involved in the selection process. As shown in the table, while several projects
have regional PCUs supporting the screening and evaluation of proposals before transmitting their opinion to the
centralized institutions (e.g. PCU, project steering committee, or independent evaluation agency) for final approval, only
the Bolivia PAR, Colombia PAAP and Peru ALIADOS projects used regional multi-stakeholder committees to perform
these tasks.

                           Alliances (Colombia)



      In addition to the Project grant and co-financing from individual producers or the producer organization, Colombia’s
      PAAP I and II projects leveraged funds from different public and private sources, including local government agencies,
      municipalities and other development partners. Hence, while the matching grant provided by the Project was by design
      limited to a maximum of 30% of the total subproject investment costs, the remaining 70% came from various sources,
      including:

        i.  Producer/Producer organizations contributions (usually in-kind: land, equipment and materials)
        ii.  Private sector partner contributions (e.g., technical assistance, packaging materials, seeds)
        iii.  Grants from the contributions of Departmental Secretariats of Agriculture
        iv.  Grants from other institutions such as the National Service for Apprenticeship (SENA) and local governments
        (municipalities)


      While this approach successfully leveraged funds from public and private funding sources other than the Project, it also
      entailed certain risks. For example, the Colombia implementation experience showed that delays in the disbursement
      of these complementary contributions could delay the entire investment. Moreover, public funds for agriculture from
      local sources may be concentrated around a relatively limited number of producers, at the expense of producers in
      other locations. Finally, the producer contributions are usually provided in kind through existing assets (e.g., land, family
      labor) which - if valued at market prices - might inflate their value to meet co-financing requirements, whereas cash
      contributions are provided entirely through the Project grants.

                         In Practice Box 5: Upfront Engagement of the Commercial Financial
                         Sector (Honduras)


     The Honduras COMRURAL project required that a subproject secure a loan from a financial partner, covering at least of
     30% of total subproject investment costs, in addition to the required 10% in cash or in kind contribution by the PO. From
     the beginning of the project, a broad range of financial partners were identified as eligible to participate in co-financing
     the subproject:

       i.  Commercial banks, finance associations, private finance development institutions regulated by the Banking and
       National Insurance Commission;
       ii.  Credit and savings cooperatives affiliated with the Honduran Federation of Credit and Savings Cooperatives; and,
       iii.  Other micro-finance institutions, and other buyers such as input providers.


     During implementation, the Producer Organizations’ contribution was often higher than required, in some cases almost
     50% of subproject costs. A lesson learned from the Honduras COMRURAL Project is that smallholders are able to
     obtain access to commercial finance despite the widely-held view that it is too risky for banks to lend to smallholders.
     The project has demonstrated that financial actors can lend funds to organized smallholders if an effective enabling
     environment exists. This includes: strong communication between counterparts and the banks; the setting up of a
     project guarantee fund; and, a longer-term engagement to build trust and confidence among all actors. As a result
     of their participation in the project, various producer organizations have received further loans. Thus, the project was
     able to demonstrate that smallholder producers can be attractive clients who repay their loans on time. Based on this
     experience, a new PDO-level indicator was introduced for the project’s Additional Financing, measuring the percentage
     of producer organizations without loans in arrears, and at the intermediate results level, the ratio of loans to grants in the
     business plans.

                    In Practice Box 6: Revolving Funds as an Alternative Financing
                    Mechanism (Colombia)


In Colombia, many participating producer organizations experienced difficulty accessing commercial credit under PAAP
I. The design of the second phase project PAAP II therefore included stronger measures to entice financial institutions to
provide credit to beneficiary producers. As an intermediate step, a mandatory revolving fund was established which was
initially financed using funds recovered through the partial repayment scheme of Project grant managed by the producer
organizations. Producer organizations were encouraged to use and manage their revolving fund as a tool to finance
their working and investment capital requirements. A secondary objective of the revolving fund was to allow producer
organizations to build up their credit-worthiness, which was expected to enable them to obtain commercial financial
credit. While access to commercial credit remained low during PAAP II, the revolving funds turned out to be a successful
measure to finance (beneficiary) producer investments, technical assistance and to purchase specialized machinery. By
completion of PAAP II, 399 revolving funds were in operation.

Despite the popularity of the revolving funds, the Colombia PAAP project envisaged several steps to also gradually
improve producer organizations’ (PO) access to commercial finance:

  i.  POs’ financial transactions managed by the trust companies could help them build a track record in the financial system
  ii.  POs should prepare audited financial statements
  iii.  Forward contracts could be established to obtain supplier credit
  iv.  Existing vertical alliances from PAAP I that need capital to expand should be assisted by a specialized person in their
  negotiations with the banking system
  v.  The PCU and OGR should approach financial institutions that offer credit to small enterprises such as banks, micro-
  credit institutions and NGOs

      The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) used data from the Colombia PAAP’s M&E system to assess
     the effectiveness of the project in reaching indigenous people, people of Afro-Caribbean descent) and internally
     displaced populations. The analysis showed that a much higher than expected participation of those groups in the
     productive alliances had occurred, sometimes exceeding the proportion of these groups in the overall population (9.9%
     of indigenous peoples as PAAP beneficiaries compared to 3.4% in the country’s overall population, 8.8% of displaced
     people compared to 7.3% in the population, and 8.5% of Afro-Colombians compared to 10.6% in the population).

     Furthermore, the study also compared the performance of alliances involving these disadvantaged groups to alliances
     involving producers from non-disadvantaged groups (CIAT, 2014). It found that the former performed as well and
     in some cases even better than the latter, demonstrating the suitability of the Productive Alliance approach for
     disadvantaged groups.

                          (Colombia)



      It is critically important to distinguish between the dissolution of a vertical productive alliance between producers and
      buyers, and the failure of a PO. A vertical alliance can be dissolved for many reasons. It might be assumed that the
      reason is the non-viability (failure) of the PO, but this assumption is not supported by evidence from Colombia PAAP
      I. Other possible reasons include: the inability of the PO to produce the agreed volume of product(s) and/or meet the
      agreed quality criteria; the buyer’s inability to meet purchasing commitments; changing market conditions; the buyer’s
      evolving business priorities; or, the failure of the buyer. Data from the Colombia PAAP M&E System show that of the
      51 PAAP I vertical alliances that were dissolved, 50% could be attributed to changes in market conditions and/or the
      business cycle. Moreover, the dissolution rate diminished steadily during the life of the project: the dissolution rate
      averaged 54% from 2002 to 2004 before dropping to 31% from 2005 to 2007, and to 25% by 2007.

      Results of the CIAT impact evaluation underline the fact that the dissolution of a vertical alliance between producers and
      buyers does not necessarily signal the failure of the PO. This study showed that following the dissolution of a productive
      alliance, 70% of the POs entered into a new vertical alliance with a new buyer. Of those, more than 80% did so within six
      months after the dissolution of the initial alliance, and 98% within two years.

was perceived as valuable. Continued
monitoring of Colombia PAAP alliances
even after project closure, showed that
most of the productive alliances had
continued to operate even seven years
after project completion. Specifically,
62% of first phase partnerships were
continuing to operate seven years after
PAAP-I closure. In the case of PAAP-
II vertical alliances, 80% of producer
organizations continued to sell to a buyer
24 months after project support ended
(In Practice Box 8). Furthermore, the
CIAT study demonstrated that the vast
majority of producer organizations were
capable of establishing new alliances
when an earlier alliance dissolved (CIAT,
2014). Regarding other dimensions of
sustainability, the survey results from 83
beneficiary vertical alliances in the impact
evaluation of PAAP II show that 82%
of beneficiary producer organizations
are collecting annual membership
fees to finance their operations and to
maintain capital infrastructure. Another
factor influencing the sustainability of
production is productive reinvestments,
with PAAP II beneficiary producers
being more likely to reinvest part
of their net revenues in productive
activities than the control group.

                     In Practice Box 9: Factors of Sustainability (Bolivia and Colombia)



The following findings regarding the factors influencing the sustainability of productive vertical alliances between
producers and buyers were documented in Implementation Completion Reports:

Bolivia PAR I: Alliance sustainability depends on: (i) production viability at the level of the producers themselves; (ii)
continuation of PO services to members; and, (iii) sustained relations with market agents. Close to 94% of POs had
an IRR exceeding 12.5% at closing, showing that most of the producers are currently engaged in financially viable
initiatives. Anecdotal evidence indicates that this is more likely in the cases where the organization itself assumes a role
in the production cycle (e.g. input purchases, technical assistance, post-production processing and sales). Results from
the beneficiary survey indicate that alliances which reconcile the main interests of producers (higher income) and buyers
(product quality) are likely to be sustainable. Both these conditions are dominant in the project outcomes. About 33% of
the POs changed their buyer between alliance identification and completion, and preliminary results from the beneficiary
survey indicate that about 25% had quit a formal arrangement with a buyer.

Colombia PAAP I: The “age of the alliances matters, as profitability matures over time. However, even if an alliance
fails, the impact on production, income and marketing may still be significant: producer organizations will have gained
experience in dealing with buyers and should be able to identify and negotiate with other buyers” (ICR Colombia
PAAP II). One major conclusion from the beneficiary survey is that the sustainability of the alliance depends largely on
the operation of the POs; beneficiary producers perceived that positive results flow from well-organized operations,
teamwork and financing.

     During the Mid-Term Review, the Brazil Pernambuco Task Team revised the definition of a PDO indicator measuring
     successful productive alliances. As the original description of what was meant by “successful” was unclear, the Team
     selected six key criteria that it considered indispensable for a successfully functioning productive alliance. Although
     developed for one specific project, these criteria could be applied to other PA project Results Frameworks, as they refer,
     among others, to: (i) the sustainable operation of project-supported productive investments; (ii) their maintenance; (iii)
     the producer organization’s accounting capacity; and, (iv) diversification of buyers.

     Furthermore, the revised indicator targets took into account that realistically, not all beneficiary producer organizations
     would comply with all six criteria at project completion. The concept of “successful” in this context was based on
     compliance of 60% (i.e. 4 out of 6) of the criteria listed. The revised PDO indicator for a successful productive alliance, its
     related targets and descriptions are displayed below.

     The partnership between the World Bank Agriculture Global and the Development Impact Evaluation Unit (DIME)
     includes several projects in Brazil and Haiti. The evaluations seek to identify the observed changes to the outcome
     indicators and quantify how much can be attributed to the PA project interventions. DIME works closely with the projects
     to ensure that a suitable control group is identified and that data is collected at baseline and end-line.

     Most evaluations look at the overall PA approach to see if providing a package of matching grants for productive
     investments, technical assistance, business development training, and the identification of business opportunities can
     relax the constraints on smallholder producers in terms of technology adoption and innovation, productivity growth and
     access to markets. In the case of Brazil Ceará, it will also be possible to assess the relative importance of the different
     barriers. By assigning the eligible producer organizations to receive either managerial training or financial support plus
     business plan development, the evaluation team will be able to disentangle the impact of the different components. In
     Haiti, it will look at the additive impact of a business skills program for women within the organizations.

     Besides generating knowledge on the impact of the PA projects, direct engagements with the government counterparts
     seek to strengthen their capacity to implement evidence-based policymaking using a learning-by-doing approach and
     training events.

                     Methodologies



The evaluation work of DIME assessing the impact of Productive Alliance projects can be divided into two phases. The
first phase used non-experimental evaluation methods to identify the impact in Brazil São Paulo and Santa Catarina
as well as Haiti. At that time, a plausible empirical strategy seemed to be to compare producer organizations whose
business plans ranked just below and just above the threshold for being selected for support (using the method of
Regression Discontinuity Design, or RDD). Although RDD is seen as the non-experimental that most resembles a
randomized controlled trial, it has limitations. First, it requires a large number of observations around the threshold.
Second, when successfully implemented, it informs the impact of the program only for the organizations close to
the threshold.

After the data collection, it turned out that in all projects the initial take-up was relatively low and the score distribution
was very heterogeneous. This resulted in a small number of producer organizations around the threshold and lack of
statistical power to evaluate the projects using the original design. As a result, the evaluation team decided to use
Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to select a group of control organizations that at baseline most resembled the selected
organizations. The credibility of PSM relies on the availability of lots of baseline characteristics of both beneficiaries and
a large group of non-beneficiaries, which is often not available. With these experiences in mind, the second phase of
evaluations have been set up with the experimental evaluation method of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) instead.
RCT ensure credible estimates of program impact, requiring far fewer assumptions and small samples compared to non-
experimental methods. The projects for which the RCT method is used are in the Brazilian Northeastern States of Ceará
and Bahia (see table below).

First results of these evaluations are expected in early 2017. To the extent known, they will be based on one of the
few experimental evaluations of matching grant programs in agriculture like the PA approach. Hence, the findings are
expected to contribute to filling a large gap of evidence in this field.

16.	Business Development Service providers were responsible for holistic technical assistance, which included pre-investment costs of business
    plan preparation as well as management, negotiation and quality assurance costs of partnerships (capacity building and knowledge transfer
    on productive system, good agriculture practices and good manufacturing practices, administrative and entrepreneurial management, legal
    services, marketing services, certification services, supervision activities). The maximum acceptable cost of Business Development Services
    (including the cost of preparing the business plan and management expenses, negotiation and quality assurance) was US$40,000, of which
    PDER financed up to 90% and PO at least 10%.
17.	In the initial implementation phase of ALIADOS, financing of goods was limited to US$4,200 per subproject, irrespective of its size. As a
    consequence, producers requested the smallest subproject that would allow maximizing this financing, which resulted in a portfolio of smaller
    subprojects than anticipated at appraisal. As a result, the Additional Financing incentivizes larger business by increasing the value of the capital
    goods eligible for financing to 70%. The AF introduces additional support for about 15% of the most successful Business Plans financed under
    the original project, for both TA and co-financing (up to the financing ceiling).

Project                 Monitoring Activities and Data Collection
                         During implementation: Technical Assistance (TA) providers of the alliance collect and systematize
                         technical, economic, social, environmental and administrative data for each alliance, which is then
                         reported and recorded in the project’s M&E System. 
                         At subproject completion: The TA prepares an ex-post financial assessment, which is based on the
Bolivia PAR I & II
                         structure of the business plan and includes revenue and cost “with and without PAR”. For PAR I, con-
                         solidated business information was presented to POs in participatory workshops for their validation. A
                         final report or closing memory is recorded.
                         Project M&E: Online Geo-referenced Management Information System
                         During implementation: The planned M&E System was never established. As a result, only partial
                         monitoring of subprojects was carried out by the PCU.
                         At subproject completion: Due to the lack of sufficient or representative data and quantitative infor-
Brazil Alto Solimôes     mation, an ex-post assessment during the ICR mission collected its own data during field visits directly
                         from beneficiary communities and relied on partial studies and progress reports for some subproject
                         activities.
                         Project M&E: Excel sheets and Word documents (State-level PCU)
                         During implementation: The planned M&E System was integrated in the central State-level Secretari-
                         at of Agriculture’s online Monitoring Information System (MIS). As a result, subproject-level information
                         is captured by the PCU with data received from the regional offices. The Mid-Term Review revealed,
                         however, that some information of the subproject selection process is not recorded in the MIS, while
Brazil Pernambuco        other data records are very detailed and require time-consuming data entry.
                         At subproject completion: The PCU is responsible for an ex-post financial assessment of subproject
                         performance. At Mid-Term Review, it was agreed that a complementary PO-level evaluation would be
                         implemented.
                         Project M&E: Online Monitoring Information System

                         At subproject completion: At completion, only a disbursement monitoring system was in place. A

                         plified compared to the original design to capture information on subproject results.
                         Project M&E: Excel sheets and Word documents (Non-aggregated data was captured only partially at
                         the State Secretariat of Environment and the Pará Land Institute)
                         During implementation: The Monitoring Information System established in a former project was
                         upgraded and linked to the financial management system (TOTVS/Microsiga PROTEUS) during project
                         implementation. The MIS was fully self-financed by the State (not by the Project). However, despite it
                         being a well-managed, modern instrument, it remained a database on the subproject cycle, physical

* This figure refers to IDA/IBRD financing related to productive alliance investments (as in case of Brazil, complementary investments
in other sectors were done). It excludes counterpart funds. It includes the matching grant as well as the costs for technical assistance,
but excludes costs for business plan preparation (except for Guatemala).
** Due to lack of data, this figure represents the total direct investment in subprojects and/or micro-projects (not only IBRD). For
Brazil Pará, the figure includes US$1.44 m spent on matching grants for subprojects.
*** The investment per beneficiary figures are based on provided data on household figures and assume four members per house-
hold due to lack of detailed data provision. Similarly, the investments per subproject are based on the total amount of financing and
total number of alliances stated, being a simple average not reflecting the heterogeneity across subprojects.

18.	These figures are the total number of vertical alliances/subprojects established during project implementation that were still operating at
    project completion. For example, in Colombia 744 had been established with 46,362 direct beneficiaries, but 725 were still operating at project
    completion. Similarly, in Guatemala, a total of 216 alliances had been established(189 Business Plans and 27 Business Strengthening Plans), but
    15 BP were cancelled during project, resulting in a total 174 alliances funded
19.	The PAD was inconsistent in defining the number of target beneficiary households in its Results Framework, referring to 36,000 as well as 25,000
    households. The PDO indicator referred to 36,000 households.
20.	The Brazil Sergipe project implemented “socio-economic infrastructure” subprojects, which included productive market- linked investments
    with technical assistance support, next to other types of subprojects. 1000 (restructured to 500) of these socio-economic subprojects for 20,000
    households were the appraisal targets. At completion, 547 subprojects had been implemented in total, benefiting 22,006 households. For this
    assessment only results for productive subprojects are reported.
21.	The original target of 60 alliance subprojects was based on a US$500,000 ceiling per subproject. This ceiling was reduced to US$ 250,000 in
    2012, which automatically doubled the possible number of alliances, resulting in an actual financing of 130 alliances.
22.	The Brazil Alto Solimôes project was implemented with producers through community associations. Hence, no information on producer
    organization membership can be provided, but instead the average number of beneficiary households per subproject.

Abstract: This paper builds on global experience and Zambia‚Äôs specific context to identify an
effective nutrition approach along with costs and benefits of key nutrition interventions. It is
intended to help guide the selection of the most cost-effective interventions as well as strategies
for scaling these up. The paper considers both relevant ‚Äúnutrition-specific‚Äù interventions, largely
delivered through the health sector, and multisectoral ‚Äúnutrition-sensitive‚Äù interventions, delivered
through other sectors such as agriculture, education, and water and sanitation. We estimate that
the costs and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions would require an annual
public investment of $40.5 million and would avert over 112,000 DALYs, save over 2,800 lives,
and prevent 62,000 cases of stunting. Economic productivity could potentially increase by $915
million annually over the productive lives of the beneficiaries, with an impressive internal rate of
return of 32 percent. However, because it is unlikely that the Government of the Zambia or its
partners will find the $40.5 million necessary each year to reach full coverage, we also consider
scale-up scenarios based on considerations of their potential for impact, burden of stunting,
resource requirements, and implementation capacity. The two scenarios that scale up the nine
most cost-effective nutrition-specific interventions (excluding the public provision of
complementary foods) are the most advantageous in terms of cost-effectiveness and resource
requirements and would require $11 million to scale up to partial levels and $23 to scale up to full-
coverage levels. Among the 8 nutrition-specific interventions we consider, school-based
deworming is low cost and effective. The interventions we reviewed in the agriculture sector are
expensive when compared to nutrition-specific interventions, although very little cost-
effectiveness data are available for the nutrition-sensitive interventions to make careful
comparisons. These findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and a
candidate list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a highly cost-effective approach to
reducing child malnutrition in Zambia.

Keywords: nutrition-specific interventions, nutrition-sensitive interventions, cost-effectiveness of
nutrition interventions, Zambia, nutrition financing.

Aflatoxins are a group of toxic compounds produced by certain molds, especially Aspergillus
flavus, which contaminate stored food supplies such as animal feed, maize, and peanuts.
Research shows that human consumption of high levels of aflatoxins can lead to liver cirrhosis
(Kuniholm et al. 2008) and liver cancer in adults (Abt Associates 2014). It is widely understood
that there is a relationship between aflatoxin exposure and child stunting, but this relationship has
not yet been adequately quantified in the published literature (Unnevehr and Grace 2013; Abt
Associates 2014).

A benefit-cost ratio summarizes the overall value of a project or proposal. It is the ratio of the
benefits of a project or proposal, expressed in monetary terms, relative to its costs, also expressed
in monetary terms. The benefit-cost ratio takes into account the amount of monetary gain realized
by implementing a project versus the amount it costs to execute the project. The higher the ratio,
the better the investment. A general rule is that if the benefit from a project is greater than its cost,
the project is a good investment.

Biocontrol (also called biological control) is the use of an invasive agent to reduce pest or mold
population below a desired level. Aflatoxins can be reduced through biocontrol; the most effective
method involves a single application of a product (such as aflasafe‚Ñ¢) that contains strains unique
to the specific country or location.

Biofortification is the breeding of crops to increase their nutritional value. This can be done either
through conventional selective breeding or through genetic engineering.

Capacity development for program delivery is a process that involves increasing in-country
human capacity and systems to design, deliver, manage, and evaluate large-scale interventions
(World Bank 2010). This includes developing skills by training public health personnel and
community volunteers to improve the delivery of services. These efforts typically accompany
program implementation or, when possible, precede program implementation. In this costing
analysis we allocate 9 percent of total programmatic costs to capacity development for program
delivery.

Cost-benefit analysis is an approach to economic analysis that weighs the cost of an
intervention against its benefits. The approach involves assigning a monetary value to the benefits
of an intervention and estimating the expected present value of the net benefits, known as the net
present value. Net benefits are the difference between the cost and monetary value of benefits of
the intervention. The net present value is defined mathematically as:
                                                                     Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á
                                                                                 Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°
         Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±Å Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ù Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£ = ÔøΩ                  ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂0
                                                                              (1 + Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü)Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°
                                                                  Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°=1

where Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° is net cash inflows, Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂0 is the initial investment, the index Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° is the time period, and Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü is the
discount rate. A positive net present value, when discounted at appropriate rates, indicates that
the present value of cash inflows (benefits) exceeds the present value of cash outflows (cost of
financing). Interventions with net present values that are at least as high as alternative
interventions provide greater benefits than interventions with net present values equal to or lower



                                                                                                       ix
than alternatives. The results of cost-benefit analysis can also be expressed in terms of the
benefit-cost ratio.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is an approach to economic analysis that is intended to identify
interventions that produce the desired results at the lowest cost. Cost-effectiveness analysis
requires two components: the total cost of the intervention and an estimate of the intervention‚Äôs
impact, such as the number of lives saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio can be defined as:

                                                                                                                Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ú Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ

The analysis involves comparing the cost-effectiveness ratios among alternative interventions
with the same outcomes. The intervention with the lowest cost per benefit is considered to be the
most cost-effective intervention among the alternatives.

A DALY is a disability-adjusted life year, which is equivalent to a year of healthy life lost due to
a health condition. The DALY, developed in 1993 by the World Bank, combines the years of life
lost from a disease (YLL) and the years of life spent with disability from the disease (YLD). DALYs
count the gains from both mortality (how many more years of life lost due to premature death are
prevented) and morbidity (how many years or parts of years of life lost due to disability are
prevented). An advantage of the DALY is that it is a metric that is recognized and understood by
external audiences such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of
Health (NIH). It helps to gauge the contribution of individual diseases relative to the overall burden
of disease by geographic region or health area. Combined with cost data, DALYs allow for
estimating and comparing the cost-effectiveness of scaling up nutrition interventions in different
countries.

A discount rate refers to a rate of interest used to determine the current value of future cash
flows. The concept of the time value of money suggests that income earned in the present is
worth more than the same amount of income earned in the future because of its earning potential.
A higher discount rate reflects higher losses to potential benefits from alternative investments in
capital. A higher discount rate may also reflect a greater risk premium of the intervention.

The internal rate of return is the discount rate that produces a net present value of cash flows
equal to zero. An intervention has a non-negative net present value when the internal rate of
return equals or exceeds the appropriate discount rate. Interventions yielding higher internal rates
of return than alternatives tend to be considered more desirable than the alternatives.

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is an estimation tool that translates measured coverage changes
into estimates of mortality reduction and cases of childhood stunting averted. LiST is used to
project how increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal survival. It is part
of an integrated set of tools that comprise the Spectrum policy modeling system.

Monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical support for program
delivery are all elements of cost-effective and efficient program implementation. Monitoring
involves checking progress against plans through the systematic and routine collection of
information from projects and programs in order to learn from experience to improve practices
and activities in the future, to ensure internal and external accountability of the resources used
and the results obtained, and to make informed decisions on the future of the intervention.

Operations research aims to inform the program designers about ways to deliver interventions
more effectively and efficiently. Technical support entails ensuring that training, support, and
maintenance for the physical elements of the intervention are available. In this costing exercise,
we allocate 2 percent of total intervention costs for monitoring and evaluation, operations
research, and technical support.

Nutrition-sensitive interventions are those that have an indirect impact on nutrition and are
delivered through sectors other than health such as the agriculture, education, and water,
sanitation, and hygiene sectors. Examples include biofortification of food crops, conditional cash
transfers, and water and sanitation infrastructure improvements.

Nutrition-specific interventions are those that address the immediate determinants of child
nutrition, such as adequate food and nutrition intake, feeding and caregiving practices, and
treating disease. Examples include community nutrition programs, micronutrient
supplementation, and deworming.

Sensitivity analysis is a technique that evaluates the robustness of findings when key variables
change. It helps to identify the variables with the greatest and least influence on the outcomes of
the intervention, and it may involve adjusting the values of a variable to observe the impact of the
variable on the outcome.

Stunting is an anthropometric measure of low height-for-age. It is an indicator of chronic
undernutrition and is the result of prolonged food deprivation and/or disease or illness. It is
measured in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below); a child is
considered stunted with a height-for-age Z-score of ‚àí2 or lower.

Underweight is an anthropometric measure of low weight-for-age. It is used as a composite
indicator to reflect both acute and chronic undernutrition, although it cannot distinguish between
them. It is measured in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below); a
child is considered underweight with a weight-for-age Z-score of ‚àí2 or lower.

Wasting is an anthropometric indicator of low weight-for-height. It is an indicator of acute
undernutrition and the result of more recent food deprivation or illness. It is measured in terms of
Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below). A child with a weight-for-height Z-
score of ‚àí2 or lower is considered wasted.


A Z-score or standard deviation score is a calculation used to explain deviations from an
established norm. It is calculated with the following formula:

                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The overall objective of this paper is to provide technical assistance to the Government of Zambia
in the implementation of its nutrition policy and programs. It provides the Government of Zambia
with the tools needed to leverage adequate resources from domestic budgets, as well as from
development partners in support of implementing the nutrition scale-up plan. The executive
summary highlights the main findings and discusses the implications for nutrition policy in Zambia.
The remainder of the report is more technical in nature and is written for a broader audience,
including planners and programmers. The analysis is expected to bring to bear evidence of
potential for impact and allocative efficiency into Zambia‚Äôs nutrition programming.

The prevalence of chronic undernutrition, as measured by stunting in children under five, was 40
percent in 2013‚Äì14 and, although this represents a decline from 53 percent in 2001‚Äì02, it
nevertheless represents a heavy burden of undernutrition in Zambia. Micronutrient deficiencies
(hidden hunger) are also prevalent, with vitamin A deficiency and anemia rates particularly high.
There is geographical disparity in stunting rates in the country; the highest rates are in the
Northern region (almost 50 percent), followed by Muchinga, Eastern, Luapula, and Central
provinces, which all had stunting rates above 40 percent in 2013‚Äì14.

Malnutrition, particularly in very young children, leads to increased mortality, increased illness,
and longer-term adverse effects on cognitive abilities and schooling outcomes, thereby producing
irreversible losses to human capital that contribute to later losses in economic productivity.
Undernutrition is responsible for about one-half of under-five child mortality and one-fifth of
maternal mortality in developing countries. In the longer term, stunting results in a 10 to 17 percent
in loss in wages. Furthermore, Zambia loses over $186 million in GDP annually to vitamin and
mineral deficiencies alone (World Bank 2013).

At the same time, nutrition interventions are consistently identified as among the most cost-
effective development actions and the costs of scaling up nutrition interventions are modest. Cost-
benefit analysis shows that nutrition interventions are highly effective (World Bank 2010, 2012;
Hoddinott et al. 2013). It is estimated that investing in nutrition can increase a country‚Äôs gross
domestic product (GDP) by at least 3 percent annually (Horton and Steckel 2013). The global
cost to scaling up key nutrition interventions is estimated at $10.3 billion per annum (World Bank
2010). These investments would provide preventive nutrition services to about 356 million
children, save at least 1.1 million lives, avert 30 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and
reduce the number of stunted children by about 30 million worldwide.

The paper identifies costs and benefits of key nutrition programs in Zambia and is intended to
help guide the prioritization of the most cost-effective interventions. The report uses the costing
framework established by Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost? (World Bank 2010) and applies
it to the specific context of Zambia. Combining costing with estimates of impact (in terms of lives
saved, DALYs averted, and cases of stunting averted) and cost-effectiveness analysis, the results
will aid in priority setting by identifying the most cost-effective packages of interventions in
situations where financial and human resources are constrained.

The costs presented in the preceding analysis assume scale-up to full coverage in one year.
However, recognizing that a slower, incremental scale-up may be more feasible, we also estimate
the cost for scaling up selected scenarios over a five-year scale-up time frame: to achieve the ‚Äúfull
coverage‚Äù scenario would require an estimated $134.5 million, Scenario 2 would require $70.8
million, and Scenario 4b $34.7 million over five years.

These investments in nutrition could also yield tremendous economic benefits for Zambia. The
full scale-up investment of $40.5 million also has the potential to increase economic productivity
over the productive lives of the beneficiaries by $915 million annually and yield an impressive rate
of return on the investment of 32 percent. The investment would also yield large net present
values of between $4.4 and $13.8 billion depending on the discount rate assumed.

We have identified an annual financing gap for nutrition-specific interventions of at least $11.2
million on top of the current expenditures on nutrition in Zambia. Only $1.5 million of the $15.6
million current annual expenditures on nutrition came from the domestic government budget and
the rest from international donors (see Table 18 in the main report). Donor pledges for 2014‚Äì16
are estimated at more than $36 million for the three-year period. This represents a dramatic
increase and will go a long way toward financing the needed interventions. Nevertheless, it will
not cover both the current expenditures (about $16 million per year) and the additional resources
needed for the most modest scenario (4b) of $11.2 million per year. It will therefore be essential
to leverage additional government resources for nutrition interventions, rather than to continue to
rely exclusively on donors.

The analysis presented here takes an innovative approach by estimating the costs and benefits
not only of nutrition-specific interventions but also of selected nutrition-sensitive interventions
implemented outside of the health sector. While recognizing that the evidence base for the impact
of nutrition-sensitive interventions is less conclusive, we considered seven nutrition-sensitive
interventions in the agriculture and education sectors that have shown some potential for
improving nutrition outcomes. These include four interventions in the agriculture sector:
biofortification of vitamin A-rich maize and sweet potato, aflatoxin control in maize, and the
promotion of diet diversity. Four interventions in the education sector are also considered: school-
based based deworming, school-based promotion of good hygiene, school-based treatment of
bilharzias, and school-based feeding. The estimated annual costs are $58 million for scaling up
all four of the agricultural interventions and $22 million for the four in the education sector.
However, these must be considered rough approximations, because there are significant
limitations in both the available data and in the methodological approaches. In addition, we were
not able to estimate the benefits of these interventions because of data and methodological
shortcomings, although we do report benefits calculated by researchers for other countries.
Nevertheless, this preliminary costing analysis suggests that the nutrition-sensitive interventions
considered here‚Äîwith the exception of school-based deworming‚Äîare significantly more costly
than the nutrition-specific interventions.

In summary, these findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and a
candidate list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a highly cost-effective approach to
reducing the high levels of child malnutrition in Zambia.

                                         COUNTRY CONTEXT

Zambia is a landlocked southern African country with a vibrant economy primarily dependent on
mining and agriculture. 1 The county‚Äôs estimated 14.1 million inhabitants live in an area of 752,618
square kilometers, which is subdivided into 10 provinces and 89 districts (Figure 1). The climate
is generally tropical with some modifications by elevation. The Zambian economy has been
historically dependent on the copper industry, although agriculture now provides more jobs. Since
2003 the economy has been growing at over 5 percent per year; its growth rate was over 7 percent
in 2012. Despite having one of the higher per capita GNI in the region‚Äîof $1,540 in 2013 (World
Bank 2014)‚ÄîZambia has a poverty rate of over 60 percent (World Bank 2012b). Further, Zambia
ranks low at 164 out of 187 countries on the Human Development Index (UNDP 2012).

                                 NUTRITIONAL STATUS IN ZAMBIA

Overall health status in Zambia has been steadily improving in recent years. Life expectancy rose
dramatically, from 42 years in 2000 to 57 years in 2012 (World Bank 2014). Under-five child
mortality declined from 143 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 89 in 2012. Infant mortality rates also
declined from 86 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 56 in 2012 (World Bank 2014). Zambia‚Äôs rate of
improvement compares favorably with that of other Africa countries, as shown in Figure 2.
Between 2005 and 2010, under-five mortality rates in Zambia declined by more than 5 percent.

The prevalence of chronic malnutrition, as measured by stunting in children under five years of
age, remains very high: this was 40 percent in 2013‚Äì14. This represents a decline since the recent
high of 53 percent of children under five stunted in 2001‚Äì02 (Figure 3). Stunting is a measure of
chronic undernutrition and reflects long-term poor caloric intake and poor quality of nutrition,
including micronutrient deficiencies. Rates of wasting (acute undernutrition) are much lower, at 5
to 6 percent, and have remained unchanged since the early 1990s. Taken together, these findings
suggest that children are not suffering from short-term or seasonal food shortages as much as
they are from relying on a poor diet that lacks sufficient nutrients for healthy growth over the long
run. On a positive note, the share of children who are underweight has declined from 23 percent
in 2001‚Äì02 to 15 percent in 2013‚Äì14.

There is regional variation in malnutrition as well an association between malnutrition, as
measured by stunting, and poverty rates (Figure 4). In addition, Figure 4 shows the change in the
geography of both stunting and poverty between 2007 and 2013‚Äì14. Although provinces in the
northeast and central area (Luapula, Northern, Eastern, and Central provinces) all had stunting
rates at or above 50 percent in 2007, these rates have all come down to the mid and low 40s.
This compares with lower rates in Lusaka, Southern, and Western provinces. Poverty rates were
highest in the Northern province in 2007 but declined there in 2010, while increasing in the south
and western provinces. Overall there was a slight increase in the poverty rate nationally, with 60
percent of Zambians living in poverty in 2010 as compared to 57 percent in 2007.

Rates of childhood stunting also vary with income, although poverty is not the only explanation
for undernutrition in Zambia. Stunting rates in the bottom three quartiles are higher than 40
percent, while these rates are 28 percent in the richest quartile (Figure 5). Nevertheless, it is
noteworthy that over one-quarter of children in the richest are stunted. This shows that while
poverty is associated with stunting, other factors are also at play. Non-food factors, such as

disease, optimal feeding and caregiving practices have a major role to play in causing
malnutrition.

Vitamin and mineral deficiencies (hidden hunger) are also pervasive in Zambia. As shown in
Figure 6, over 54 percent of children under five and 13 percent of pregnant women in Zambia
were deficient in vitamin A during 1993‚Äì2003, the most recent time period for which data are
available (World Bank 2011). Vitamin A deficiency increases child mortality, increases
vulnerability to infectious diseases such as measles, and can lead to blindness among children
under five years old (Mayo-Wilson et al. 2011). Based on the 2013‚Äì14 Demographic and Health
Survey (DHS), 77 percent of children aged 6‚Äì59 months received vitamin A supplementation in
the previous 6 months, up from 60 percent in 2007. In addition, the data from 1993‚Äì2003 show
that about half of young children and pregnant women in Zambia were anemic. Although data on
current levels of anemia are not available, the 2103‚Äì14 DHS reported that about half of children
aged 6‚Äì23 months consumed iron-rich foods in the previous 24-hour period. The share of
households that consumed iodized salt in 2013‚Äì14 was 96 percent (DHS 2013‚Äì14). Overall, it is
estimated that Zambia loses $186 million annually to vitamin and mineral deficiencies (World
Bank 2011).

Another health burden in Zambia is the high levels of aflatoxins, which are naturally occurring
carcinogenic byproducts of common fungi on crops such as maize and groundnuts. Although
there are no prevalence data for Zambia, experts consider aflatoxin contamination to be
extensive. Evidence from other countries shows that high aflatoxin consumption can lead to liver
cirrhosis (Kuniholm et al. 2008) and liver cancer in adults (Abt Associates 2014). Further, it is
widely understood that there is a relationship between aflatoxin exposure and child stunting,
although the evidence base for this relationship is still tentative and it has not yet been adequately
quantified in the published literature (Unnevehr and Grace 2013; Abt Associates 2014).

Approximately 12,700 children under five die each year in Zambia from diarrhea. Over half of
these deaths are directly attributed to poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WHO 2009). Diarrheal
episodes exacerbate the relationship between malnutrition and infection because children tend to
eat less, absorb fewer nutrients, and exhibit reduced resistance to infections. Prolonged diarrheal
episodes lead to impaired growth and development (Ejemot et al. 2008). Poor sanitation is also a
contributing factor‚Äîthrough its impact on malnutrition rates‚Äîto other leading causes of child
mortality including malaria, acute respiratory infections, and measles.

Parasitic intestinal worms are considered to be widely prevalent in Zambia, although no national-
level prevalence data are available. A summary of all survey data of helminth infections in Zambia
from 1983 through 2007 shows a wide range of infection rates, with the majority having a
prevalence of over 20 percent, as depicted in the red-colored areas in Figure 7 (Global Atlas of
Helminth Infections 2014). One recent study of the Kafue District in the Lusaka Province found a
soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection rate of 18 percent among preschool children (Siwila et
al. 2010). The high rates of anemia among children in Zambia also point to a significant problem
with STH. In the short term, helminthic infections potentially cause anemia and increase morbidity,
undernutrition, and impairment of mental and physical development (Hotez et al. 2008). In the
long term, infected children are estimated to have an average IQ loss of 3.75 points per child and
they earn less as adults (43 percent) than those who grow up free of worms (Bleakley 2007).

                          THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN NUTRITION

Undernutrition is an underlying cause of approximately half the deaths in children under five and
one-fifth of maternal deaths in developing countries. The joint effect of suboptimum breastfeeding
and fetal growth restriction in the neonatal period alone contributes 1.3 million deaths or 19
percent of all deaths of children under five (Black et al. 2013). Undernourished children are more
likely to die from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhea, measles, pneumonia, malaria, or
HIV/AIDS.

Those malnourished children who survive face long-lasting health and schooling consequences,
including cognitive deficits and poorer schooling outcomes. Children with impaired cognitive skills
have lower school enrollment, attendance, and graduation, which in turn results in lower
productivity, earnings, and economic well-being. Stunted children lose 0.7 grades of schooling
and are more likely to drop out of school. An adequate intake of micronutrients‚Äîparticularly iron,
vitamin A, iodine, and zinc‚Äîis critical for growth and cognitive development. Iodine-deficient
children lose on average 13 IQ points, and iron deficiency anemia reduces performance on tests
by 8 IQ points, making these children less educable and less productive in the long run (World
Bank 2006). Behrman et al. (2009) showed improved schooling and test scores from food
supplementation in early childhood.

Malnutrition costs developing countries billions of dollars in lost revenue through reduced
economic productivity, particularly through lower wages, lower physical capability, and more days
away from work as a result of illness. At the individual level, childhood stunting is estimated to
reduce a person‚Äôs potential lifetime earnings by at least 10 percent (World Bank 2006). Other
studies have shown that a 1 percent loss in adult height results in a 2 to 2.4 percent loss in
productivity (Strauss and Thomas 1998; Caulfield et al. 2004). In addition, micronutrient
deficiencies in childhood and adulthood have tremendous economic cost for both individuals and
countries. Childhood anemia alone is associated with a 2.5 percent drop in adult wages. Anemia
in adults has been estimated to be equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP; this estimate goes up to 3.4
percent when including the secondary effects of retarded cognitive development in children
(Horton 1999). Horton and Ross (2003) estimate that eliminating iron-deficiency anemia would

                                                  21
result in a 5 to 17 percent increase in adult productivity. Annually Zambia loses over $186 million
in GDP to vitamin and mineral deficiencies alone (World Bank 2013). The economic costs of
undernutrition have the greatest effect on the most vulnerable in the developing world. A recent
analysis estimates these losses at 11 percent of GDP in Africa and Asia each year (Horton and
Steckel 2013)‚Äîequivalent to about $149 billion of productivity losses.

Because most of the detrimental effects of malnutrition occur in the first 1,000 days of a child‚Äôs
life, , the window of opportunity for preventing these effects is the before the child is two years of
age. After that age, most actions are too little, too late, and too expensive (World Bank 2006;
Black et al. 2008, 2013). Figure 8 shows that the rates of return from human capital (including
nutrition) investments are highest for programs targeting the earliest years, since these
investments build a foundation for future learning and productivity, prevent irreversible losses,
and lock in human capital for life (Heckman and Masterov 2004).

       Note: Age refers to the child‚Äôs age from birth, depicted in years for infancy and preschool, then in
       aggregate for school age and adulthood.

Malnutrition and poverty are interrelated and exacerbate each other. A recent study (Hoddinott et
al. 2011) concluded that individuals who are not stunted at 36 months are one-third less likely to
live in poor households as adults. Poverty increases the risk of malnutrition by lowering poor
households‚Äô purchasing power, reducing access to basic health services, and exposing these
households to unhealthy environments, thereby compromising food intakes (both quality and
quantity) and increasing infections. Poor households are also more likely to have frequent
pregnancies, larger family sizes with high dependency ratios, more infections, and increased
health care costs. Conversely, malnutrition causes poor health status, poor cognitive

                                                   22
development, and less schooling, resulting in in poor human capital and long-term productivity
losses.

Nutrition interventions are consistently identified as cost-effective development actions, and the
costs of scaling up nutrition interventions are modest. Global benefit-cost ratio of micronutrient
powders for children is 37 to 1; of deworming it is 6 to 1; of iron fortification of staples it is 8 to 1;
and of salt iodization is 30 to 1 (World Bank 2010).

A recent World Bank study estimated that investing in nutrition can increase a country‚Äôs GDP by
at least 3 percent annually (World Bank 2010). The same study estimated these costs at $10.3
billion per annum globally, to be financed through domestic public and private sector and donor
resources. These investments would provide preventive nutrition services to about 356 million
children, save at least 1.1 million lives and 30 million DALYs, and reduce the number of stunted
children by about 30 million worldwide. Bhutta et al. (2013) came up with similar estimates. In
another study, Hoddinott, Rosegrant, and Torero (2012) estimate that, for just $100 per child,
interventions including micronutrient provision, public provision of complementary food for the
prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, treatments for worms and diarrheal diseases, and
behavior change programs could reduce chronic undernutrition by 36 percent in developing
countries. Clearly there is huge potential pay-off for dedicating more resources to the scale-up of
evidence-based, cost-effective nutrition interventions.

The     determinants       of   malnutrition   are      the immediate determinants of child nutrition,
multisectoral. Therefore, to successfully and           such as adequate food and nutrition intake,
sustainably improve nutrition outcomes, a               feeding and caregiving practices, and treating
multisectoral approach is needed. At a proximate        disease. Examples include:

determinants of malnutrition can be further             Nutrition-sensitive     interventions     are
enhanced by action on some of the more distal           delivered through the agriculture; education;
levels. For example, programs supporting                and water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors
improved infant and young child feeding                 and have the potential to have an impact on
practices will be more effective if they are            nutrition outcomes more indirectly than
complemented with programs to address gender            nutrition-specific interventions. Examples

allowing women more time for child care.

                                                   23
Although the health care sector is key in delivering nutrition-specific interventions to the poor
(such as vitamin A supplementation and deworming), multisectoral nutrition-sensitive actions
through the agriculture sector and social protection, water and sanitation, and poverty reduction
programs have the potential to strengthen nutritional outcomes in several ways (Box 2). Examples
of these include (1) improving the context in which the nutrition-specific interventions are
delivered‚Äîfor example, through investment in food systems, empowerment of women, and
equitable education; (2) integrating nutrition considerations into programs in other sectors as
delivery platforms (such as conditional cash transfer programs) that will potentially increase the
scale and coverage of nutrition-specific interventions; and (3) by increasing policy coherence
through government-wide attention to policies or strategies and trade-offs, which may have
positive or unintended negative consequences for nutrition. The synergy with other sectors is
critical to breaking the cycle of malnutrition and sustaining the gains from direct nutrition-specific
interventions (World Bank 2013).

Guidance on costing for nutrition-sensitive interventions is currently very limited for at least two
reasons. First, evidence of the effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive interventions with respect to
nutritional outcomes is limited. Second, compared with nutrition-specific interventions, estimating
and attributing the costs of nutrition-sensitive interventions is quite complex since these
interventions have multiple objectives and improved nutrition outcomes is only one of them.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the availability of costing information is crucial to assess the
cost-effectiveness of these interventions. This series of papers on nutrition interventions makes
a first-ever attempt to address these issues.

We identify and cost seven selected nutrition-sensitive interventions that are relevant for scale-
up in the Zambian context, for which there is evidence of the positive impact on nutrition
outcomes, and for which there is some cost information. These include three interventions
delivered through the agriculture sector‚Äîvitamin A biofortification of orange maize and sweet
potato, aflatoxin reduction through biocontrol intervention, and promotion of diet diversity through
agriculture extension workers‚Äîand four delivered through the education sector‚Äîschool-based
deworming, school-based treatment of bilharzia, school-based promotion of good hygiene, and
school feeding. Other potential nutrition-sensitive interventions include the reduction of women‚Äôs
workloads through appropriate technologies in agriculture, social safety nets and conditional cash
transfers targeted to the poor and designed to have an impact on nutrition outcomes, and water
and sanitation programs that reduce the exposure to infections and childhood diseases. However,
because of data unavailability or the absence of delivery platforms, these interventions were not
included. Cost and benefit estimates (where possible) for the seven nutrition-sensitive
interventions described here are presented in Part II.

Biofortification has the potential to reduce micronutrient deficiencies in a highly cost-effective
manner. Biofortification uses plant breeding techniques to enhance the micronutrient content of
staple foods; in Zambia the focus is on fortifying maize with beta-carotene, which the body
converts to vitamin A. The crossbreeding process causes the maize to take on an orange color.
Over 60 percent of the total area planted in major crops in Zambia has been planted in maize and
maize dominates the Zambian diet, accounting for more than half of available energy. A recent
study by HarvestPlus that ranked countries according to their suitability for investment in
biofortification interventions identified Zambia as a ‚Äútop priority‚Äù country in its ability to benefit from
the biofortification of maize (Asare-Marfo et al. 2013). A more recent ex-ante cost study of high
vitamin A maize in Zambia suggests that the cost per DALY averted is considered cost-effective,
but requires a long-term commitment for implementation (Fiedler and Lividini forthcoming). In
another analysis, Fiedler and Lividini show how high vitamin A maize biofortication is a key


                                                    24
component in addressing vitamin A deficiency in Zambia in a cost-effective way (Fiedler and
Lividini 2014).

Based on analysis from other countries, biocontrol of aflatoxins has the potential to reduce
aflatoxins in maize and groundnuts by at least 80 to 90 percent (Bandyopadhyay and Cotty 2013).
Field testing of biocontrol products in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal, although not
formally published, is producing extremely positive results. The method involves a single
application of a product (aflasafeTM) containing strains unique to that country. The U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID) is currently supporting a project on the mitigation of
aflatoxin in maize and groundnuts in Zambia (2012‚Äì15) (USAID Zambia 2011). During 2012,
researchers from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), the Zambia Agriculture
Research Institute (ZARI), and the National Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research (NISIR)
developed nonpoison forming strains of fungi to test in the field. In January 2013, the Zambian
aflasafeTM began being applied to fields in the Eastern Province of Zambia (IITA 2013). IITA
recommends that farmers apply aflasafeTM -Zambia 30 to 40 days after planting and at a rate of
10 kg/ha for optimum efficacy (IITA 2014).

Research from other countries has shown the success of agricultural programs to promote diet
diversity in improving nutrition and feeding practices of young children. The promotion of diet
diversity includes the delivery of basic food security and nutrition messages around specific crops
via agricultural extension agents. The approach is most effective if messages are targeted toward
the farmers growing the crop, and packaged together with delivery of seeds or other pertinent
information about the crop, including storage and food preparation methods. In many contexts, it
is usual for such a worker to talk to farm households about both food production and consumption
decisions. Given the reality that food security and nutrition messages are most likely to be
delivered effectively by and to women, it is important to employ female extension workers in
contexts where the social norm prevents women from interacting with non-family males.

School-based deworming has been proven to be an efficient and cost-effective intervention to
address health and nutrition outcomes in other settings, with cost per DALY averted estimated at
$4.55 (J-PAL 2012). Delivering deworming tablets through schools is inexpensive because it uses
existing infrastructure and delivery platforms in schools and community links with teachers.
Teachers need only minimal training to safely administer the tablets, so their workloads are not
significantly increased. On the other hand, the benefits of school-based deworming are enormous.
Bi-annual deworming significantly boosted school attendance and reduced self-reported illness
and anemia, while providing modest gains in height-for-age Z-scores (J-PAL 2012). Evidence
from India also suggests that deworming has the potential to reduce cases of childhood stunting
and underweight (Awasthi et al. 2013). In the long term, deworming improved self-reported health,
increased total schooling years, and raised earnings by 20 percent (Baird et al. 2011). In Zambia,
a USAID-supported program called Changes2 was implemented in 2005‚Äì09; this program trained
teachers in school-based deworming in four southern provinces. Zambia hopes to expand this
program to provide semi-annual deworming to all primary and secondary students.

Improved hygiene behaviors through school-based promotion of handwashing and other good
hygiene behavior could decrease the risk of stunting in one in three children. Correct handwashing
at critical times can reduce the severity of diarrhea by 42 to 47 percent, lower the incidence of
diarrhea for children by 53 percent, and reduce the incidence of acute respiratory infections by 44
percent in Nigeria (where the World Bank conducted a study on the impact of poor sanitation;
World Bank 2012a)‚Äîthereby reducing child stunting. A recent campaign (WASH) to promote
handwashing with soap in primary schools in China, Colombia, and Egypt demonstrated
significant reduction in absenteeism related to diarrhea and respiratory illness (UNICEF 2012). A

                                                25
study in Brazil showed a relationship between the effects of early childhood diarrhea on later
school readiness and school performance, revealing the potential long-term human and economic
costs of early childhood diarrhea (Lorntz et al. 2006).

The effectiveness of promoting good hygiene behavior in schools is demonstrated by the long-
term impact and broad effect of good hygiene on communities. Schools are ideal settings for
hygiene education: children can learn and sustain lifelong proper hygiene practices through peer-
to-peer teaching, classroom sessions with focused training materials, and role playing or
interactive songs. A study on the long-term effects of hygiene education programs for both adults
and children found that hygiene behaviors are sustained beyond the end of an intervention. The
study also found that educated students can also influence family members by sharing this
information, which may in turn affect behavior change at the community level (Bolt and Cairncross
2004).


          NATIONAL AND PARTNER EFFORTS TO ADDRESS MALNUTRITION IN ZAMBIA

Nutrition interventions in Zambia are coordinated by the National Food and Nutrition Commission
(NFNC), which has set out an initiative to expand nutrition interventions during 2011‚Äì15 (NFNC
of Zambia 2012). This Five-Year National Food and Nutrition Strategic Plan (NFNSP) 2011‚Äì15 is
Zambia's first multisectoral response to combat malnutrition. It focuses on 10 key strategic
directions related to improving food and nutrition, with a major focus on strengthening and
expanding interventions to promote the First 1000 Most Critical Days Programme that prevents
stunting in children less than two years of age.

Major external support for nutrition comes from the U.K. Department for International
Development (DFID), the European Union (EU), Irish Aid, teh Swedish International Development
Cooperation Authority (Sida), the World Bank, and the Global Agriculture and Food Security
Programme (GAFSP) (REACH 2014). DFID, Irish Aid, and Sida support a program managed by
CARE to support the government‚Äôs First 1000 Most Critical Days Programme. The World Bank
will soon support the Health Services Improvement project, which has a component to improve
primary health care, including a plan to scale up high-impact nutrition interventions (World Bank
2013). The EU supports a focus on maternal and child care at the district level. (Appendix 1
provides a detailed list of donor activities.)

Several partners are working to improve nutrition by investing in the agricultural sector. The EU
is supporting conservation agriculture with a nutrition component (REACH 2014). The GAFSP
supports a food security and nutrition program. HarvestPlus is also active in Zambia, developing
and disseminating a variety of vitamin A‚Äìrich maize that is intended to provide 50 percent of mean
requirements for vitamin A requirements (Fiedler and Lividini 2014, forthcoming). USAID is
supporting a program to reduce aflatoxins in maize and groundnuts and thereby improve
nutritional status (USAID 2011; IITA 2013, 2014).

         PART II ‚Äì COSTED SCALE-UP SCENARIOS: RATIONALE,
            OBJECTIVES, METHODOLOGY, AND RESULTS
                         RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE ANALYSIS

The overall objective of this costing analysis is to support the Government of Zambia in developing
a costed scale-up plan for nutrition. It will provide the government with the tools it needs to
leverage adequate resources from domestic budgets as well as from development partners in
support of the costed scale-up plan. Within this context, the objectives of this analysis are as
follows:

   ‚Ä¢   To estimate scale-up costs in Zambia for a set of well-proven nutrition-specific
       interventions that have the potential to be scaled up through tested delivery mechanisms
   ‚Ä¢   To conduct a basic economic analysis to calculate the potential benefits and cost-
       effectiveness associated with the proposed scale-up
   ‚Ä¢   To propose a series of scenarios for a costed scale-up plan that rolls out this package of
       nutrition-specific interventions in phases, based on considerations of impact, geography,
       implementation capacity, and cost
   ‚Ä¢   To explore initial costs for a limited number of nutrition-sensitive interventions through the
       agriculture, education, and water and sanitation sectors

Although the economic arguments for increasing investments in nutrition are sound, one of the
first questions raised by key decision makers in any country is ‚ÄúHow much will it cost?‚Äù In 2010,
the World Bank spearheaded a study called Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost? to answer
that question at the global level. The analysis estimated the level of global financing required to
scale up 10 evidence-based nutrition-specific interventions in 36 countries that account for 90
percent of the world‚Äôs stunting burden and 32 smaller countries that also have a high prevalence
of undernutrition. The results of the study highlighted the global financing gap, underscored the
importance of investing in nutrition at the global level, and laid out a methodology for estimating
the costs of nutrition-specific interventions. However, these global estimates did not capture the
nuances and context in each country, nor were these estimates contextualized to every individual
country‚Äôs policy and capacity setting or its fiscal constraints. This report builds on the early work
to address this gap and contextualize the cost estimates for Zambia.

The multisectoral approach requires nutrition-sensitive approaches or interventions that can be
delivered through other sectors. As discussed above, globally there is currently very limited
guidance on costing for nutrition-sensitive interventions. Therefore this report provides an
exploratory analysis to be used primarily to engage other sectors in planning for improved
nutritional outcomes. This initial exercise will contribute to a broader discussion about
methodological and other issues for costing nutrition-sensitive interventions, and will thereby
encourage the formulation of standard definitions, methodologies, and guidance for costing these
interventions in the future.

              SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTIONS

The costed scale-up plan is presented in two sections. The first section presents estimated costs
and benefits for the set of 10 nutrition-specific interventions that have strong evidence of impact
and were included in the World Bank‚Äôs Scaling Up Nutrition report (2010) and are delivered
primarily through the health sector. These interventions and the associated target population and
current coverage for each intervention are specified in Table 1.

The nutrition-specific interventions considered are a modified package of the interventions
included in the 2008 and 2013 Lancet series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition, tailored to the
Zambian context. These 10 interventions are based on current scientific evidence and there is
general consensus from the global community about their impact. Some interventions‚Äîsuch as
deworming and iron-fortification of staple foods‚Äîthat were included in the 2008 Lancet series but
not listed in the 2013 Lancet series are included here because they remain relevant to Zambia.
Others‚Äîsuch as calcium supplementation for women and prophylactic zinc supplementation‚Äî
are excluded because delivery mechanisms are not available in client countries, including
Zambia, and/or there are no clear WHO protocols or guidelines for large-scale programming. In
other cases, there are limited capacities for scaling up the interventions. Only those nutrition-
specific interventions that are relevant to the Zambian context and that have strong evidence of
effectiveness, a WHO protocol, and a feasible delivery mechanism for scale-up are included in
the proposed scale-up package below. As this evidence base grows, other interventions can be
added over time.

The analysis in the following section focuses on nutrition-sensitive interventions that are relevant
to the Zambian context and that have the potential to have an impact on nutrition outcomes. A
description of these interventions, associated target populations, and responsible sectors are
listed in Table 2. As discussed above, the evidence base for nutrition-sensitive interventions is
not as strong as it is for nutrition-specific interventions. Therefore, these estimates are exploratory
and are limited to six potential interventions relevant to the Zambian context that can be scaled
up and have potential for impact on nutrition outcomes. Additional interventions were not included
in these initial estimates because their impact on nutrition is yet to be clearly documented (Masset
et al. 2011; Ruel et al. 2013; World Bank 2013), because this is an exploratory instead of an
exhaustive effort, or because they were not considered relevant to the needs of Zambia.
Furthermore, cost attribution is complex because these nutrition-sensitive interventions are
designed for multiple purposes.

 ESTIMATION OF TARGET POPULATION SIZES, CURRENT COVERAGE LEVELS AND UNIT COSTS

Target population estimates are based primarily on demographic data obtained from the
population projection derived from the Population Census 2010 (see Appendix 2). The prevalence
of child stunting (height-for-age Z-score <‚àí2), underweight (weight-for-age Z-score <‚àí2), and
severe wasting (weight-for-height Z-score <‚àí3) among children under five years of age in each
province were obtained from the Zambia 2013‚Äì14 DHS.



                                                    30
Data on current coverage levels for interventions were obtained from various sources. Current
coverage levels for community nutrition programs for behavior change communication, zinc
supplementation, multiple micronutrient powders for children to fortify homemade complementary
food, maternal multiple micronutrients supplementation, iron fortification of staple foods, and
public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition were
set to 0 percent either because interventions were not being implemented or because coverage
was very minimal or reliable data were not available. Coverage data for vitamin A
supplementation, deworming, iron-folic acid supplements for pregnant women, and households
consuming adequately iodized salt were obtained from the Zambia 2013‚Äì14 DHS. 2 Finally, the
Ministry of Health provided data on the number of children treated for severe acute malnutrition
where programs for integrated management of acute malnutrition are in operation. The estimates
of the current incidence of severe acute malnutrition and moderately acute malnutrition,
underweight, and stunting (which were used to classify the provinces according to levels of
stunting) were all obtained from the Zambia 2013‚Äì14 DHS.

Whenever possible, the unit costs of the nutrition-specific interventions were estimated using
programmatic data provided by the Ministry of Health and local implementing partners based on
program experience. For some of the interventions, the delivery cost from the district plan (Kaputa
and Mumbwa) was used as estimates for the unit cost at district level, which then combined with
national-level data to obtain full estimates of intervention costs. The estimated unit costs and the
delivery platforms are listed in Table 3. In cases where the intervention was not yet implemented
or local data were not available, the global unit cost estimate from the World Bank (2010) was
used. A complete index of data sources and relevant assumptions for these interventions is
provided in Appendix 3.

For nutrition-sensitive interventions in the agriculture sector, the unit costs were estimated using
programmatic cost data from Zambia with the exception of aflatoxin control, which comes from
Nigeria. The unit costs and the delivery platforms are listed in Table 4. The unit costs for
biofortification of orange maize and orange sweet potato are composed of two main elements:
the cost of the seeds and the cost of the promotion. Estimates of seed costs come from
HarvestPlus and estimates of promotion activity costs come from the Ministry of Health. The unit
cost does not include research and development or adaptive breeding activities since these
phases were already completed. The unit cost for aflasafeTM per hectare comes from the
International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria (Bandyopadhyay 2013) and is
considered a best approximation of costs for Zambia. This cost estimate includes material and
distribution costs. The unit cost for the promotion of diet diversification comes from the Ministry of
Agriculture, which estimates the total cost for promotional activities through the agriculture sector
for each district: assuming 20,000 farmers per district, that yields a unit cost of $2.10 per farmer.

Unit costs for interventions in the education sector come mostly from the Ministry of Education.
The unit costs for school-based deworming, school-based treatment of bilharzias, and school
feeding intervention used in the calculation are obtained from the Ministry of Education. The major
cost components for deworming are human resources, surveillance and mapping, non-donated
drugs, advocacy, infrastructure and logistics, and implementation and management. No unit cost
estimates are available for school-based promotion of good hygiene for Zambia, so the unit cost

proxy. This includes the cost of capacity building, monitoring, advocacy, and social mobilization.

                                           ESTIMATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS

The program experience methodology employed in Scaling Up Nutrition. What Will It Cost? (World
Bank 2010) is used for calculating the cost of scaling up in Zambia. This approach generates unit
cost data that capture all aspects of service delivery (e.g., costs of commodities, transportation
and storage, personnel, training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, relevant overhead,
wastage, etc.) for each intervention from actual programs that are already in operation in Zambia
and considers the context in which they are delivered. Another commonly used method is the
ingredients approach in which selected activities are bundled into appropriate delivery packages
(for example, number of visits to a health center) (see, e.g., Bhutta et al. 2013). Although the
program experience approach tends to yield cost estimates that are higher than the ingredients
approach, these estimates more accurately reflect real programmatic experience, including
inefficiencies in service delivery. It should, however, be noted that the calculated costs are
reported in financial or budgetary terms. They do not capture the full social resource requirements,
which account for the opportunity costs of the time committed by beneficiaries accessing the
services.

We calculate the annual public investment required to scale up the interventions as follows:

         Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å = (Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 + Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 ) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3

where:


                                                          33
           Y = annual public investment required to scale up to full coverage 3
           Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 = additional total cost to scale up to full coverage
           Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
           Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3 = cost covered by households living above poverty line for selected interventions

Appendix 4 describes the methodology in detail.

The expected benefits from scaling up nutrition interventions are calculated in terms of (1) DALYs
averted, (2) number of lives saved, (3) cases of childhood stunting averted, and (4) increased
program coverage. To calculate the number of DALYs, we use the method employed by Black et
al. (2008) to estimate the averted morbidity and mortality from scaling up different nutrition
interventions. The method uses population attributable fractions (PAF) based on the comparative
risk assessment project (Ezzati et al. 2004; Ezzati et al. 2002) to estimate the burden of infectious
diseases attributable to different forms of undernutrition using most recent Global Burden of
Disease Study (IHME 2010). The estimation of DALYs averted is limited to 8 of the 10
interventions in the package. 4 Appendix 5 describes the detailed methodology for estimating
DALYs. The projected number of lives saved and cases of childhood stunting averted is
calculated using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), which translates measured coverage changes into
estimates of mortality reduction and cases of childhood stunting averted. Because of the
limitations of LiST, it was possible to estimate the lives saved for only seven interventions, 5 and
the cases of child stunting averted for five interventions. 6 Appendix 6 describes the methodology
for the LiST estimates. The increased program coverage is calculated by subtracting the current
coverage rate from full coverage and multiplying this difference by the size of the target population
for each intervention.

The measures for cost-effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions are calculated in terms of
cost per DALY averted, cost per life saved, and cost per case of stunting averted. Estimates of
benefits were combined with information on costs to produce the cost-effectiveness measures for
each intervention as well as for the overall package of intervention. The evaluation of the cost-
effectiveness ratio in terms of DALYs averted is based on the categorization used by WHO-
CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective): 7 an intervention is considered to be
‚Äúvery cost-effective‚Äù if the range for the cost per DALY averted is less than GDP per capita; 8 ‚Äúcost-

3   Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except for
        community-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to be
        80 percent.
4   Because of limitations in the estimation tool, it was not possible to calculate estimates for two
       interventions: iron fortification of staples and salt iodization.
5   The seven interventions are breastfeeding and complementary feeding promotion, vitamin A
       supplementation, therapeutic zinc supplementation with oral rehydration solution, iron-folic acid
       supplementation, maternal multiple micronutrient supplementation, the public provision of
       complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, and community-based
       management of severe acute malnutrition.
6   The five interventions are breastfeeding and complementary feeding promotion, vitamin A
       supplementation, iron-folic acid supplementation, maternal multiple micronutrient supplementation,
       and the public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition.

effective‚Äù if it is between one and three times GDP per capita; and ‚Äúnot cost-effective‚Äù if it exceeds
three times GDP per capita (WHO 2014).

Cost-benefit analysis is based on the estimated economic value of the benefits attributable to
nutrition-specific interventions. In order to arrive at a dollar value for the impact on mortality and
morbidity of a one-year investment in reaching full national coverage, we use estimates of the
number of lives saved and the reduction in stunting prevalence produced by the LiST tool.
Consistent with the methodology used to quantify the benefits of health and nutrition interventions
in Stenberg et al. (2014), a statistical life year saved is valued as equivalent to gross national
income (GNI) per capita; this is considered to be a conservative measure because it accounts for
only the economic, not the social, value of a year of life. In order to estimate the value of the
reduction in stunting, we follow the methodology used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), which values a
year of life lived without stunting. 9 Future benefits are then age-adjusted and discounted at three
potential discount rates (3, 5, and 7 percent) in order to arrive at their present value. The present
value of future benefits is then compared with the annual public investment required, which allows
us to estimate the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return of the investment. A detailed
explanation of the benefit estimation methodology can be found in Appendix 7.

The annual increase in economic productivity over the productive lives of beneficiaries attributable
to each package of interventions is calculated based on the same estimates of future benefits.
Although these benefits occur several years after the investment, we assume that they serve as
an approximation of the present value of economic productivity lost each year as a result of
mortality and morbidity that would otherwise be prevented by scaling up nutrition interventions.
Values presented are taken from a year in which all beneficiaries have reached productive age.

The approach for estimating the potential costs and benefits of nutrition-sensitive interventions
differs from the methodology used for nutrition-specific interventions. Similar to nutrition- specific
interventions, the total cost for scaling up the interventions is calculated by multiplying the unit
cost by the target population (either local Zambian unit costs or regional unit costs are used,
depending on availability). However, since most nutrition-sensitive interventions have multiple
objectives, it is not always feasible to attribute the nutrition-related benefits to the overall costs of
the interventions. Because these constraints limit the accuracy of cost-effectiveness estimates,
we instead rely on secondary sources and published literature when available, with cost-
effectiveness presented in terms of cost per DALY averted.



                         SCENARIOS FOR SCALING UP NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS

When estimating the costs and benefits of scaling up nutrition interventions, we begin with
estimates for scaling up all 10 interventions to full national coverage, followed by estimates for
various scale-up scenarios. The full-coverage estimates can be considered the medium-term
policy goal for the Government of Zambia, but resource constraints will likely limit the
government‚Äôs ability to achieve full national coverage in the short term. Therefore we also propose
four scenarios for prioritizing the scale-up of nutrition interventions over a short-term time frame
of five years:



9   Hoddinott et al. (2013) assume that stunted individuals lose an average of 66 percent of potential
      lifetime earnings.

                                                      35
   ‚Ä¢   Scenario 1: Scale up by province
   ‚Ä¢   Scenario 2: Scale up by intervention
   ‚Ä¢   Scenario 3: Scale up by province and intervention
   ‚Ä¢   Scenario 4: Scale up by varying program coverage

Within each scenario we consider variations and analyze their cost-effectiveness in terms of cost
per DALY averted, cost per life saved, and cost per case of childhood stunting averted. After our
initial analysis, we present the most attractive scale-up scenarios and discuss them in more detail.

Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except the
treatment of severe acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to be 80 percent. This
definition is consistent with the methodology used in World Bank (2010) and is based on the
reality that few community-based treatment programs have successfully achieved more than 80
percent coverage at scale. Under Scenario 4 we also propose several ‚Äúpartial coverage‚Äù
scenarios that reduce coverage targets.

   PART III ‚Äì RESULTS FOR NUTRITION-SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS
                TOTAL COST, EXPECTED BENEFITS, AND COST EFFECTIVENESS
The total additional public investment required to scale up 10 nutrition-specific interventions from
current coverage levels to full coverage at the national level in Zambia is estimated to be $40.5
million annually (Table 5). This cost includes the additional cost of scaling up all 10 interventions
across the entire country ($46.1 million per year) plus additional resources for monitoring and
evaluation (M&E), operations research and technical support, and capacity development for
program delivery (estimated at $5.0 million). Of this total amount of $51.2 million, part of the costs
for iron fortification, multiple micronutrient powders for children, salt iodization, and the public
provision of complementary foods for moderate acute malnutrition could be covered from private
resources from households above the poverty line (estimated at $10.7 million), which leaves a
financing gap of $40.5 million for a full scale-up nationwide.

country are enormous (Table 6). Once the interventions are scaled up to 100 percent, 112,545
DALYs and 2,859 lives would be saved annually, while 62,195 cases of stunting among children
under five would be averted annually. Program coverage is assumed to expand as follows:

   ‚Ä¢   1.1 million families with children 0‚Äì23 months of age would be reached by community

Note: ORS = oral rehydration salts; ‚Äî = not available.
a. DALY estimates in this study are neither discounted nor age-weighted, in line with the methodology
used in the IHME Global Burden of Disease 2010 and the WHO Global Health Estimates 2012. For more
information on the methodology used to calculate DALYs averted, see Appendix 5.
b. DALY estimates for iron-folic acid supplementation are calculated for DALYs averted among pregnant
women. They do not include the DALYs averted among children born to mothers who received these
supplements.
c. The total of the interventions implemented simultaneously does not equal to the sum of the individual
interventions. This is because some interventions affect nutrition outcomes via similar pathways, causing
their combined impact to be different than the individual sums.

For the package as a whole, the total cost per DALY averted is estimated to be $410, the total
cost per life saved is estimated to be $16,126, and the total cost per case of stunting averted is
estimated to be $741 (Table 7). 10 Variation in cost-effectiveness among the interventions is high,
with costs per DALY averted ranging from $72 for zinc supplementation to $796 for the public
provision of complementary foods. Overall, these cost estimates translate into an increase in
annual public resource requirements of $14.42 per child. This compares favorably to global
estimates of $30 per child calculated in World Bank (2010).

All 10 proposed nutrition-specific interventions are ‚Äúvery cost-effective‚Äù according to the
WHO/CHOICE criteria (WHO 2014). As shown in Table 7, these 10 intervention are ‚Äúvery cost-
effective‚Äù in that the cost per DALY averted is below the Zambian GDP per capita of $1,540 in
2013 (World Bank 2014). Although public provision of complementary food for the prevention of
moderate acute malnutrition is cost-effective with the cost per DALY averted estimated of $796,
it is the least cost-effective of the 10 interventions considered. In countries such as Zambia where
fiscal and capacity constraints limit scale-up, the public provision of complementary foods may be
a lower priority. Issues of governance, accountability, and supply logistics will further constrain
the scale-up of the public provision of complementary foods.




10   For the total cost per benefit unit, we divide the total annual program cost for all 10 interventions
       (excluding M&E, and capacity development costs, but before subtracting household contributions) by
       the benefits estimates available. Because of limitations of the LiST tool, DALYs averted estimates

                                 POTENTIAL SCALE-UP SCENARIOS

Scenario 1: Scaling Up by Province
Table 8 shows the estimated costs and benefits of scaling up the 10 nutrition-specific
interventions by province. The provinces are grouped according to the rate of stunting
prevalence in 2013‚Äì14: those with higher prevalence (stunting over 40 percent) and those
with lower prevalence (stunting between 35 and 39 percent). The lack of wide variation in
                                                    40
stunting rates across provinces, combined with the fact that provinces in the lower
prevalence category have (collectively) a greater population and therefore a higher total
number of stunted children, means that it is hard to prioritize some provinces over others,
as demonstrated in Table 8. Concentrating on the five highest prevalence provinces
would require $20.7 million and avert over 58,000 DALYs and save over 1,200 lives,
whereas addressing stunting in the lower prevalence provinces would cost $19.8 million
and avert almost 70,000 DALYs and save over 1,500 lives.

Scenario 2: Scaling Up by Intervention
Scenario 2 is based on a stepwise scale-up by intervention. The primary considerations for
choosing the interventions in each step are cost effectiveness, recommended phasing of
interventions, implementation capacity, and delivery mechanisms. The proposed plan for a
stepwise scale-up by intervention is summarized below and illustrated in Figure 9.

   ‚Ä¢   Step 1 focuses on a package of primarily preventive interventions that can be scaled up
       quickly, either with existing capacities or with modest investment in capacity-building for
       community nutrition programs for breastfeeding and complementary feeding promotion
       and child health days. It also includes community-based treatment of severe acute
       malnutrition at 30 percent coverage. The cost of Step 1 is $17.6 million. An additional $1.6
       million for capacity development and $0.4 million for monitoring and evaluation, operations
       research, and technical support is budgeted, which brings the total cost of Step 1 to $19.5
       million. The portion of scale-up costs that could be covered by households above the
       poverty line is estimated at $1.9 million. Therefore the total public investment required
       for Step 1 is estimated at $17.6 million.
   ‚Ä¢   Step 2 includes the costs of a full scale-up of treatment for severe acute malnutrition from
       a base of 30 percent in Step 1 to 50 percent coverage, with the assumption that additional
       implementation capacities are built in Step 1. The estimated cost of this scale-up is $5.5
       million. We also include an additional $0.5 million for capacity development and $0.1
       million for monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical support in Step
       2, which brings the total public investment required for Step 2 to $6.2 million. (There
       is no household contribution for this intervention.)
   ‚Ä¢   Step 3 adds scaling up of the public provision of complementary foods to prevent and
       treat moderate malnutrition among children under two years of age. The total cost of this
       intervention is $23.0 million. We also include an additional $2.1 million for capacity
       development and $0.5 million for monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and
       technical support. Of the total cost of $25.5 million, an estimated $8.8 million could be
       resourced from private resources in households above the poverty line. This brings the
       estimated public investment required for Step 3 to $16.7 million.

Step 3 interventions are assigned the lowest priority for the following reasons: (1) the 2013 Lancet
nutrition series concluded that there are no additional benefits to public provision of
complementary foods beyond those provided by dietary counseling and education; (2) at $796
per DALY averted, the public provision of complementary foods for the preventions of moderate
acute malnutrition is not as cost-effective as other key interventions (as discussed above); (3) the
total cost of complementary foods is overwhelming and accounts for more than half cost of the
total cost of scaling up all interventions, while the benefits as estimated lives saved or DALYs
averted are lower than other interventions; (4) governance, accountability, supply-chain, and
logistics are key challenges associated with large-scale food distribution. The estimated benefits
do not outweigh these risks, and the costs are high when compared with other interventions.
Under these circumstances, rapid scale-up is neither feasible nor recommended.

Note: There is no household contribution for Step 2 interventions.

The preferred scale-up scenario would be to scale up Step 1 and Step 2 interventions, requiring
an annual public investment of $23.7 million. As shown in Table 9, this would avert 99,379 DALYs
and save 2,358 lives. It would also provide the following additional program coverage:

    ‚Ä¢   1.1 million families with children 0‚Äì23 months of age would be reached by community
        programs for breastfeeding and complementary feeding promotion
    ‚Ä¢   601,000 additional children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-
        saving vitamin A supplementation
    ‚Ä¢   2.6 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive zinc supplementation as part of
        diarrhea management
    ‚Ä¢   640,000 children 6‚Äì23 months of age would receive vitamins and minerals through
        multiple micronutrient powders

    ‚Ä¢   24,000 million pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their
        antenatal care

Scenario 3: Scaling Up by Province and by Intervention

Scenario 3 is a hybrid of Scenarios 1 and 2 and proposes the scaling up by province and by
selected interventions as listed in Table 10 below. The preferred scenario is to scale up Step
1 and Step 2 interventions in provinces where stunting rates exceed 40 percent (the higher
prevalence provinces). This requires an annual public investment of $10.8 million and
averts 45,056 DALYs and saves 1,042 lives (Table 11).

Scenario 3 would provide the following program benefits:


‚Ä¢     0.5 million families with children 0‚Äì23 months of age would be reached by community
      programs for breastfeeding and complementary feeding promotion
‚Ä¢     0.2 million children 6‚Äì59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving vitamin

The first possibility (4a) under Scenario 4 would scale up all interventions to the partial coverage

                         COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF ALL SCENARIOS

When considered in terms of cost-effectiveness (cost per benefit unit) and total resources
required, Scenarios 2 and 4b stand out as the most attractive. Table 14 presents a comparison
of the costs and benefits of the scenarios considered in this analysis. Based on cost per DALY
averted, the two most cost-effective scenarios (2 and 4b) both involve scaling up nine of the 10
interventions. The excluded intervention is the public provision of complementary foods for the
prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, which is not nearly as cost-effective as the other nine
interventions. Scenario 4b is the most cost-effective, with a cost per DALY averted of $166, and
would scale up the nine interventions to partial coverage levels nationwide. This scenario would
require $11.2 million annually and would avert over 69,000 DALYs, save almost 1,700 lives, and
prevent over 22,000 cases of stunting. Although Scenarios 2 and 3 are equally cost-effective, at
a cost of about $230 per DALY averted and $9,750 per life saved, Scenario 2 would provide
benefits nationwide, making it more politically feasible. This option would require a larger annual
public investment of $23.7 million, but would also avert over 99,000 DALYs and save over 2,300
lives. The choice between these two scenarios will mainly depend on the level of resources
Zambia is able to leverage for nutrition interventions.

                    ESTIMATED COSTS OVER A FIVE-YEAR SCALE-UP PERIOD

Until this point in the analysis, the costs are presented assuming scale-up over a one year.
However, recognizing that a slower, incremental scale up may be more feasible, we also estimate
the cost for scaling up selected scenarios over a five-year time frame (Table 15). A five-year scale
up of all 10 interventions nationwide is estimated to cost $134.5 million, whereas Scenario 2 would
require an investment of $70.8 million and Scenario 4b would require $34.7 million. Interventions
are assumed to scale from current coverage as follows: 20 percent of scale up in Year 1, 40
percent in Year 2, 60 percent in Year 3, 80 percent in Year 4, and 100 percent in Year 5. For
these calculations, we consider the expenditures on capacity development and system
strengthening required to scale to full coverage to be a fixed cost, with some additional funds
allocated to refresher training and rehiring in the years after scale has been reached. Thus, the
average annual amount spent on capacity development is allocated across the five years, rather
than increasing in proportion to coverage as is the case with the other costs.

                    ESTIMATED ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

A high burden of malnutrition negatively impacts a nation‚Äôs human capital. An investment in
improving nutrition outcomes among Zambian children is therefore also an investment in the
country‚Äôs economic future. The two main ways in which malnutrition affects economic productivity
are increased mortality and morbidity‚Äîin other words, lives lost and years lived with a disease or
disability. For the purposes of this analysis, we estimate the potential economic benefits of scaling
up nutrition interventions in terms of lives saved (reduction in mortality) and cases of stunting
averted (reduction in morbidity). Because each life lost results in one less citizen contributing to
the nation‚Äôs economy, and because stunted children tend to earn and consume less, these impact
estimates help us to arrive at approximations of the return on investment attributable to the scale-
up of a particular package of interventions.

The economic benefits of investing in these effective nutrition interventions are tremendous (Table
16). Scaling up all 10 interventions nationwide could produce an annual increase of $915 million
in national economic productivity over the productive lives of the children affected. Investing in
the lower-cost Scenario 4a would also produce an annual increase, of $496 million, in national
economic productivity over the lives of the children affected. (Because of methodological
limitations, we were not able to calculate the increases in economic productivity for the other
scenarios.)

These estimates of economic benefits are based on a conservative methodology that does not
necessarily account for all of the potential benefits associated with improving nutrition outcomes
among Zambian children. For example, these figures do not account for future growth in GDP per
capita, which would also be expected to increase with improved nutritional outcomes.
Furthermore, it is likely that these estimated increases in GDP would also improve equity in
Zambia because productivity among the poor would benefit the most from improved nutritional
outcomes.

Our analyses also show that these nutrition interventions are excellent economic investments
(Table 16). Because an increase in the assumed discount rate reduces the present value of future

                                                     49
benefits, we present the results using three possible discount rates: 3, 5, and 7 percent. Both
scenarios show highly positive net present values across this range of discount rates, indicating
that they are an excellent economic investment. In addition, each of the scenarios would yield a
highly positive internal rate of return, another indicator that it is an excellent economic investment.

                                     FINANCING NUTRITION IN ZAMBIA

The cost-effectiveness analysis presented here identifies an annual financing gap of at least $11.2
million (Scenario 4b) to $23.7 million (Scenario 2). This is above and beyond the $15.6 million of
government and donor funds currently financing nutrition interventions in Zambia (Table 17).
Some of the donor contributions, especially the $7.5 million from the United States, may be
overestimated. The government budget for 2013 appropriated $1.5 to nutrition interventions. This
is an increase of only $300,000 over the previous year and represents only 2 percent of the
additional resources needed for even the most modest scale-up scenario.

Some preliminary information is available regarding donor pledges for 2014 to 2016; this
information suggests that more than $37 million is pledged for this three-year period (Table 18). 11
This represents a dramatic increase and will go a long way toward financing the needed
interventions. Nevertheless, it will not cover both the current expenditures (about $16 million per
year) and the additional resources needed for either of the most cost-effective scenarios identified
in this analysis: Scenario 2 ($23.7million per year) or Scenario 4b ($11.2 million per year). It will
therefore be essential to leverage additional government resources for nutrition interventions,
rather than continued exclusive reliance on donor aid.

                            UNCERTAINTIES AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
Because actual unit costs may differ from our estimates, it is important to consider the effects of
both an increase and a decrease in these costs on the overall price of the interventions. This
uncertainty is greatest for higher-cost interventions, and less significant for those with lower costs.
For example, given the prevalence of information on and experience with less expensive
micronutrient and deworming interventions, there is a higher degree of certainty around their
estimated costs and financing needs. On the other hand, the costs of community nutrition
programs can vary greatly depending on their context, the intensity of behavior change
campaigns, the number of community health workers employed, and the amount of incentives
provided to them‚Äîall of these affect unit costs. Finally, there is very little information concerning
the costs of public provision of complementary foods for prevention of moderate acute
malnutrition. In Zambia, there is no delivery mechanism that can be used as a reference for the
public provision of complementary foods, while unit costs depend on the type of food provided as
well as the choice of targeting method. Other factors, such as widespread governance concerns
and diversion of the food, also need to be considered. In order to account for these uncertainties,
we perform a partial sensitivity analysis that describes the impact of variation in unit costs while
holding other variables constant. These results are presented in Appendix 8.

   NUTRITION-SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED THROUGH THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR

The estimated total cost of scaling up biofortification of vitamin A-rich (orange) maize is $20.8
million and of vitamin A-rich (orange) sweet potato is $11.2 million. This is based on the
assumption that 50,000 hectares of each breed would be planted in Zambia. Cost per DALY
averted for vitamin A-rich maize is estimated at $24 for Zambia, resulted in an estimated
1,208,012 DALYs averted (Fiedler and Lividini 2014). Ex-ante global estimates for vitamin A-rich
sweet potato are estimated at $32 (Meenakshi et al. 2010). Meenakshi and colleagues also

                                                  52
estimated benefit-cost ratios for maize in Ethiopia and Kenya of between 2 (a pessimistic
estimate) and 47 (an optimistic one), and benefit-cost ratios for sweet potato in Uganda of
between 17 and 58 (Meenakshi et al. 2010). Taken together, these benefit estimates suggest
large potential benefits from biofortication in Zambia. Nevertheless, these interventions are much
more costly than the nutrition-specific interventions discussed in the previous section.

The total cost of scaling up aflatoxin reduction through biocontrol of maize is estimated to be
$22.7 million. The cost calculation uses the unit cost of aflasafeTM biocontrol developed by IITA
and tested in Nigeria, with a cost per hectare of approximately $15.6, including material and
distribution costs (Bandyopadhyay 2013). Crop area is based on the FAO‚Äôs 2010 projections of
Zambia maize planting area, which is estimated at a little over a million hectares. It is assumed
that aflasafeTM will be applied to all maize fields. 12 The estimated DALYs averted for biocontrol is
estimated at 511,628 and assumes a cost per DALY averted of $43 (Khlangwiset 2011). No
estimations are currently available for lives saved through aflatoxin control.


       NUTRITION-SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED THROUGH THE EDUCATION SECTOR

The cost of scaling up both school-based deworming and school-based treatment for bilharzia is
estimated to be $570,000 annually. The unit cost for deworming ($0.09) and treatment for
bilharzia ($0.27) used in the calculation is obtained from Ministry of Education. For deworming,
the unit cost estimate compares well with regional estimates of delivery cost in schools for Ghana
(Guyatt et al. 2003). The major cost components are human resources, surveillance and mapping,
non-donated drugs, advocacy, logistics and implementation, and management. The estimated
target population for school-based deworming is 3.5 million school-aged children (6‚Äì15 years old)
enrolled in primary and secondary schools; current coverage is assumed to be negligible.

The cost of scaling up school-based promotion of handwashing and good hygiene behavior is
estimated to be $7 million. Although the promotion of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in
schools normally includes sustainable, safe water supply points, handwashing stands, and
sanitation facilities, the costing includes only the component for hygiene education. The target
population is 3.5 million school-aged children (6‚Äì15 years old) enrolled in primary and secondary
schools; current coverage is assumed to be negligible.

The cost of scaling up school-based feeding program is estimated to be us $14.6 million. The unit
cost per child is estimated at $17 and is obtained from Ministry of Education. The school-based
feeding program is part of School Health and Nutrition program and is expected to reach 860,000
students.


           COMPARING NUTRITION-SPECIFIC AND NUTRITION-SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS

Overall, the nutrition-sensitive interventions considered here are much more costly than the
nutrition-specific interventions discussed in the previous section, with the exception of school-
based deworming. For example, the biofortification and aflatoxin reduction costed for the
agriculture sector would cost more than all of the nutrition-specific interventions proposed under

12   Most maize in Zambia is consumed by humans, but some is also consumed by livestock. We were not
       able to estimate how many hectares produce maize for human consumption versus other purposes,
       so we estimate the cost for all hectares of maize production.

                                                  53
Scenarios 2 and 4b. In addition, the evidence base demonstrating effectiveness in improving
nutrition through nutrition-sensitive interventions is significantly weaker than that for nutrition-
specific interventions. Taking these two factors together‚Äîthe costly nature of the interventions
and the weaker evidence on effectiveness‚Äîwe conclude that more pilot projects are needed
before prioritizing scarce resources for the nutrition-sensitive interventions considered here. The
exception is school-based deworming interventions, which are highly cost-effective and relatively
low cost.

                                   PART V: LIMITATIONS
Service delivery assumptions. These analyses focus on the costs of delivering direct nutrition
services using services modalities currently in place or that have the potential to be delivered at
scale. Where programs did not exist at scale, service delivery assumption were made for the
purpose of modeling scale-up costs. However, such decisions need to be reviewed and
modified based upon the discretion of implementing agencies. Efficiency gains could potentially
be made using alternative service delivery channels.

Our cost estimates are based on a number of assumptions regarding the supply of nutrition
services and interventions. First, we assume supply is the limiting factor and that additional
demand-generation activities are not necessary to stimulate the consumption of direct nutrition
interventions; improving the quality and availability of supply-side will be sufficient to increase
coverage to desired levels. This may not be true, particularly for interventions such as rice
fortification and the promotion of optimum infant and young child feeding, where non-costed
promotion efforts may be necessary to stimulate consumption. Second, we assume that the
capacity to absorb the additional financing and scale up the intervention either exists currently or
will be developed in the future. Further assessments of health system capacity‚Äîin terms of
infrastructure, supply chain effectiveness, and human resources for health‚Äîare needed to
determine whether this is indeed the case. Specifically, as a result of the absence of a human
resource time use study, we are limited in our assumption of the incremental nature of the human
resource costs included in our estimates.


Assumptions about unit costs. We have assumed that the average unit cost will not change over
the next 10 years. It is possible that the delivery of certain services will improve over time thanks
to economies of scale, increased efficiency in service delivery, cheaper technologies and
products, or other factors. It is also possible that, as the coverage increases, reaching the last 20
percent or 10 percent of beneficiaries will be more expensive and have higher marginal cost.
Empirical literature on the over-time changes in the service delivery cost of nutrition interventions
is very limited and it is impossible to determine which of the potential cost escalation or de-
escalation scenarios are more realistic. Given this level of uncertainty, we selected to assume no
changes in service deliver cost.

Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness calculations. Although this analysis compares effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of different interventions, it does not address various different service
modalities options for delivering a specific intervention. Such analysis is beyond the scope of this
report. However, it would be very important for planning the expansion of nutrition interventions
in Zambia. For example, a study by Puett et al. (2013) showed that outpatient treatment of severe
acute malnutrition using ready-to-use therapeutic foods is much more cost-effective than the
traditional inpatient treatment. Further analyses comparing cost-effectiveness of different service
delivery platforms should be conducted.

Different data sources are used to generate costs versus benefits, which may result in an
overstatement of the benefits per dollar spent. Impact analyses using the LiST model use effect
estimates from controlled clinical or community trials. During such trials, the delivery of the
interventions is closely monitored and supervised and, consequently, services delivered are of
very high quality (for example, they exhibit high fidelity with guidelines and protocols, are delivered
by highly trained staff, and so forth). The real-life, large-scale programs are likely to be less
effective than that of controlled trials. Therefore, the results presented above are likely to be


                                                  55
overestimating the cost-effectiveness and economic benefits of the interventions. Nevertheless,
given the absence of more accurate data from large-scale national programs, our estimates can
be interpreted as reasonable upper-bound estimates. On the other hand, the economic benefits
presented, based largely on mortality, morbidity, and cognitive deficits avoided in children under
age five, do not include benefits from reductions in anemia and micronutrient deficiency resulting
from the fortification of staples in the general population. Therefore, it is likely that the benefits
are, in fact, underestimated.

Scope of the analysis. Finally, even though this report focuses almost exclusively on direct
nutrition interventions, the causes of malnutrition are multisectoral, so any longer-term approach
to improving nutrition outcomes must also include nutrition-sensitive interventions. An important
next step will be to extend the cost-effectiveness analysis to nutrition-sensitive interventions
implemented outside of the health sector. More robust data on nutrition-sensitive interventions
are needed to do this.

          PART VI ‚Äì CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Systematic costing of highly effective nutrition interventions is important for priority-setting,
resource mobilization, and advocacy. Combining costing with estimates of impact (in terms of
lives saved, DALYs averted, and cases of stunting averted) and a cost-effectiveness analysis will
make the case for nutrition stronger and will aid in priority-setting by identifying the most cost-
effective packages of interventions in situations where financing is constrained. This will
potentially be a powerful evidence-based advocacy tool for policy makers (i.e., the Ministry of
Finance) when making budget allocations because it provides useful evidence on what the
government can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù (in terms of lives saved, DALYs averted, or cases of stunting averted) given
available resources.

Reaching full national coverage would be expensive and would require a significant increase in
the amount of public resources devoted to nutrition in Zambia. Because it is unlikely that the
government or its partners will find the $40.5 million annually necessary to reach full national
coverage for all nutrition-sensitive interventions, it is important to consider scenarios that make
the most of the resources available. Therefore, the findings and recommendations presented here
are based on cost-benefit analyses that can help policy makers to prioritize the allocation of
resources more effectively so as to achieve maximum impact. The scenario recommended in this
report represents a compromise between the need to increase coverage and the constraints
imposed by limited resources and capacities.

Scaling up the nine most cost-effective interventions (excluding the public provision of
complementary foods) nationwide at either full or partial coverage levels (Scenarios 2 and 4b,
respectively) is the most advantageous way to scale up when considered in terms of resource
requirements and cost-effectiveness (cost per benefit unit). Scenario 4b is the most cost-effective
in terms of cost per DALY averted of $166, and it is also the least costly overall ($11.9 million). It
would avert over 69,000 DALYs and save over 1,600 lives. However, Scenario 4b would only
scale up interventions to partial coverage levels. Scenario 2 requires more resources ($23.7
million) but is also cost-effective ($232 cost per DALY averted) and scales up all nine interventions
to full coverage levels nationwide. Scenario 2 also provides more benefits: over 99,000 DALYs
averted and 2,300 lives saved.

Although this report focuses extensively on nutrition-specific interventions, the causes of
malnutrition are multisectoral and therefore any longer-term approach to improving nutrition
outcomes must also include nutrition-sensitive interventions. This analysis takes an innovative
approach to nutrition costing by not only estimating the costs and benefits of nutrition-specific
interventions but also exploring costs for a selected number of nutrition-sensitive interventions
implemented outside of the health sector. We have identified seven candidate nutrition-sensitive
interventions with high impact potential for Zambia: the biofortication of vitamin A-rich maize and
sweet potato, aflatoxin control in maize, promotion of diet diversity, school-based deworming,
school-based promotion of good hygiene, school-based treatment of bilharzias, and school-based
feeding. The most promising of these is school-based deworming, which is very cost-effective
and requires fewer resources than the other nutrition-sensitive interventions considered here.
However, these interventions are just a starting point, and as the government begins to develop
a multisectoral nutrition policy, it would be useful consult across sectors and ministries in order to
identify other possible nutrition-sensitive interventions that are cost-effective.

Overall, these findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and a candidate
list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a cost-effective approach to reducing the high

                                                 57
levels of child malnutrition in Zambia. Most of the malnutrition that occurs in the first 1,000 days
of a child‚Äôs life is essentially irreversible. Investing in early childhood nutrition interventions
therefore offers a window of opportunity to permanently lock in human capital.

                    APPENDIX 4: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING COSTS FOR ZAMBIA

The following steps lay out the methodology used to estimate costs for each intervention:

1. Describe each intervention
2. Define target populations for each intervention
3. Estimate the size of the target populations for each intervention in each province using the
   most current demographic data
4. Specify the delivery platform or channel(s) for each intervention, based on the country context
   and the accepted delivery modes
5. Identify data on the current coverage levels for each intervention in each province
6. Estimate the unit cost per beneficiary for each intervention from program experience in
   Zambia, whenever possible, and/or Africa region
7. Calculate additional costs of scaling up to full coverage by multiplying the unit cost for each
   intervention with the size of the ‚Äúuncovered‚Äù target population for each intervention by
   province. The formula for calculation is:

         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 = Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ß1 (100 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ß2 )

where:

         x1 = additional costs of scaling up to full coverage
         z1 = unit cost per beneficiary
         z2 = current coverage level (percentage)

8. Estimate additional resources for (1) capacity development for program delivery and (2) M&E,
    operations research, and technical support, estimated at 9 percent and 2 percent of total cost
    of interventions, respectively
9. Estimate a portion of the total cost that can be covered by private household resources. It is
    assumed that households above the poverty line could cover their own cost of iron fortification,
    multiple micronutrient powders, salt iodization. and complementary food from private
    resources
10. Calculate the annual public investment required to scale up these interventions to full
    coverage using the following formula:

         Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å = (Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 + Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 ) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3

   where:

         Y = annual public investment required to scale up to full coverage
         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 = additional total cost to scale up to full coverage
         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3 = cost covered by households living above poverty line for selected interventions


Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except the
treatment of severe acute malnutrition, which is set to 80 percent. This is consistent with World

                                                  64
Bank (2010) methods and is based on the reality that few community-based treatment programs
have successfully achieved more than 80 percent coverage at scale.

               APPENDIX 5: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING DALYS FOR ZAMBIA

The following steps were undertaken to estimate the impact in DALYs averted of implementing
the various nutrition interventions:

   1. Estimate the effectiveness of each intervention on mortality and morbidity for each
      targeted cause
   2. Calculate the rate of YLL and YLD due to each cause-risk factor combination for the target
      population
   3. Calculate the DALYs averted under current or counterfactual coverage scenario
   4. Calculate the DALYs averted under the proposed intervention coverage scenario
   5. Calculate the net DALYs averted by the proposed intervention

1. Estimate the effectiveness of each intervention on mortality and morbidity for each
targeted cause
To estimate the effectiveness of the interventions, key articles by Black et al. (2013) and Bhutta
et al. (2013) in the Lancet series on maternal and child undernutrition were first consulted.
Additional literature searches for the latest evidence were conducted in the Pubmed online
database and the Cochrane Library of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Effectiveness
figures that were reported as statistically significant were extracted and used for the calculations.

2. Calculate the rate of YLL and YLD
The WHO‚Äôs 2012 Global Health Estimates (GHE 2012) data tables provide country-specific YLL
and YLD rates for each cause of death or disease (WHO 2012b). GHE 2012 morbidity and
mortality estimates were used in combination with country-specific population attributable
fractions (PAF) from the Global Burden of Disease (IHME 2010). This assumes that the risk factor
impacts on morbidity and mortality did not differ significantly between the two estimates.

To calculate the rate of morbidity and mortality from a cause due to a specific risk factor, the first
step is to calculate the PAF for the cause-risk factor combination. The PAF was extracted from
the country-specific risk factor attribution table from the 2010 GBD data. This was done separately
for YLL and YLD. In the second step, the country-specific YLLs and YLDs for the target
population‚Äîin most cases children under five years old‚Äîwere extracted from the GHE 2012
estimates. To calculate the YLL rate, the country-specific YLL is multiplied by the YLL PAF and
then by 100,000. The final figure is divided by country-specific population of interest (usually
children under five) to get the rate. The same final steps are followed to calculate the YLD,
although instead multiplying country-specific YLDs by the YLD PAF. The population estimate for
the rate calculation was extracted from GHE 2012.

         YLL per 100,000 = (U-5_cause_total_YLL * YLL_PAF * 100,000)/U-5_ population
         YLD per 100,000 = (U-5_cause_total_YLD * YLD_PAF * 100,000)/U-5_population

where:

         U-5_population = the population of children under five




                                                 66
3. Calculate counterfactual DALYs averted
To calculate the DALYs averted if current intervention coverage were maintained, the following
formula was used:

       YLL = U-5_population_intervention_year * current_coverage
             * intervention_mortality_reduction * YLL_rate

       YLD = U-5_population_intervention_year * current_coverage
              * intervention_morbidity_reduction * YLL_rate

       DALY_current = YLL + YLD

4. Calculate total DALYs averted under intervention coverage
To calculate the potential DALYs averted under the intervention coverage, a similar formula as
above was used:

       YLL = U-5_population_intervention_year * intervention_coverage
             * intervention_mortality_reduction * YLL_rate

       YLD = U-5_population_intervention_year * intervention_coverage
             * intervention_morbidity_reduction * YLL_rate

       DALY_intervention = YLL+YLD

5. Calculate net DALYs averted
The potential net DALYs averted by the intervention is:

       DALYs averted = DALY_intervention - DALY_current




                                               67

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is a part of an integrated set of tools that comprise the Spectrum
policy modeling system. These tools include DemProj for creating demographic projections; AIM
to model and incorporate the impact of HIV/AIDS on demographic projections and child survival
interventions; and FamPlan for incorporating changing fertility into the demographic projection.
LiST is used to project how increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal
survival. The table below summarizes data sources used for the Zambia LiST estimates.

Once the demographic and health data have been updated, the coverage and scale-up plan for
each intervention is introduced into LiST. LiST either can use a sequential method to calculate
the impact of individual interventions or can calculate the simultaneous impact of a set of
interventions implemented at the same time. The second, simultaneous method is likely to yield
slightly lower estimates because interventions may have overlapping benefits. In this analysis we
present the both the individual/sequential results of the individual interventions in the full coverage

scenario (with totals calculated using the simultaneous method) and the simultaneous impact in
the various scale-up scenarios.

Note on Estimates of Cases of Stunting Averted
In order to estimate the number of cases of under-five stunting averted attributable to the annual
investment in the scaling up of nutrition interventions, we use LiST to model changes in the
prevalence of stunting over five years, during which the interventions are projected to have
reached 100 percent of the target population. Next, we model changes in the prevalence of
stunting over five years with no scale-up of the interventions. We then take the difference between
the estimated stunting prevalence in Year 5 with the scale up and the prevalence in Year 5 absent
the scale-up, and multiply this percentage point difference by the total population of children under
five years of age.

Our reason for using stunting prevalence in Year 5 relates to the assumptions built into the LiST
model, which assumes that stunting is itself a risk factor for becoming stunted in the next time
period. As a result, stunting prevalence remains flat during the first two years of the scale-up,
before dropping precipitously until Year 5, after which the prevalence begins to level out. We
assume that continuing investments in maintaining scale after Year 5 will serve to maintain the
gains in stunting prevalence reduction, and therefore we present this reduction as a benefit
attributable to a one-year investment in scaling up nutrition.

On the other hand, when estimating stunting reduction (and lives saved) attributable to a five-
year scale-up plan, we model this scale-up directly in LiST and use the annual results over five
years in our cost-benefit analysis. Using annual results over five years provides a more accurate
portrayal of the direct benefits attributable to a five-year scale up plan, and it does not assume
that the scale will necessarily be maintained following the end of the period covered in the plan.

                  APPENDIX 7: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING ECONOMIC BENEFITS

There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the best methodology for monetizing the
value of a life saved. In this analysis, we focus solely on the economic value of a life year, which
we measure as equal to GNI per capita. Other studies attempt to estimate the social value of a
life year as well as its economic value; because we do not, we acknowledge that our results
underestimate the true value of a life year saved.

Still, valuing years of life saved alone does not account for the economic benefits of reduced
morbidity, which include the long-term, nonlethal impacts of malnutrition on individuals. Although
there are a number of long-term impacts of nutritional deficiencies, we choose to focus on stunting
because of the availability of country-specific impact estimates produced by the LiST tool. 13

In order to estimate the economic value of a case of childhood stunting averted, we follow the
methodology used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), who begin by assuming that stunted individuals lose
an average of 66 percent of lifetime earnings, based on direct estimates of the impact of stunting
in early life on later life outcomes found in Hoddinott et al. (2011). 14 This estimate for the effects
of stunting on future consumption is used as a proxy for the effect of stunting on lifetime earnings.
Additionally, Hoddinott et al. (2013) account for uncertainty by assuming that only 90 percent of
the total gains will be realized, which we also include in our calculations. However, unlike those
authors, we adjust our calculations to reflect the country‚Äôs labor force participation rate.

For both lives saved and cases of stunting averted, the benefits of a five-year scale-up plan are
attributed to a group of children that is assumed to enter the labor force at age 15 and exit the
labor force at age 57, which is equivalent to life expectancy at birth in Zambia. Benefits from both
stunting and lives saved are then multiplied by a lifetime discount factor (LDF) in order to obtain
the present value of benefits incurred during the expected years of productivity (years between
the age of entry into and exit from the workforce). The LDF is derived from three potential discount
rates (3 percent, 5 percent, and 7 percent), an adjustment for age at the time of investment (for
simplicity, we assume an average age of two years for all children), and the years of lifetime
productivity expected. The LDF represents the years of productivity that are ‚Äúcounted‚Äù in the
calculation, discounted back to their present value in the year in which the investment in nutrition
is made. Because we assume an average age of two years for all beneficiaries, we use an LDF
that assumes that these children will enter the labor force 13 years from the time of investment.
Importantly, given the time frame considered under this analysis, we do not attempt to account
for projected growth in the country‚Äôs GDP and per capita incomes. This downward bias contributes
to the conservative nature of our estimates.

The following equations are used to estimate (1) the economic value of lives saved (reduced
mortality) and (2) increased future productivity (reduced morbidity):



13   It should be noted that because stunting is just one of many long-term consequences of poor nutrition,
         actual economic benefits of improving nutrition may be much higher than estimated here.
14   Hoddinott et al. (2011) provided direct estimates of the impact of stunting in early life on later life
       outcomes, which found that an individual stunted at age 36 months had, on average, 66 percent
       lower per capita consumption over his or her productive life.

where:

   ‚Ä¢     Lives saved attributable to the intervention scale-up are estimated using the LiST tool.
   ‚Ä¢     Cases of child stunting averted are calculated by subtracting the projected under-five
         stunting prevalence (%) after the interventions are scaled up calculated by LiST from the
         projected stunting prevalence under a scenario with no scale up and multiplying it by the
         total under-five population.
   ‚Ä¢     The coefficient of deficit is equal to the reduction in lifetime earnings attributable to
         stunting.
   ‚Ä¢     The lifetime discount factor (LDF) is used to discount future benefits to their value at the
         time of investment. It is derived from a discount rate, age at the time of investment and
         the estimated age of entry and exit into the workforce. The equation used to calculate the
         LDF is:

         LDF = the lifetime discount factor
            r = is the discount rate
            t = the time period since the initial investment in scaling up the interventions (we
            assume that children are 2 years old at the time of investment and enter the labor force
            at 15 years old, which is reflected in the starting value for t)
            T = the last time period before individuals exit the labor force (we assume individuals
            are out of the workforce at life expectancy at birth)


Note, the beginning time period t and ending period T is adjusted for each cohort based on the
year of investment. For example, the first cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time period
t=13 and exit at time T, the second cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time period t=14
and exit at time T+1, and so forth.

Finally, the annual addition to economic productivity is measured by taking the total economic
benefits for the year in which all beneficiaries of the initial one-year investment have reached
productive age. These benefits are not discounted back to their present value, as they are
considered the annual opportunity cost of not investing in scaling up nutrition interventions. It
should be noted that these benefits are derived from a progressive, five-year scale-up plan, and
therefore subsequent investments that maintain the target scale will increase the total annual
benefits as new beneficiaries are reached.

This paper builds on global experience and Zambia‚Äôs specific context to identify an effective nutrition approach
along with costs and benefits of key nutrition interventions. It is intended to help guide the selection of the most
cost-effective interventions as well as strategies for scaling these up. The paper considers both relevant
‚Äúnutrition-specific‚Äù interventions, largely delivered through the health sector, and multisectoral ‚Äúnutrition-
sensitive‚Äù interventions, delivered through other sectors such as agriculture, education, and water and sanitation.
We estimate that the costs and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions would require an
annual public investment of $40.5 million and would avert over 112,000 DALYs, save over 2,800 lives, and
prevent 62,000 cases of stunting. Economic productivity could potentially increase by $915 million annually over
the productive lives of the beneficiaries, with an impressive internal rate of return of 32 percent. However,
because it is unlikely that the Government of the Zambia or its partners will find the $40.5 million necessary each
year to reach full coverage, we also consider scale-up scenarios based on considerations of their potential for
impact, burden of stunting, resource requirements, and implementation capacity. The two scenarios that scale
up the nine most cost-effective nutrition-specific interventions (excluding the public provision of complementary
foods) are the most advantageous in terms of cost-effectiveness and resource requirements and would require
$11 million to scale up to partial levels and $23 to scale up to full-coverage levels. Among the 8 nutrition-specific
interventions we consider, school-based deworming is low cost and effective. The interventions we reviewed in
the agriculture sector are expensive when compared to nutrition-specific interventions, although very little cost-
effectiveness data are available for the nutrition-sensitive interventions to make careful comparisons. These
findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and a candidate list of nutrition-sensitive
approaches that represent a highly cost-effective approach to reducing child malnutrition in Zambia.

Abstract: This paper builds on global experience and Guinea-Bissau‚Äôs specific context to identify an
effective nutrition approach along with costs and benefits of key nutrition interventions. It is intended to help
guide the selection of the most cost-effective interventions as well as strategies for scaling these up. We
estimate that the costs and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions in all regions of
Guinea-Bissau would require a public investment of USD 17 million over five years (with about USD 3
million needed to maintain the current coverage of the interventions and USD 14 million needed to expand
the coverage to reach 90 percent of the population). The two key conclusions of this paper are, first, that
investing in nutrition in Guinea-Bissau is cost-effective based on international standards and, second, that
investments in nutrition can generate very substantial health and economic benefits, with one dollar spent
on nutrition interventions resulting in about 10 dollars of returns over the productive lives of children covered
by high-impact nutrition interventions. Economic productivity could potentially increase by USD 120 million
(discounted at 3 percent) over the productive lives of the beneficiaries, with an impressive internal rate of
return of 9 percent annually. These findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions that
represent a highly cost-effective approach to reducing child malnutrition and stunting in Guinea-Bissau.

Keywords: nutrition-specific interventions, cost-effectiveness, benefit-cost analysis, nutrition financing,
Guinea-Bissau.

A benefit-cost ratio summarizes the overall value of a project or proposal. It is the ratio of the benefits of
a project or proposal, expressed in monetary terms, relative to its costs, also expressed in monetary terms.
The benefit-cost ratio takes into account the amount of monetary gain realized by implementing a project
versus the amount it costs to execute the project. The higher the ratio, the better the investment. A general
rule is that if the benefit from a project is greater than its cost, the project is a good investment.

Capacity development for program delivery is a process that involves increasing in-country human
capacity and systems to design, deliver, manage, and evaluate large-scale interventions (Horton et al.
2010). This includes developing skills by training public health personnel and community volunteers to
improve the delivery of services. These efforts typically accompany program implementation or, when
possible, precede program implementation. In this analysis 9 percent of total programmatic costs is
allocated to capacity development for program delivery.

Cost-benefit analysis is an approach to economic analysis that weighs the cost of an intervention against
its benefits. The approach involves assigning a monetary value to the benefits of an intervention and
estimating the expected present value of the net benefits, known as the net present value. Net benefits are
the difference between the cost and monetary value of benefits of the intervention. The net present value
is defined mathematically as:
                                             Ì†µÌ±á
                                                      Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±°
         Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±í = ‚àë                 ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞∂0
                                                   (1 + Ì†µÌ±ü)Ì†µÌ±°
                                            Ì†µÌ±°=1


where Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±° is net cash inflows, Ì†µÌ∞∂0 is the initial investment, the index Ì†µÌ±° is the time period, and Ì†µÌ±ü is the discount
rate. A positive net present value, when discounted at appropriate rates, indicates that the present value of
cash inflows (benefits) exceeds the present value of cash outflows (cost of financing). Interventions with
net present values that are at least as high as alternative interventions provide greater benefits than
interventions with net present values equal to or lower than alternatives. The results of cost-benefit analysis
can also be expressed in terms of the benefit-cost ratio.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is an approach to economic analysis that is intended to identify interventions
that produce the desired results at the lowest cost. Cost-effectiveness analysis requires two components:
the total cost of the intervention and an estimate of the intervention‚Äôs impact, such as the number of lives
saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio can be defined as:

                                                                        Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ô Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ì Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±î Ì†µÌ±°‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±õ

                                                                    Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ì Ì†µÌ±°‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±õ Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±õ Ì†µÌ±é Ì†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ê Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±í

The analysis involves comparing the cost-effectiveness ratios among alternative interventions with the
same outcomes. The intervention with the lowest cost per benefit is considered to be the most cost-effective
intervention among the alternatives.

A DALY is a disability-adjusted life year, which is equivalent to a year of healthy life lost due to a health
condition. The DALY, developed in 1993 by the World Bank, combines the years of life lost from a disease
(YLL) and the years of life spent with disability from the disease (YLD). DALYs count the gains from both
mortality (how many more years of life lost due to premature death are prevented) and morbidity (how many
years or parts of years of life lost due to disability are prevented). An advantage of the DALY is that it is a
metric that is recognized and understood by external audiences such as the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It helps to gauge the contribution of individual diseases
relative to the overall burden of disease by geographic region or health area. Combined with cost data,
DALYs allow for estimating and comparing the cost-effectiveness of scaling up nutrition interventions in
different countries.



                                                                                    viii
A discount rate refers to a rate of interest used to determine the current value of future cash flows. The
concept of the time value of money suggests that income earned in the present is worth more than the
same amount of income earned in the future because of its earning potential. A higher discount rate reflects
higher losses to potential benefits from alternative investments in capital. A higher discount rate may also
reflect a greater risk premium of the intervention.

The internal rate of return is the discount rate that produces a net present value of cash flows equal to
zero. An intervention has a non-negative net present value when the internal rate of return equals or
exceeds the appropriate discount rate. Interventions yielding higher internal rates of return than alternatives
tend to be considered more desirable than the alternatives.

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is an estimation tool that translates measured coverage changes into
estimates of mortality reduction and cases of childhood stunting averted. LiST is used to project how
increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal survival. It is part of an integrated set of
tools that comprise the Spectrum policy modeling system.

Nutrition-sensitive interventions ‚Äúaddress the underlying and basic determinants of maternal, fetal, and
child nutrition and development, including food security; adequate caregiving resources at the maternal,
household and community levels; and access to health services and a safe and hygienic environment, and
incorporate specific nutrition goals and actions. Nutrition-sensitive programs can serve as delivery platforms
for nutrition-specific interventions, potentially increasing their scale, coverage, and effectiveness. Examples
include programs for agriculture and food security; SSNs [social safety nets]; early childhood development;
maternal mental health; women‚Äôs empowerment; child protection; schooling; WASH [water, sanitation and
hygiene]; and health and family planning services‚Äù (Bhutta et al. 2013).

Nutrition-specific interventions ‚Äúhave an immediate and direct impact on maternal, fetal, and child
nutrition and development, including adequate food and nutrient intake, feeding, caregiving and parenting
practices, and low burden of infectious diseases. Examples include adolescent, preconception, and
maternal health and nutrition; maternal dietary or micronutrient supplementation; promotion of optimum
breastfeeding; complementary feeding and responsive feeding practices and stimulation; dietary
supplementation; diversification and micronutrient supplementation or fortification for children; treatment of
SAM [severe acute malnutrition]; disease prevention and management; and nutrition in emergencies‚Äù
(Bhutta et al. 2013).

Sensitivity analysis is a technique that evaluates the robustness of findings when key variables change.
It helps to identify the variables with the greatest and least influence on the outcomes of the intervention,
and it may involve adjusting the values of a variable to observe the impact of the variable on the outcome.

Stunting (chronic malnutrition) is low height-for-age, defined as more than 2 standard deviations below the
mean of the sex-specific reference data. Stunting is the cumulative effect of long-term deficits in food intake,
poor caring practices, and illness.

Unit Cost is the cost of all inputs divided per unit of output (person treated, group sensitized, report
produced, and so on) in one given intervention.

Wasting (acute malnutrition) is low weight-for-height, defined as more than 2 standard deviations below
the mean of the sex-specific reference data. Wasting is usually the result of a recent shock, such as lack
of calories and nutrients or illness, and is strongly linked to mortality.

A Z-score is a metric describing deviations from a reference value (usually the mean of a distribution). It is
calculated with the following formula:

                          (Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ë Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±í) ‚àí (Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±õ Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±¢Ì†µÌ±í)

                                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The overall objective of this report is to support the Government of Guinea-Bissau in developing a costed
scale-up plan for nutrition. It builds on the existing interventions outlined in the National Nutrition Policy
(Pol√≠tica Nacional de Nutri√ß√£o) and the national Nutrition Strategic Plan (Plano Estrat√©gico de Nutri√ß√£o, or
PEN) to provide a costing analysis for implementing high-impact interventions over five years and to serve
as an input into a national roadmap for improving maternal and child nutrition and health outcomes. This
executive summary is written for policy makers; it highlights the study‚Äôs main findings and discusses their
implications for the Government of Guinea-Bissau and its partners. The paper itself is more technical in
nature and is written for planners and programmers. The analyses presented below are intended to bring
evidence of potential impact and allocative efficiency into nutrition programming in Guinea-Bissau.

Guinea-Bissau has faced years of political instability coupled with extreme poverty and a rising disease
burden. As a result, the country is ranked 178th out of 188 countries in the 2015 UNDP Human
Development Index. Although the country‚Äôs stunting prevalence (chronic malnutrition) has dropped
progressively over the past several years (from 40.9 percent in 2006 to 27.6 percent in 2014), more than a
quarter of all children in Guinea-Bissau remain stunted. Furthermore, striking regional variations in stunting
rates warrant a consideration of the need to scale up high-impact interventions. Stunting rates are highest
in the Bafat√° and Oio regions. Bolama, Bijag√≥s, and Bissau experience the lowest stunting rates, likely as
a result of less severe food insecurity in these areas (WFP 2016). Even in the wealthiest quintile, almost
one fifth (18.8 percent) of children are stunted, indicating a need to drastically improve nutrition status for
all populations.

Malnutrition, particularly in very young children, leads to increased mortality rates, increased risk illness,
and negative long-term effects on cognitive abilities. These result in irreversible losses to human capital
and contribute to losses in economic productivity. Undernutrition is an underlying cause of about one-half
of under-five child mortality and one-fifth of maternal mortality in developing countries. Children who have
been malnourished early in life are more likely to experience cognitive deficiencies and poor schooling
outcomes. In the longer term, stunting results in a loss of as much as 20 percent of wages earned over a
lifetime. Furthermore, because chronic malnutrition increases the risk of child illnesses, in the short term it
increases households‚Äô expenditure on health.

At the same time, interventions aimed at improving nutrition in pregnant women and children under the age
of five are consistently identified as being among the most cost-effective development actions, with a
significant potential to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity. It is estimated that investing in nutrition
can increase a country‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) by 4 to 11 percent annually in Africa and Asia.
Investments in early nutrition lock in human capital for life and help drive future productivity and growth.
Evidence shows that these early investments in nutrition have the potential to boost wages, supercharge
the demographic dividend, make children 33 percent more likely to escape poverty in the future, and help
reduce gender inequities.

The report uses the costing framework developed and presented in Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost?
(Horton et al. 2010) as a starting point, and applies this framework to the country-specific context of Guinea-
Bissau. This report estimates the cost of scaling up 10 high-impact interventions in Guinea-Bissau: (1) iron
and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy, (2) vitamin A supplementation for children, (3) deworming
for children, (4) breastfeeding counseling and (5) complementary feeding education, (6) treatment of severe
acute malnutrition with complications, (7) treatment of severe acute malnutrition without complications, (8)
management of moderate acute malnutrition, (9) therapeutic zinc supplementation for the treatment of
diarrhea; and (10) salt iodization. These interventions were selected because they have been shown to
have high impact on the nutrition and health status of children under five (Bhutta et al. 2013) and because
they are included in the country‚Äôs key national strategic documents, namely PEN.

Cost-effectiveness analyses were limited to the following interventions: breastfeeding counseling,
complementary feeding education, treatment of severe acute malnutrition (both complicated and
uncomplicated), and management of moderate acute malnutrition; and therapeutic zinc supplementation


                                                      xi
for the treatment of diarrhea. Vitamin A supplementation and deworming were excluded from the cost-
effectiveness analyses because coverage is already at 90 percent for both interventions, so no scale-up
was projected. Additionally, the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) does not include the impact of salt iodization
(because iodization affects cognitive development rather than morbidity or mortality) or iron and folic acid
supplementation in pregnancy (because these interventions affect maternal morbidity, but not child
morbidity or mortality).

The total cost of implementing these high-impact nutrition interventions over the next five years, the timeline
envisioned in the draft PEN, is USD 17 million. The cost includes about USD 3 million to maintain the
interventions at the current coverage level and an additional USD 14 million to scale them up to 90 percent.
This scale-up of the interventions would prevent over 2,400 child deaths and 4,300 cases of stunting.
Those investments are further estimated to translate into economic benefits of about USD 120 million over
the productive lives of children who receive the interventions. The resulting benefit-cost ratio of 9.8 suggests
that every dollar invested would result in about 10 dollars in economic returns.

The two key conclusions of this report are, first, that investing in nutrition in Guinea-Bissau is cost-effective
based on international standards and, second, that investments in nutrition can generate very substantial
health and economic benefits, with one dollar spent on nutrition interventions resulting in about 10 dollars
of returns over the productive lives of children covered by high-impact nutrition interventions.

The analyses show that the total costs over five years of implementing 10 high-impact nutrition-specific
interventions in Guinea-Bissau are estimated to be about USD 17 million. About USD 3 million is needed
to continue the current coverage of the interventions and a further USD 14 million is required to finance the
scale-up of interventions. Estimates show very large benefits from investing in this scale-up: over 2,400
child deaths and 4,300 cases of stunting would be averted. Investing in life-saving measures would give
each child in Guinea-Bissau more years of good health and productivity and contribution to the country‚Äôs
growth and prosperity. Indeed, the estimates suggest increases in economic productivity of about USD 120
million over the productive lives of the children who benefit from the interventions.

The treatments of severe and moderate acute malnutrition and breastfeeding counseling are the most cost-
effective interventions in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), even though they have relatively
high unit costs. Complementary feeding education‚Äîpart of the infant and young child feeding package‚Äî

                                    PART I ‚Äì BACKGROUND

                                     OBJECTIVES AND STUDY RATIONALE

In 2015 the Government of Guinea-Bissau requested technical assistance from the World Bank in
estimating the cost of implementing the national Strategic Nutrition Plan (Plano Estrat√©gico de Nutri√ß√£o, or
PEN) 2015‚Äì2019. PEN was defined and validated using a participatory and inclusive approach involving
various stakeholders working in nutrition in the country. It provides a policy framework for the
implementation of multisectoral nutrition actions in the country. The ultimate objective of PEN 2015‚Äì2019
is to ensure the implementation, extension, and synergy of the nutrition interventions and sectors sensitive
to nutrition in order to improve population‚Äôs nutrition status. PEN targets for 2019 are:

   ÔÇ∑    Reduce the prevalence of malnutrition in the population by 15 percent.
   ÔÇ∑    Reduce the prevalence of over-nutrition in the population by 15 percent.
   ÔÇ∑    Increase the level of household food security by 30 percent.
   ÔÇ∑    Improve the intersectoral coordination of nutrition actions.
   ÔÇ∑    Reduce the prevalence of stunting, acute malnutrition, and underweight in children 6‚Äì59 months of
        age by 15 percent.
   ÔÇ∑    Reduce the prevalence of anemia in children 0‚Äì23 months of age by 15 percent.
   ÔÇ∑    Reduce the prevalence of malnutrition among mothers by 15 percent.
   ÔÇ∑    Reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity among mothers by 15 percent.
   ÔÇ∑    Reduce the prevalence of anemia in mothers by 15 percent.
   ÔÇ∑    Improve the surveillance system to collect and monitor nutrition actions regularly.

This report presents analyses conducted as part of the technical assistance provided by the World Bank. It
focuses on a package of high-impact, evidence-based, nutrition-specific interventions. It consists of four
parts. The first part presents background and an overview of nutritional status of the population of Guinea-
Bissau, with a focus on pregnant women and children under age five. The second part describes the
methodology used, including details about the assumptions used to develop unit cost (cost per beneficiary)
that will be used by the Government of Guinea-Bissau as the basis for estimating the cost of PEN‚Äôs
implementation. The third part presents an analysis of the costs, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of a set
of key nutrition-specific interventions included in PEN. The last part of the report summarizes the main
conclusions and policy implications. The goal of the analyses is to contribute to the building of an investment
case for nutrition in Guinea-Bissau and to inform the prioritization within PEN by identifying which
interventions are the most cost-effective (that is, which interventions offer the lowest cost per death or case
of stunting averted) and in which geographic regions investments in nutrition-specific action have the
potential to have the greatest impacts.

                                             COUNTRY CONTEXT

One of the poorest and most fragile countries in the world, Guinea-Bissau has faced continuous political
instability and a lack of stable social and economic institutions for more than two decades. There are an
estimated 1.7 million inhabitants, with approximately 50 percent of the population under 18 years of age
and 16 percent under age five. In 2014, Guinea-Bissau had a gross national income (GNI) per capita of
USD 550 with 70 percent of the population living in poverty (USD PPP 2 per day); with about 33 percent in
extreme poverty (USD PPP 1 per day), marking a significant increase from 21 percent in 2002 (World Bank
2015). Guinea-Bissau ranked 178 out of 188 countries in the 2015 UNDP Human Development Index (HDI),
falling below the average for countries in the low ranks of the HDI and below the average for countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Between 2005 and 2014, Guinea-Bissau‚Äôs HDI value increased by 6.8 percent‚Äîan
average annual increase of about 0.73 percent. The 2006 Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) estimates
that health accounts for close to 30 percent of overall poverty deprivation in the country (UNDP 2015).

All regions of Guinea-Bissau have high rates of poverty, with extreme poverty concentrated in the north
(see Figure 1). The poverty index, shown in the legend of Figure 1, as a range from the darkest shaded

                                                      1
area with a poverty rate of 0.5 to 0.6, or 50 to 60 percent of the population, to the lightest shaded box at a
poverty rate of 0.1 to 0.2, or 10 to 20 percent of the population. The poverty index is somewhat lower in the
capital, Bissau (0.1 to 0.2) than in the other eight regions of the country, with about 50 percent of residents
getting by on less than USD 1 per day. Fifty-six percent of the population lives in rural areas, largely
concentrated in the north of the country (World Bank 2015).

Note: The poverty indexes range from 0.5 to 0.6 in the darkest box (indicating 50 to 60% of the population
living on less than USD 1/day) to 0.1 to 0.2 in the lightest box (indicating 10 to 20% of the population living
on less than USD 1/day).


Although total health expenditure in Guinea-Bissau continues to grow, the government health expenditure
as a percentage of general government expenditure remains relatively low at 7.8 percent (WHO 2016) and
per capita health expenditure remains below USD 35, which is estimated by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as the minimum amount needed to cover essential health services (UNICEF 2015). Nearly 80
percent of health care is financed from private sources. Out-of-pocket expenditures are among the highest
in the West Africa region and account for over 60 percent of total private health expenditure. This leads to
increased household burden on accessing health care and increased risk of impoverishing or catastrophic
health expenditure.

Maternal and child mortality rates are falling, but many health challenges persist. The infant mortality rate
reported in the 2010 and 2014 Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) has decreased from 63 to 55 per
1,000 live births and the under-five mortality rate from 116 to 89 per 1,000 live births (MICS 2010, 2014).
Despite this progress, Guinea-Bissau has one of the highest under-five mortality rates in the world (UNICEF
2013). The main causes of childhood deaths in Guinea-Bissau are diseases that are easily preventable,
including malaria, acute respiratory infections, and diarrhea. Similarly, maternal mortality rates have
declined on average 2.5 percent per year since 1990 (Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group no
date), but still ranks 13th among the 15 countries in the world with the worst maternal mortality rate (all

these countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa) (World Bank 2013) and among the 11 bottom-ranked countries
for the health and well-being of mothers and children (Save the Children 2015).

                       POVERTY, HEALTH AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS IN GUINEA-BISSAU

Poverty and malnutrition in Guinea-Bissau are compounded by chronic food insecurity. Rice is the main
staple food, and many Guinea-Bissau families struggle to complement their diet with other more nutritious
foods. Food security is further impacted by irregular rainfall, volatile prices of imported rice, and an economy
based on an undiversified local cashew nut production; in 2012 and 2013 donors intervened with food aid
because many families could not muster the resources to buy rice (World Bank 2015). The Guinea-Bissau
Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System data showed that, overall, 11 percent of the households
were food insecure in 2015. However, this figure varies across regions: in some areas, up to 51 percent of
families are affected (WFP 2016).

Inequalities in child undernutrition across wealth quintiles are pronounced in Guinea-Bissau. The high levels
of poverty translate into poor nutrition. Stunting rates in the poorest households (40.6 percent) are more
than twice those in the richest households (17.8 percent) (Figure 2). However, although stunting rates are
nearly uniformly high across the three lowest wealth quintiles, even in the wealthiest households nearly
one-fifth of the children are stunted. This indicates that, while stunting is associated with poverty, other
factors also put children at risk of chronic malnutrition. These include the high prevalence and incidence of
disease, in particular diarrhea, as well as inappropriate feeding and caregiving practices. This suggests a
need to design different strategies to address undernutrition among the poorest from the strategies used
among the non-poor.

Stunting prevalence in Guinea-Bissau has seen steady improvements over the past decade. The
percentage of children who are stunted (< ‚àí2 standard deviations in height-for-age) was estimated at 27.6
percent in 2014, which is a drop from the estimates of 2010 and 2006 (see Figure 3) (MICS 2006, 2010,
2014). The prevalence of stunting in Guinea-Bissau is well below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (40
percent) and below the average among many of its income peers (UNData 2013) in West and Central
Africa. Nevertheless, some countries with lower per capita incomes, such as The Gambia, exhibit similar
rates of child stunting, which shows that it is possible to achieve better nutrition outcomes despite low
income (see Figure 4).

The national prevalence of stunting at 27.6 percent masks dramatic geographical disparities within the
country (MICS 2014). Figure 5 shows disparities across regions. The Oio region, for example, has a stunting
prevalence above 35 percent, whereas in the Bijag√≥s region the stunting prevalence is much lower‚Äî14
percent (MICS 2014). On average, the regions in the south have fewer cases of stunting than the northern
and eastern regions.

In Guinea-Bissau, approximately half of all children are exclusively breastfed until six months of age (MICS
2014). However, regional percentages of exclusive breastfeeding vary greatly as well. Bafat√° and Tombali
show lower than national average rates of exclusive breastfeeding, while Oio, Bolama/Bijag√≥s, and Cacheu
show markedly higher rates (see Figure 6). Given the data on regional variations, it may be pertinent to
target breastfeeding counseling interventions to areas with the lowest rates, as well as learn from areas
with higher rates on successful approaches.

Following the six month period of exclusive breastfeeding, it is recommended that infants gradually begin
taking nutritious complementary foods in semi-solid form, followed by solid foods. Between 6 and 24
months, it is critical that children receive a diverse range of foods from four or more food groups, three to
five times per day, in adequate age-appropriate amounts (UNICEF 2011). Achieving this minimum
acceptable diet is difficult for many families in Guinea-Bissau, where food insecurity impacts as much as
half of the population in some regions. Overall, only 8 percent of all children in Guinea-Bissau receive a
minimum acceptable diet, but with wide ranges across regions. For example, 28 percent of children in
Bolama/Bijag√≥s receive a minimum acceptable diet, but only 3 and 3.7 percent of children in Gabu and
Cacheu, respectively, receive a minimum acceptable diet.

        Note: Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as an infant receiving only mother‚Äôs breastmilk and no
        other foods, liquids, or even water. Global recommendations are for mothers to exclusively
        breastfeed for the first six months of life for best infant outcomes.

Guinea-Bissau has made great strides in reducing vitamin A deficiency over the past decade. Severe and
prolonged vitamin A deficiency increases child mortality, increases vulnerability to infectious diseases such
as measles, and leads to blindness among children under five. It is estimated that nearly all children under
five in Guinea-Bissau received two high-potency doses of vitamin A supplements in 2014 (UNICEF 2016).
Current coverage rates are a strong improvement from the WHO‚Äôs 1995‚Äì2005 estimates that found nearly
55 percent of preschool-age children and 18 percent of pregnant women in Guinea-Bissau had vitamin A
deficiency‚Äîprevalence rates that were higher than the regional averages (WHO 2009). This is a significant
public health achievement: twice-annual doses of vitamin A supplementation have shown to reduce the risk
of death in children age 6‚Äì59 months by about 23‚Äì30 percent (Beaton et al. 1993; Fawzi et al. 1993;
Glasziou and Mackerras 1993).

Micronutrient deficiencies (hidden hunger) are pervasive in Guinea-Bissau. Collectively, micronutrient
deficiencies alone add up to an estimated loss of over USD 6 million in GDP every year (Horton et al. 2010).
The most recent data available reveal that the prevalence of anemia among preschool-age children and
pregnant women is a severe public health concern. The WHO estimates that 71 percent of preschool-age
children and 49 percent of pregnant women in Guinea-Bissau are anemic, with approximately half of all
anemia caused by inadequate dietary intake of iron, and the rest due to infections and parasites (WHO
2015). The national averages in Guinea-Bissau are comparable to the regional estimates for Central and
West Africa: 71 percent prevalence among preschool-age children and 56 percent prevalence among
pregnant women (Stevens et al. 2013). Micronutrient deficiencies are further compounded because fewer
than one in twelve households consume adequately iodized salt, leaving children in the vast majority of
households unprotected from iodine deficiency disorders (MICS 2014). Adequate intake of iodine is critical
for cognitive development and successful pregnancy outcomes. Significant effort is needed to meet the
Universal Salt Iodization goal of 90% of households consuming appropriately iodized salt.

Approximately 15 percent of post-neonatal deaths and 1 percent of neonatal deaths in Guinea-Bissau in
2013 were attributed to diarrheal disease (WHO no date). Nearly 90 percent of these deaths are directly


                                                              8
attributed to poor water, sanitation and hygiene (Pr√ºss-√úst√ºn et al. 2008). Although all undernourished
children are at higher risk of death, a child who is severely stunted is 4.6 times more likely to die of diarrhea
than a child who is not stunted (Black et al. 2008). An estimated 55 percent of children under five who
experience diarrheal diseases receive oral rehydration treatment with continued feeding in Guinea-Bissau
(MICS 2014). This coverage is higher than the regional average of 30 percent (UNICEF 2012). Despite this,
diarrheal diseases were estimated to be the fourth leading cause of premature death in Guinea-Bissau
(IHME 2013). Diarrheal episodes also impact morbidity. The disease exacerbates the relationship between
malnutrition and infection: as children with diarrheal diseases tend to eat less, absorb fewer nutrients, and
exhibit reduced resistance to infections. Prolonged diarrheal episodes lead to impaired growth and
development (Ejemot et al. 2008). At the same time, undernutrition is also a consequence of repeated bouts
of illness, diarrhea in particular. Poor sanitation is also a contributing factor‚Äîthrough its impact on
malnutrition rates‚Äîto other leading causes of child mortality, including malaria, acute respiratory infections,
and measles. In addition to oral rehydration solution, it is currently recommended to treat cases of diarrhea
with a 10 to 14 day course of therapeutic zinc. Therapeutic zinc supplements have been shown to reduce
the duration and severity of diarrheal illness, as well as the likelihood of subsequent infections for two to
three months (Khan and Sellen 2011).

              NATIONAL AND PARTNER EFFORTS TO ADDRESS M ALNUTRITION IN GUINEA-BISSAU

Following a movement in 2013 to coordinate partners working in food security and nutrition, the Government
of Guinea-Bissau became the 49th member of the Scale-Up Nutrition (SUN) movement in March 2014
(Scaling Up Nutrition 2015). During this time, Guinea-Bissau also adopted a National Nutrition Policy (MoPH
No date), which outlines priority strategies for improving nutrition status. The policy identifies key targets to
be reached by 2025, including a reduction in stunting, acute malnutrition, anemia in children and women of
reproductive age, vitamin A deficiencies, and iodine deficiencies. The National Nutrition Policy also calls for
greater integration and partnership efforts to improve nutrition programs. The Ministry of Health has forged
many partnerships with stakeholders, including UN agencies (UNICEF, the International Fund for
Agricultural Development, the UN Population Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the World
Food Program), civil society organizations (CARITAS, Catholic Relief Services, and others), and other
development partners (the European Union and the World Bank). The government and partners are
currently working on developing a national Nutrition Strategic Plan (Plano Estrategico de Nutri√ß√£o, or PEN)
to operationalize the national policy and propose a prioritized intervention package and a set of supportive
actions to achieve the targets outlined in the national policy.

The analysis includes 10 interventions that comprise a modified package of the interventions included in
the 2013 Lancet series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition, tailored to the Guinea-Bissau context. These
interventions are based on current scientific evidence, and there is general consensus from the global
community about their impact. The interventions are also included in the current draft of the national
Strategic Nutrition Plan (Plano Estrat√©gico de Nutri√ß√£o, or PEN). The interventions and the associated
target population are specified in Table 1. The following section provides further details on the mechanisms
for delivery and costing methods for each intervention.

                                           ESTIMATING UNIT COSTS

The program experience costing approach employed in the Scaling Up Nutrition report (Horton et al. 2010)
is used for calculating the cost of scaling up in Guinea-Bissau.1 This approach generates unit cost data
(cost per person covered) that capture all aspects of service delivery‚Äîincluding the costs of commodities,
transportation and storage, personnel, training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), relevant
overhead, wastage, and so on‚Äîfor each intervention from actual programs that are already in operation in
Guinea-Bissau, and considers the context in which they are delivered.

Another commonly used method is the ingredients approach, in which selected activities are bundled into
appropriate delivery packages (such as the number of visits to a health center; see Bhutta et al. 2013, for
example). Although the program experience approach tends to yield cost estimates that are higher than
those of the ingredients approach, the estimates more accurately reflect real programmatic experience,
including inefficiencies in service delivery. It should be noted, however, that the calculated costs are
reported in financial or budgetary terms. They do not capture the full social resource requirements, which
account for the opportunity costs of the time committed by beneficiaries accessing the services. In this
report, the program experience approach was used for programs where budgets for specific interventions
were available and the cost for specific interventions could be isolated from the overall budget. For
interventions for which budgets were not available or which were part of larger integrated programs (for
example, iron and folic acid supplementation in pregnancy), an indirect (that is, ingredient-based) costing
approach was used.

The unit cost estimates represent the total cost for the health system. This includes the government
organizations, as well as other organizations (nongovernmental organizations, UN family organizations)
involved in in the provision of nutrition services. It is assumed that there is no household expenditure on
these interventions. The costs of managing the national program (for example, the costs of developing
national policies and guidelines and protocols, developing pre-service and in-service training for providers,
and establishing and managing data collection and reporting systems) are included separately within PEN
and are not included in these estimates.

Complete budgets were obtained from some interventions, such as vitamin A supplementation and
deworming, to calculate unit costs. Field discussions suggested that some budgets may have
underestimated the full economic scope of implementation (for example, by not taking into account unpaid
working days).

When possible, and based on available data, intervention costs were disaggregated into key cost categories
including (1) human resources (for example, salaries and other payments to personnel providing services);2
(2) consumables (medicines and other therapeutic products, such as ready-to-use therapeutic foods, and
all other equipment with a lifespan shorter than three years‚Äîfor example, job aids, scales); (3)
transportation (the cost of moving goods and people needed to provide services, including the cost of
renting vehicles and of fuel); (4) program cost (cost of managing service delivery‚Äîfor example, the cost of
supervision and the cost of monitoring and evaluating the specific intervention) and promotion activities
(such as radio spots informing a local population that a vitamin A supplementation campaign will take place
in a given place at a given time).




1 The program experience costing approach describes a specific costing method (collecting expenditure
data from specific programs within a specific timeframe and calculating unit cost based on the number of
beneficiaries reach during that timeframe). The program costs refer to the cost of managing specific
interventions (sometimes referred to as overhead) such as the cost of supervision, the cost of M&E, and
the cost of headquarter staff.

Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation
Iron and folic acid, given in combination, are essential nutrients for pregnant women for optimal fetal growth
and development. Guinea-Bissau‚Äôs PEN recommends that pregnant women receive iron and folic acid
supplements at each prenatal appointment, with a recommended dosage of two tablets per day for the
duration of the pregnancy. The tablet supplements (60 milligrams of ferrous salt + 0.4 milligrams of folic
acid) are procured by UNICEF. The four prenatal appointments are held with nurses who distribute the
tablets, educate mothers on how to use them, and record the sales and appointments. These appointments
are said to last about 30 minutes, of which iron and folic acid supplementation takes no more than 20
percent of the time.

UNICEF estimates the total number of pregnant women to be 4.5 percent of population.3 Based on the
population estimates for 2015, this came to 68,879 pregnant women. However, the statistics center of the
Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) recorded 74,517 first antenatal appointments in the same year4. Because

of this small, and seemingly inexplicable, difference in data, it was deemed preferable to work with the
MoPH figure.

In the absence of information about numbers of iron and folic acid supplement tablets acquired, this figure
was estimated using data on attendance of prenatal appointments by pregnant women in 2015 as a proxy
for consumption of iron and folic acid. Of all the estimated 75,000 pregnant women attending their first
prenatal appointment, only one-third reach their fourth prenatal appointment. This often occurs because
mothers attend their first prenatal appointment late in their pregnancy. On average, pregnant women attend
only 2.4 appointments. Assuming that the average interval between these prenatal appointments is eight
weeks (that is, starting at week 6 of pregnancy and ending at week 38), the effective consumption of tablets
per pregnant women is 2.4 appointments √ó 8 weeks √ó 2 tablets per diem. This results in 269 tablets per
pregnant woman. If all pregnancies went ahead and all prenatal appointments were attended by expectant
mothers, per head consumption would be 448 tablets.

In order to estimate the total cost, the costs of MoPH staff and community health workers were included.
The costing of the human resources was made with the assumptions mentioned above. No information
about the transport costs for the tablets for any of the 117 health centers was available, so segments that
united these centers along the Guinean road network (using Google Maps) were created, and the distance
and time required for the tablets‚Äô transport to each health center were calculated in order to estimate
transportation costs. Given that there are many centers and that distances in Guinea-Bissau tend to be
short, it seemed more expedient to use values contracted for the internal distances by the UN agencies
(UN 2003). These data provided a cost for distances between Bissau and the 11 capitals of the health
districts. Then the distance and the duration of traveling between the capital and the health districts was
calculated.

Vitamin A Supplementation and Deworming
Vitamin A supplementation and deworming are interventions delivered through the same mechanisms and
at the same time, therefore they are explained jointly in this section in terms of the intervention process and
costing methods. However, for further analyses, the two interventions are treated separately.

PEN recommends that children 6‚Äì59 months of age be given vitamin A supplements to prevent the
debilitating effects of vitamin A deficiency such as night blindness. PEN also recommends that children 12‚Äì
59 months of age be dewormed twice every year to prevent nutrient deficiencies caused by parasites and
worms.

Twice yearly, UNICEF organizes mass immunization campaigns, which include vitamin A supplementation
and deworming aimed at children 6‚Äì59 months of age. Supplies for both vitamin A supplementation and
deworming are procured by UNICEF, which also manages these campaigns through most of the country;
the exceptions are the regions of Bafat√° and Gabu, where campaigns are organized by Plan International.
Although these campaigns are coordinated by UNICEF, there is heavy reliance on public health personnel
at regional and local levels to run a successful campaign. Other inputs to the campaigns include
supervision, training, and demand creation interventions.

At each campaign, children 6‚Äì11 months of age are given 100,000 international units (IU) of vitamin A and
children 12‚Äì59 months are given 200,000 IU of vitamin A in capsule form. Children 12‚Äì59 months are also
given one dose of mebendazole chewable tablets for deworming. In 2015, 270,790 children received these
supplements, including 39,924 children age 6‚Äì11 months and 230,866 children 12‚Äì59 months,
representing 97% of the country‚Äôs children age 6‚Äì59 months.

The cost values listed below are taken from the budget for the second campaign of 2015 (MoPH 2015a).
These documents contain coordination costs as well as the operational costs for 9 of the 11 regions in the
country. Data on the remaining regions (Bafat√° and Gabu) were provided by summary reports produced by
the regional health directorates (Dire√ß√£o Geral da Sa√∫de de Bafat√° 2015; Dire√ß√£o Regional da Sa√∫de de

Gab√∫ 2015).5 Using these data requires some specific assumptions and thus these two regions were costed
separately. In order to estimate the overall cost, we also included the regular wages paid by the MoPH
(Dire√ß√£o Geral do Or√ßamento 2012).6

As Table 3 indicates, the sparsely settled archipelagos of Bolama and Bijag√≥s weigh heavily on the overall
efficiency of service provision. Accounting for only 2% of the population, these two regions require nearly
15% of the country‚Äôs resources. Although landlocked, Farim also contains difficult crossings and poor
communications. In contrast, the input per output cost ratio is much lower in the densely populated and well
accessible capital of Bissau. Core costs cover medical supplies, essential staff, and transport of goods and
staff involved in delivering vitamin A capsules and deworming tablets. Additional costs cover supplies,
human resources, and transport expenses involved in training, coordination, and demand creation.

Breastfeeding Counseling and Complementary Feeding Education
PEN recommends that pregnant and breastfeeding women should be counseled on optimal breastfeeding
practices, including early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding for six months, and continued
breastfeeding after the introduction of solid foods. PEN also recommends that mothers of young children
be educated on the importance of balanced and diversified diets and appropriate frequency of feeding.
Families should also be educated on general nutrition practices and personal hygiene to prevent illnesses
that can lead to poor nutrition outcomes, as well as feeding and care practices during and after illness.
Currently, breastfeeding counseling takes place through several agents. These include antenatal care
appointments, skilled birth attendants, and integrated community-based promotion of breastfeeding, along
with other health interventions, all of which currently have low coverage. Breastfeeding counseling also
takes place though small mothers‚Äô groups, known as M√£es Amigas das Crian√ßas. In 2015, 1,530 mothers
participated across six regions where they were educated about optimal breastfeeding practices and
techniques. These mothers‚Äô groups are supported by the MoPH as well as UNICEF and CARITAS.

In the absence of information from the implementing nongovernmental organization, CARITAS, the costs
were estimated as cost per beneficiary of the mothers‚Äô groups run by the Dire√ß√£o de Servi√ßo de
Alimenta√ß√£o, Nutri√ß√£o e de Sobreviv√™ncia das Crian√ßas (DSANSC), for which there is an abridged budget
(DSANSC 2015). Core costs relate to the staff and materials directly involved in running the M√£es Amigas
das Crian√ßas. Additional costs cover supplies, human resources, and transport expenses involved in
training, coordination, and sensitization.

Breastfeeding counseling and complementary feeding education are two interventions generally delivered
together, and so descriptions and cost structures are combined. However, in the LiST tool, which was used
for impact modeling, breastfeeding promotion and complementary feeding education are treated as
separate interventions. Therefore, in the sections on impact and cost-effectiveness, those interventions are
presented separately and also as part of the infant and young child feeding package.

Treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition without Complications
PEN recommends using the national protocol on integrated management of acute malnutrition (GIDA,
Gest√£o Integrada da Desnutri√ß√£o Aguda) when discussing interventions for the treatment of moderate and
severe acute malnutrition (with and without complications).7 Currently, inpatient and outpatient treatment of
severe acute malnutrition is conducted in 56 centers, known as CRENAGs (Centro de Recupera√ß√£o e
Educa√ß√£o Nuntricional Ambulat√≥ria para Desnutri√ß√£o Grave) across Guinea-Bissau.8. These centers are
overseen by 11 regional nutrition coordinators (Respons√°vel da Nutri√ß√£o Regional) and managed by the
MoPH with support from UNICEF and its partners for materials, supplies, and training. After being screened
and diagnosed by the staff from one of the 146 local Centro de Recupera√ß√£o e Educa√ß√£o Nuntricional
Ambulat√≥ria para Desnutri√ß√£o Moderada (CRENAM) centers, severely malnourished patients are referred
to CRENAG centers. These centers each have two nurses and one cook. As prescribed by GIDA protocol,
children with severe acute malnutrition are treated as outpatients and receive the adequate doses of ready-
to-use therapeutic food (Plumpy‚ÄôNut) as well as appropriate medications. The average treatment lasts
seven weeks. The dosage of ready-to-use therapeutic food provided to children varies by bodyweight. For
this analysis, an average of 15 kilograms of ready-to-use therapeutic food per child is assumed.

Transport costs of the patient to the center are borne by the households or, occasionally, by the
nongovernmental organizations. UNICEF provided data on unit costs of materials. Per head doses are
indicated on the GIDA protocol. Equipment with low durability (calculators, scales, and metric instruments)
was included given its high turnover.

                                                     16
The MoPH indicated that nurses and health technicians at CRENAG centers dedicate about 40 percent of
their working time to treating outpatient children with severe acute malnutrition. Itineraries for passing
through all CRENAG centers starting from Bissau were used to estimate the transport costs of materials
and supplies in terms of fuel and services (borne by UNICEF). According to UNICEF staff, there are three
annual rounds for distributing the supplements and medications to the Centro de Recupera√ß√£o e Educa√ß√£o
Nutricional em Regime de Internamento (CRENI) and CRENAG centers. Because the treatment is
outpatient and the costs are estimated from the health system perspective, the transport of the children
with complicated severe acute malnutrition to the CRENAG is not included in the analysis.

The Treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition with Complications
Children with severe acute malnutrition with complications, which either developed during outpatient
treatment in CRENAG centers or were present when the child was screened in the community, are referred
for in-patient treatment in CRENI centers where they are treated for about five days. These patients are to
be transported to the closest of 25 CRENI units, unless transport is unavailable, in which case treatment
must be conducted at the CRENAG facility. Children with complicated severe acute malnutrition require
specifically formulated therapeutic nutritional formula (F-100) and prescription medication for treatment of
underlying infections and other complications, as indicated in the GIDA protocol.

Between 40 and 70 percent of staff time at CRENI centers is dedicated to the treatment of severe acute
malnutrition with complications. Prices of materials and supplies were provided by UNICEF. The GIDA
protocol provides information on the doses of medical inputs and other procedures. The transport of
supplies was calculated using the same methods as the calculation of outpatient treatment of severe acute
malnutrition, reflecting current practice. Activities pertaining to the educational and psychological recovery
of children were also included; a brief indication of the costs of these activities in the CRENI center of the
Hospital Sim√£o Mendes was made available by AIDA,9 a nongovernmental organization.

Salt Iodization
The PEN recommends that all salt consumed in Guinea-Bissau be iodized. This implies two distinct
operations: ensuring that all imported salt is iodized and iodizing domestic salt originating from producers‚Äô
associations. To this end, there is also a generic recommendation to ‚Äúprovide a framework for iodization
with the salt-producing associations.‚Äù PEN also advocates quality control of the iodate content in the salt
on sale in order to enforce the law. Sensitization of families and school children on the benefits of iodized
salt and other supplemented foodstuffs is also recommended.

The iodization of salt has been mandated by law since 2004, with the precise iodine level set in a 2012 law
(Locatelli-Rossi 2015). Guinean salt producers are organized in seven regional associations, which are
nongovernmental organizations rather than corporations, of varying size (see Table 4). Since 2014, a
government body called ANFA (Associa√ß√£o Nacional para Fortifica√ß√£o Alimentar) controls the quality of
the salt on sale and provides technical assistance to the country‚Äôs salt producers. Since 2015, the
associations all have adequate equipment for iodization.

The salt consumed in Guinea-Bissau largely comes either from domestic producers or from inland imports
from Senegal. The latter are predominant in the eastern regions‚Äînamely Bafat√° and landlocked Gab√∫‚Äî
where little or no salt is produced. Total salt consumption in Guinea-Bissau is roughly estimated at 6,000
tons (Locatelli-Rossi 2015) annually, of which the seven existing local producers‚Äô associations provided
approximately 60 percent in 2014 (see Table 4). This means 40 percent is divided between imports and the
hypothetical output of non-associated producers. Given the lack of import figures, this output cannot be
known with any degree of certainty. Fewer than 30 percent of the households sampled in the 2012 Standard
Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transition (SMART) survey used iodized salt, with the salt-
producing regions faring much worse than the importing regions.10

There is some evidence that the salt imported from Senegal is iodized (Locatelli-Rossi 2015; MICS 2014),
so salt iodization efforts are directed toward domestic producers. The ANFA distributes materials required
for iodization to these associations. Both consumables and durables are supplied by UNICEF, which also
organizes training. Salt iodization takes place in the associations‚Äô facilities using non specialized workers
hired on a daily basis.

The cost estimates are based on the cost of iodization per ton of iodized salt. Core costs relate to the staff,
supplies, and supplements required for the process. Information on salt production was taken from a recent
report on salt iodization (Locatelli-Rossi 2015). The costs here do not include the costs of demand creation
or promotion of iodized salt.

Information on the costs of the fortification process was obtained from ANFA. Iodization implies the
application of 80 grams of potassium-iodate per ton of salt. This requires manual work, consumables, and
fixed equipment. With the adequate equipment, a team of 10 workers can fortify 7 tons of salt every hour.
Given that the associations are based in different regions and operate independently, it seemed more
realistic to calculate the labor costs separately for each association instead of aggregating the salt
production (Table 5). With the latter option, iodization would appear slightly more efficient than with the
former, more realistic setting.

The lifetime of the durable goods was estimated by UNICEF. The cost of distributing the drums of

Therapeutic Zinc
Children with chronic diarrhea are treated in health centers, whereas those with acute diarrhea associated
with dehydration are sent to hospitals and treated by doctors. A course of therapeutic zinc is recommended
for 10‚Äì14 days for children with diarrhea, along with standard treatment including oral rehydration solution.

The total number of diarrhea cases in 2015 was 4,331, with 906 being treated for chronic diarrhea at health
centers and the remainder at hospitals. In 2015, 20,000 packs of zinc totaling 200,000 tablets were acquired
for treatment of diarrhea.11 Because this figure is higher than the calculated number of diarrhea cases for
2015, it is likely to include a stock supply of zinc as well as tablets actually used for treatment. The costs
involving the transport of supplies are assumed to be shared with the distribution of prenatal appointment
tablets for iron and folic acid supplementation.

Management of Moderate Acute Malnutrition
The UN‚Äôs World Food Programme runs a supplementary feeding program to manage moderate acute
malnutrition for children and pregnant women. In practice, however, only children were treated in 2015.12
Given the low prevalence of moderate acute malnutrition among pregnant and lactating women, support
for this demographic was expected to officially stop in 2016.

Health technicians from one of the 146 CRENAM centers, with the help of a community health worker,
screen and diagnose children for acute malnutrition in health facilities. Those found to have moderate acute
malnutrition are referred to the supplementary feeding program for treatment. The health technician must
measure and weigh the child and, depending to the results, refer her for appropriate treatment based on
GIDA criteria. Children with moderate acute malnutrition are treated with a ready-to-use supplementary
food (Plumpy‚ÄôDoz‚Ñ¢ by Nutriset) which provides the necessary nutrients for the child to recover and gain
appropriate weight. Regardless of the nutrition assessment (normal or malnourished), the technician must
also educate the caregiver on nutrition.

The World Food Programme overseas all logistics of the management of moderate malnutrition, including
acquiring, transporting, and distributing Plumpy‚ÄôDoz‚Ñ¢ buckets, as well as administrative costs incurred
throughout health districts. Until recently, the feeding program for children lasted an average of 60 days,
during which each child with moderate acute malnutrition received a weekly supplement of one bucket of
Plumpy‚ÄôDoz‚Ñ¢, which provided 47 grams of the supplement per day. From 2016 on, Plumpy‚ÄôDoz‚Ñ¢ will be
replaced by SuperCereal plus (corn soya blend++; consumed at a rate of 200 grams per day).

The World Food Programme provided data on the total cost and the number of beneficiaries, distinguishing
only between commodity and associated costs. It was not possible to obtain further disaggregation of the
data. The MoPH provided data on the number of CRENAM centers and their staff. Also, according to
information obtained from the MoPH services, health technicians at CRENAM centers dedicate about 10%
of their working time to screening the population during regular health facility visits, assessing potential
cases of malnutrition, and diagnosing these cases. The cost of transporting the patient to the CRENAM
center is borne by the households. Table 7 summarizes unit cost‚Äîthat is, the cost per beneficiary‚Äî
calculated based on the assumptions outlined above.

                          ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE SCALE-UP OF INTERVENTIONS

The costs presented in the Results section (Part III) include both the costs of maintaining the current
coverage of the intervention as well as the additional cost of expanding the coverage during the five-year
period envisaged in PEN. For the eight interventions with baseline coverage below 90 percent (see Table
8), a linear scale-up from the baseline level in 2016 to 90 percent in 2021 is assumed. For the two
interventions where the baseline coverage exceeded 90 percent (vitamin A supplementation and
deworming, 97 percent coverage for both) no scale up is assumed but rather maintenance at the current
coverage level.

For four interventions‚Äîtreatment of severe acute malnutrition without complications, treatment of severe
acute malnutrition with complications, iron and folic acid supplementation, and management of moderate
acute malnutrition‚Äîno coverage data were available, even though these interventions are currently
implemented in Guinea-Bissau. For the purposes of these analyses, zero coverage for those interventions
is assumed.

The increased program coverage in terms of the number of beneficiaries was calculated by subtracting the
current coverage rate from full coverage and multiplying this difference by the size of the target population
for each intervention. Target population estimates are based on demographic data obtained from a
combination of MICS and UNICEF data. The prevalence of child stunting (height-for-age Z-score < ‚àí2),
underweight (weight-for-age Z-score < ‚àí2), and wasting (weight-for-height Z-score < ‚àí2) among children
under five years of age in each region were obtained from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)
2014. Projected population growth rates were obtained from UNDP World Population Prospects.


                              ESTIMATING BENEFITS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS

The projected number of lives saved and cases of childhood stunting averted were calculated using the
Lives Saved Tool (LiST), which translates changes in the coverage of the interventions into estimates of
mortality reduction and changes in the prevalence of under-five stunting. LiST allows for modeling the
impact of the scale-up interventions only‚Äîthat is, the tool projects incremental changes in mortality,
morbidity, and nutrition status of children under five as the coverage in the interventions increases. One
limitation of LiST is that it does not permit an estimate of the annual impact and benefit resulting from
maintaining the current coverage of the interventions. Therefore, this section focuses on the cost, impact,
and benefits of expanding the current coverage.

Because the coverage of vitamin A supplementation and deworming exceeded 90 percent and no scale-
up was projected, the impact of those two interventions could not be modeled. Furthermore, LiST does not
include the impact of salt iodization (because it affects cognitive development rather than morbidity or
mortality) or iron and folic acid supplementation in pregnancy (because it affects maternal morbidity, but
not child morbidity or mortality). Therefore, cost-effectiveness and prioritization analyses only included
breastfeeding promotion, complementary feeding education, therapeutic zinc for the treatment of diarrhea,
the treatment of severe acute malnutrition (both complicated and uncomplicated), and the management of
moderate acute malnutrition.

Estimates of reductions in morbidity and mortality were used to calculate disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) averted. DALYs are a measure that combine mortality and morbidity, and therefore allow
comparisons of the impact of interventions affecting different conditions (for example, stunting and wasting).
The methodology used to calculate DALYs is described in Appendix B. Cost per DALY averted was used
to assess the cost-effectiveness of the package of the interventions and to compare the cost-effectiveness
of different interventions. The cost per case of stunting averted was also calculated to assess which of the
interventions are the most cost-effective for preventing stunting and averting death, thus determining which
are most effective in reducing child mortality. The method uses population attributable fractions (PAF)
based on the comparative risk assessment project (Ezzati et al. 2002; Ezzati et al. 2004) to estimate the
burden of infectious disease attributable to different forms of undernutrition using most recent Global
Burden of Disease Study (IHME 2010). DALY estimates in this study are neither discounted nor age-
weighted, in line with the methodology used in the Global Burden of Disease Study and the WHO Global
Health Estimates (2012).

Estimates of benefits were combined with information on costs to produce the cost-effectiveness measures
for each intervention as well as for the overall package of interventions. The measures for the cost-
effectiveness of the interventions were calculated in terms of cost per DALY averted, cost per life saved,
and cost per case of stunting averted. The evaluation of the cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of DALYs
averted is based on the categorization used by WHO-CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-

Effective):13 an intervention is considered to be ‚Äúvery cost-effective‚Äù if the range for the cost per DALY
averted is less than the GDP per capita;14 it is considered to be ‚Äúcost-effective‚Äù if it is between one and
three times the GDP per capita; and it is considered ‚Äúnot cost-effective‚Äù if it exceeds three times the GDP
per capita (WHO 2014a).


                                           COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

The cost-benefit analysis is based on the estimated economic value of the benefits attributable to nutrition-
specific interventions. In order to arrive at a dollar value for the impact on mortality and morbidity of a five-
year scale-up plan, estimates of the number of lives saved and the reduction in stunting prevalence
produced by the LiST were used. Following established practice, a life year saved is valued as equivalent
to gross national product (GDP) per capita (current USD, 2015); this is considered to be a conservative
measure because it accounts for only the economic and not the social value of a year of life. In order to
estimate the economic benefits generated from the reductions in stunting prevalence, the methodology
used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), which valuates a year of life lived without stunting as a 21 percent increase
in wage earnings. Benefits are discounted at three discount rates: 0, 3, and 5 percent. The net present
value and internal rate of return of the investment are also estimated. A detailed explanation of the benefit
estimation methodology can be found in Appendix C.

                                       PART III ‚Äì RESULTS
                                                 UNIT COSTS

Table 9 presents unit costs of each intervention as well as cost composition‚Äîthat is, the percentage of the
unit cost by a specific cost category or component. Program costs constitute the most significant cost driver
for vitamin A supplementation, deworming, breastfeeding counseling, and complementary feeding
education. For the infant and young child feeding package, direct service delivery costs account for only
about 20 percent of the total intervention costs. Those costs include the labor of the health care providers
and incentives for mothers (19 percent of the total costs), communication materials for mothers (0.4 percent
of the total costs), and materials for cooking demonstrations (foodstuffs and cooking fuel, 0.4 percent of the
total costs). The remaining 80 percent of the total costs cover promotional activities‚Äîincluding community
theater (42 percent of the total costs); spots on local radio (9 percent); and promotional items such as hats,
t-shirts, stickers (26 percent). In contrast, only about 10 percent of the program cost for vitamin A
supplementation and deworming was for demand creation activities and the remaining 90 percent was for
supervision and monitoring and evaluation. For the remaining interventions, it was not possible to capture
what proportion of the total cost was attributed to program costs.

Drugs and supplies account for the highest percentage of unit cost for iron and folic acid supplementation,
treatment of severe acute malnutrition with complications, salt iodization, and therapeutic zinc
supplementation for the treatment of diarrhea. Human resources account for the highest percentage cost
for the treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition and management of moderate acute
malnutrition.

Total Costs of Implementing High-Impact Interventions and the Incremental Costs of Coverage
Expansion
The total costs of implementing the 10 nutrition-specific interventions over five years in Guinea-Bissau are
estimated to be about USD 17 million (see Table 10). About USD 3.1 million would be needed to maintain
the interventions at the current level, and an additional USD 13.9 million would be needed to scale-up the
interventions (Figure 7). The small difference between the total cost (USD 17 million) and the scale-up cost
(USD 13.9 million) is because most of the interventions have low baseline coverage and will need significant
scale-up (the baseline coverage rates are shown in Table 7). In addition to the expansion of intervention
coverage, projected population growth also contributes to costs increasing over time. Therefore, even for
the two interventions where the baseline coverage exceeds 90% (vitamin A supplementation and
deworming) and no coverage expansion is modeled, costs increase as a result of population growth.

Breastfeeding promotion accounts for the largest portion of the total five-year cost (about 40 percent; see
Figure 8). This is the result of a large target group (all pregnant and lactating women) and of the high cost
per person (USD 44.20). Excluding the cost of demand creation and promotion activities, the unit cost drops
to USD 5.80 per person and the total cost declines from USD 6.8 million to less than USD 900,000 over
five years.

Providing therapeutic zinc supplementation for the treatment of diarrhea accounts for the second-largest
portion of the total cost (26 percent). Even though its unit cost is relatively low (USD 5.05 per child per
treatment), a large population is projected to be in need of this intervention. Based on diarrhea prevalence
reported in MICS (11 percent) and extrapolating this prevalence over 12 months, over 300,000 children
would need to be treated every year.

Program costs account for 50 percent of the total five-year costs of implementing nutrition interventions in
Guinea-Bissau. Because it was not possible to capture program costs for multiple interventions, it is likely
that the proportion of program costs is in fact higher. Drugs and supplies account for about 20 percent of
the total cost, human resources for 16 percent, and transport for the remaining 14 percent (see Figure 9).
The distribution of the costs across categories is virtually the same for the scale-up costs.

Bissau accounts for about a quarter of the total costs, Gabu for about 15 percent, Bafat√° for 14 percent,
Cacheu for 13 percent, Oio for 11 percent, and the other six regions for the remaining 33 percent of the
costs (see Figure 10). The distribution of costs across regions directly reflects the distribution of the
population: the costs are higher in more populated regions and lower in less population regions (see Table
12).

                            PRIORITIZATION AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS

In order to examine the potential impact of the scale-up of each intervention, as well as its cost-
effectiveness, opportunities for prioritization, and monetary benefits, the cost estimates presented above
were combined with estimates of the impact of the interventions generated using LiST.

Prioritization was based on two key indicators: the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and the cost
per case of stunting averted. DALYs averted is a key measure used in health economics to evaluate and
compare the cost-effectiveness of health programs and interventions. DALY is a measure that combines
mortality and morbidity in a single metric. Simply put, it captures the number of years of a person‚Äôs life
saved by a given intervention, and adjusts it by the health status that person is expected to have during
those years. For example, if an intervention saves a person life and that person is expected to live in perfect
health for next 30 years, the intervention would avert 30 DALYs. However, if that person would be expected
to live some portion of those years in less than perfect health‚Äîthat is, with an illness or disability‚Äîthe
number of DALYs averted would be reduced (see Salomon et al. 2013). It should be noted that, because
of the nature of the measure, interventions that impact mortality generate the greatest impact in terms of
DALYs (avert the greatest number of DALYs). For more information regarding how DALYs were estimated
see Appendix B.

In addition to DALYs, the cost per case of stunting averted was calculated. This is because preventing
stunting has benefits that go beyond health (mortality and morbidity). More specifically, chronic malnutrition
affects a child‚Äôs cognitive development, and, as mentioned in the introduction of this report, has impact on
his or her learning, educational attainment, economic productivity, and wages. Those impacts are not
captured by DALYs, which is strictly a health measure.

The analysis using the LiST model shows that scaling up all the interventions with a baseline coverage
below 90% to 90% across the entire country would allow to prevent over 2,400 child deaths and over 4,300
cases of stunting in children under five years of age over the course of five years and avert over 39,000
DALYs (see Table 13). Using the package of interventions, preventing one death would cost about USD
5,800; preventing one case of stunting, about USD 3,200; and averting one DALY, USD 356. The treatment
of severe acute malnutrition is, overall, the most cost-effective intervention in the package in terms of
DALYs. Averting one DALY through treatment of severe acute malnutrition costs only about USD 30.
Complementary feeding education is the most cost-effective intervention from the point of view of stunting
prevention. Preventing one case of stunting through complementary feeding education would cost about
USD 500. Finally, treatment of severe acute malnutrition is the most cost-effective intervention from the
point of view of mortality reduction, with the cost per death prevented of less than USD 450.

a Iron and folic acid supplementation do not affect child or maternal mortality and morbidity, with the
exception of maternal anemia; the impact on maternal anemia cannot currently be modeled using LiST,
and therefore it is not included in the analyses.
b Based on available evidence, this intervention does not impact the risk of stunting.
c Current coverage of this intervention exceeds 90%; no scale-up was modeled.
d Salt iodization does not impact mortality and morbidity; its impact of cognitive development was
included in the calculation of economic benefits.

Regional Prioritization
As discussed in the Methodology section (Part II), it was not possible to model the impact of interventions
separately for each region. Therefore, for the regional analysis, it is assumed that the portion of lives saved
and cases of stunting averted will be proportional in each region to the percentage of the target population
living in each region. For example, about 33.5 percent of all cases of severe acute malnutrition were
reported in Bissau (MICS 2014). Therefore, it is assumed that the same proportion (33.5 percent) of deaths
averted thanks to the treatment of severe acute malnutrition would occur in that region. The same approach
to apportioning health outcomes to regions was used for stunting and DALYs.

The greatest number of deaths, cases of stunting, and DALYs would be averted in Bissau, because the
largest percentage of the population lives in that region; the smallest number would be averted in Bolama
and Bijag√≥s (see Table 14). Therefore, the total cost of the scale-up would be the lowest in Bolama and
Bijag√≥s and the highest in Bissau. The analysis shows that the cost per DALY averted would be lowest in

                                                      31
Bissau (about USD 322) and highest in Biombo and Bijag√≥s (USD 526 and USD 523, respectively). The
cost per case of stunting averted would be lowest in Oio and Bafat√°. This is probably because the
prevalence of stunting, and therefore the risk of stunting, is highest in those two regions (35 percent and
34 percent, respectively) (MICS 2014). Therefore the impact of interventions lowering the likelihood of
stunting in terms of the absolute number of cases of stunting prevented would also be the highest in those
regions.

This suggests that focusing on scaling-up interventions that prevent stunting‚Äîespecially the promotion of
exclusive breastfeeding and appropriate complementary feeding practices in Oio and Bafat√°‚Äîmay be the
most cost-effective strategy for short-term reductions in the number of stunted children in Guinea-Bissau.

The cost of one death averted would be lowest in Bissau and Farim (below USD 5,300) and Bafat√° and
Gabu (below USD 5,500). This suggest that the rapid scaling up of the life-saving interventions, in particular
severe acute malnutrition treatment (the most cost-effective live-saving intervention) in those regions may
be the most cost-effective short-term strategy to reduce malnutrition-related mortality.

                                          BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS

In the base-case scenario of a 3 percent discount rate, which is the standard in health economics, the scale-
up of the interventions from the current level to 90 percent would result in total benefits from increases in
economic productivity of about USD 120 million over the productive lives of the children who benefited from
the interventions. Under this scenario, the benefit-cost ratio would be 9.8, which means that every dollar
invested in nutrition would bring about 10 dollars in economic benefits. It should be noted that the bulk of
the benefits‚Äîover 95 percent‚Äîresult from improvements in cognitive development thanks to the
prevention of chronic malnutrition and iodine deficiency and subsequent improvements in economic
productivity. Only 4.5 percent of economic benefits results from child mortality averted.

                                                                           Discount rate

As part of a sensitivity analysis, the discount rate was varied from 0 percent to 5 percent, according to the
WHO CHOICE methodology (see Table 15). Even assuming the highest discount rate of 5 percent, the
benefit-cost ratio of 5.0 remains comfortably above 1, indicating that the benefits of investing in nutrition
significantly outweigh the costs.

For this analysis, it was assumed, pessimistically, that Guinea-Bissau would grow only about 2 percent
over the productive lives of the intervention beneficiaries. Changing this assumption to a 3 percent growth
rate per year but keeping the standard 3 percent discount rate increases the expected net benefits to USD
175.8 million and the benefit cost-ratio to 14.2.

           PART IV ‚Äì CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
The two key conclusions of this report are, first, that investing in nutrition in Guinea-Bissau is cost-effective
based on international standards and, second, that investments in nutrition can generate very substantial
health and economic benefits, with one dollar spent on nutrition interventions resulting in about 10 dollars
of returns over the productive lives of children covered by high impact nutrition interventions.

The analysis shows that the total costs over five years of implementing 10 high-impact nutrition-specific
interventions in Guinea-Bissau are estimated to be about USD 17 million (see Table 9). About USD 3 million
is needed to continue current coverage of the interventions and a further USD 14 million is required to
finance the scale up of interventions. Very large benefits from the investment in this scale-up are estimated:
over 2,400 child deaths and 4,300 cases of stunting could be averted. Investing in life-saving measures
would give each child in Guinea-Bissau more years of good health and productivity and thus contribute to
the country‚Äôs growth and prosperity. Indeed, these estimates suggest increases in economic productivity of
about USD 120 million over the productive lives of the children who benefited from the interventions.

Two interventions‚Äîbreastfeeding promotion and complementary feeding education‚Äîcomprise more than
half of the total cost for scaling up, mainly as a result of larger increases needed in program coverage rates
and very high unit costs. The unit cost of each of the two interventions is almost USD 40 per child, as
compared to between USD 5 and USD 7 in other African countries in which the World Bank has conducted
similar analyses (the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, and Togo). The high unit costs
in Guinea-Bissau are mainly driven by expenditure on advocacy and outreach efforts (for example, radio
spots, community theaters, promotional materials including t-shirts and hats), rather than the costs of the
counseling. No data are available to determine whether or to what extent those activities have led to
increased uptake of breastfeeding and complementary feeding counseling and education in Guinea-Bissau.
However, the unit costs, which are substantially higher than in other countries in West Africa, suggest a
need to focus on increasing technical efficiency (reducing cost per outcome) in delivering breastfeeding
promotion and complementary feeding education programs, and thereby lowering unit costs and cost per
outcome of these two important interventions. Agencies implementing those interventions should consider
whether such high expenditures on promotional activities are necessary to ensure sufficient demand for
counseling.

Deworming and vitamin A supplementation have very high coverage rates and do not need to be scaled up
further. Small additional costs are needed only to match increases in population. Nevertheless, it is
imperative to continue financing them because both are high-impact, cost-effective interventions (Bhutta et
al. 2013). This is particularly important given the high risk of helminthic diseases and their impact. In the
short term, helminthic infections potentially cause anemia and increase morbidity, undernutrition, and the
impairment of mental and physical development (Hotez et al. 2008). In the long term, infected children are
estimated to have an average IQ loss of 3.75 points per child and they earn less as adults (43 percent) than
those who grew up free of worm infections (Bleakley 2007).

The analysis shows that the treatments of severe and moderate acute malnutrition are the most cost-
effective interventions in terms of DALYs, even though they have relatively high unit costs. Their cost-
effectiveness is likely the result of a high incidence of severe and moderate acute malnutrition in Guinea-
Bissau combined with baseline low current intervention coverage rates. An exacerbating factor is the high
incidence of infectious diseases, including diarrhea, which increases the risk of mortality from severe acute
malnutrition.

It needs to be noted that, as a mortality-morbidity measure, DALYs give highest weight to interventions that
help prevent death and acute illness. They do not capture non-health benefits, such as more optimal
cognitive development, or the resulting improvements in educational attainment or higher wages in
adulthood. This is why interventions that are effective at preventing stunting (for example, complementary
feeding education/infant and young child nutrition packages) but not mortality are less cost-effective when
DALYs are used as a basis for determining cost-effectiveness.



                                                       34
This also points to an important policy tradeoff. The analysis shows that different packages of interventions
and different geographic prioritization may be needed to tackle stunting than are needed to tackle mortality
and acute conditions resulting from malnutrition. If preventing premature death and morbidity is the priority,
it would be important to begin the coverage expansion with Bissau, which has the lowest cost per DALY
and deaths averted and is the most populous region. Key life-saving interventions to start with include
scaling up the treatment of severe acute malnutrition and breastfeeding promotion. If, on the other hand,
preventing stunting is prioritized, it would be important to focus on scaling up infant and young child feeding
in Bafat√° and Oio, where the costs per case of stunting prevented are the lowest. Summing up: if facing
budget constraints, in addition to the ambitious goals laid out in PEN, the national programs may need to
decide on short-term priorities.

Compared with estimates from other African countries (Shekar, Dayton Eberwein, and Kakietek 2016), an
annual investment of under USD 14 million per year in Guinea-Bissau is very affordable (Table 16). The
cost per DALY and cost per death averted in Guinea-Bissau are relatively high compared with other
countries in Africa where similar analyses have been conducted. This is likely because the costs of
breastfeeding promotion‚Äîthe key lifesaving intervention‚Äîare, as mentioned above, much higher in
Guinea-Bissau than in the other countries. Nevertheless, despite the relatively high cost per DALY averted,
scaling up the nutrition interventions package in Guinea-Bissau is very cost-effective by WHO standards
(WHO 2014).

It is estimated that the scale-up of key interventions would contribute substantially to reducing stunting
among children in Guinea-Bissau, thereby improving their health and later productivity. Guinea-Bissau‚Äôs
rising health expenditures that result from its disease burden must be slowed, especially as most families
are currently paying for health care out of pocket. Not only can preventing stunting and treating wasting
significantly reduce health spending, with fewer children needing to be treated for illnesses, but, perhaps
more importantly, it provides a foundation of human capital that yields a lifetime of benefits and contributes
toward a more productive society.

The analysis shows that investment in nutrition interventions would result in substantial economic benefits
and that most of those benefits stem from increased economic productivity and wages of children who
reach their full cognitive potential. The estimates of the impact of stunting prevention on cognitive ability,
productivity, and wages is based on a randomized controlled trial (the Oriente study) in a low-income setting
(Guatemala) and it is possible that, at the population level, the impact of stunting prevention may be smaller
than that reported by Hoddinott et al. (2013). However, it needs to be noted that the data from the Oriente


                                                      35
study are surprisingly consistent with cross-sectional cross-country estimates of the relationship between
adult height and adult wages, which includes low-, middle-, and high-income countries (see, for example,
Horton and Steckle 2013). Furthermore, it is clear that wage benefits will be subject to constraints related
to the supply of jobs (those demanding greater cognitive ability and jobs in general). However, it is likely
that, as the stock of human capital in Guinea-Bissau increases thanks to better nutrition and more optimal
early childhood development, employment opportunities will expand as well.

Salt iodization does not directly impact mortality or morbidity (with the exception of goiter) or risk to stunting
and it is not included in the LiST model. That is why it was not possible to estimate the impact of this
intervention on deaths or cases of stunting prevented or DALYs averted. However, salt iodization was
included in the estimate of economic benefits because of its impact on cognitive development. As noted
above, improvements in cognitive development as a result of stunting prevention and increases in the
coverage of iodized salt account for some 95% of total economic benefits. This finding highlights the
importance of scaling up this intervention in Guinea-Bissau.

Because of the limitation of the LiST tool, it is not possible estimate the impact of maintaining the current
coverage of vitamin A supplementation for children and iron and folic acid supplementation in pregnancy in
a way that would be comparable with the other interventions (see the discussion in the Methodology section
in Part II). However, data from other countries, as well as global analyses (for example, Kakietek et al.
2016), suggest that vitamin A in particular is very cost-effective both in terms of stunting prevention and
DALY reductions.

The cost estimates presented here are based on information collected from the key actors currently
delivering interventions in Guinea-Bissau. Therefore the estimates presented in this report can serve as a
reasonable approximation of what the scale-up of the interventions may cost and a reasonable basis for
cost-effectiveness analysis. It is possible that alternative delivery platforms would have different costs,
impact, and cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness assessment of different delivery platforms for specific
interventions is outside the scope of this report. However, if data are available, such analysis would be an
important next step for determining the priority of nutrition investments.

The interventions included in this report include only a small portion of all actions considered for the
inclusion under PEN. The current draft of PEN is multisectoral in character and includes nutrition-sensitive
interventions in agriculture, social protection, food security, education, and other sectors, as well as actions
aimed at strengthening nutrition governance, coordination capacity, and M&E systems in Guinea-Bissau.
Currently the available evidence regarding the impact of nutrition-sensitive interventions is insufficient to
allow for modeling their impact and, consequently, for comparative cost-effectiveness analysis (see Ruel et
al. 2013). Similarly, based on currently available data, it is impossible to estimate the impact of the
strengthening of governance on specific health and nutrition outcomes, which is why this report focuses on
only nutrition-specific interventions. Exploring nutrition-sensitive interventions, which are integrated with
other programs, will be important as a next step for the Government of Guinea-Bissau to identify even more
cost-effective and practical approaches to reducing malnutrition.

Estimating DALYs averted
To estimate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted from each intervention, the lives saved, and
stunting cases averted are first modeled using LiST.15 LiST is a part of an integrated set of tools that
comprise the Spectrum policy modeling system. Once the demographic and health data have been
updated, the coverage and scale-up plan for each intervention is introduced into LiST. Table B1 presents
data sources.

LiST can estimate the impact of each intervention in isolation from other implemented interventions or
calculate the simultaneous impact of a set of interventions implemented at the same time. The second,
simultaneous method is likely to yield slightly lower estimates because interventions may have overlapping
benefits. This analysis presents the individual or isolated results of the 10 interventions for full coverage
(with totals calculated using the simultaneous method).

For each intervention, deaths averted are disaggregated by cause of death. To estimate the impact of
interventions in terms of DALYs, the years of life lost (YLL) and years lost to disability (YLD) are estimated
separately:

        (YLL averted)CoD = (Deaths averted)CoD * (Life expectancy at average age of death)CoD

                                    (Total YLL averted)intervention = ‚àë(YLL averted)CoD

        (YLD averted)CoD = (YLL averted)CoD * [(Total annual YLD)CoD / (Total annual YLL)CoD]

                                    (Total YLD averted)intervention = ‚àë(YLD averted) CoD

where

        CoD = cause of death.

For each cause of death impacted by an intervention, YLL averted are calculated as a product of the number
of deaths averted and the average age at death from that cause (Yang et al. 2013). Results from the 2013
update of Global Burden of Disease (IHME 2013) are used to create a ratio of age-specific total YLD and
total YLL for each cause of death in a country. This ratio is then used as a multiplier for YLL averted to
estimate the YLD averted for each cause (Montagu et al. 2013; Weinberger, Fry, and Hopkins 2015). For
curative interventions, it is assumed that there will be some disability prior to provision of the intervention
and the intervention will only avert half of the YLD.
DALYs averted by each intervention is estimated as the sum of YLL averted and YLD averted across all
causes of death impacted by a given intervention:

             (DALY averted)intervention = (total YLL averted)intervention + (total YLD averted)intervention

The estimated DALYs averted will be presented as such (for example, undiscounted) and will also be
discounted by 3 percent, which is the standard discount rate for health interventions and is also
recommended by the WHO for cost-effectiveness analysis (WHO 2014a). Sensitivity analysis will be
performed by varying the discount rate between 0 percent and 7 percent, as recommended by the WHO.

Estimating Lives Saved
The projected number of lives saved is also calculated using LiST, which translates measured coverage
changes into estimates of reductions in mortality. Because of limitations in LiST, the calculation for the
number of lives saved is based on only subset of the 10 interventions;16 thus the estimates presented are
likely to underestimate the actual number of lives saved.

Estimating Cases of Stunting Averted
In order to estimate the number of cases of under-five stunting averted attributable to the annual investment
in the scaling up of nutrition interventions, LiST is used to model changes in the prevalence of stunting over
five years, during which the interventions are projected to have reached 90 percent of the target population.
Next, changes in the prevalence of stunting over five years with no scale-up of the interventions are

16These interventions include breastfeeding counseling, complementary feeding education, vitamin A
supplementation, zinc supplementation for the treatment of diarrhea, the treatment of severe acute
malnutrition, and the management of moderate acute malnutrition.

                                                          39
modeled. Then the difference between the estimated stunting prevalence in Year 5 with the scale-up and
the prevalence in Year 5 absent the scale-up is taken, and this percentage point difference is multiplied by
the total population of children under five years of age.

The reason for using stunting prevalence in Year 5 relates to the assumptions built into the LiST model,
which assumes that stunting is itself a risk factor for becoming stunted in the next time period. As a result,
stunting prevalence remains flat during the first two years of the scale-up, before dropping precipitously
until Year 5, after which the prevalence begins to level out. The assumption is made that continuing
investments to maintain scale after Year 5 will serve to maintain the gains in stunting prevalence reduction,
and therefore this reduction is presented as a benefit attributable to a one-year investment in scaling up
nutrition.

On the other hand, when estimating stunting reduction (and lives saved) attributable to a five- year scale-
up plan, this scale-up is modeled directly in LiST and the annual results over five years are used in the cost-
benefit analysis. Using annual results over five years provides a more accurate portrayal of the direct
benefits attributable to a five-year scale-up plan, and it does not assume that the scale will necessarily be
maintained following the end of the period covered in the plan.

                      APPENDIX C: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING ECONOMIC BENEFITS

Benefits were calculated based on estimates of lives saved and cases of stunting averted obtained from
the LiST model (see above). In the base-case scenario, one life saved at age five was valuated as one
times GDP per capita. One case of stunting averted was valuated at 21 percent of GDP per capita based
on estimates of the impact of childhood stunting on adult wages (Hoddinott et al. 2013) and further adjusted
to account for the proportion of income from wages (52 percent) (based on Lubker 2007). Benefits resulting
from the prevention of cognitive losses resulting from iodine deficiency were also included.

The following equation summarizes the approach to the valuation of health outcomes and calculation of
monetary benefits:

         B = LS * (1 ‚àí P) * GDPpc + LS * P * GDPpc *(1 ‚àí S )* L + CS * GDPpc * S * L + IS * GDPpc * I

where:

          B = monetary benefits
        LS = unique lives saved
       CS = unique cases of stunting prevented
        IS = additional children who benefited from salt iodization
         P = prevalence of stunting
     GDPpc = GDP per capita
         S = percent of wage income gained as a result of the child not being stunted
          I = percent of wage income gained as a result of the child not suffering from iodine
             deficiency
         L = proportion of income from labor

The benefits were calculated over the lifetime of children benefitting from the interventions. Conservatively,
it was assumed that the children would start earning wages at the age of 18 and earn until the age of 55
(the life expectancy at birth in Guinea-Bissau).

LiST is a cohort model that produces annual estimates of prevalence and mortality in a cohort of children
0‚Äì59 months of age. Over five years, the same child would contribute to stunting prevalence and mortality
averted five times as he or she ages through the cohort (once at 0‚Äì11 months, then again at 12‚Äì23 months,
and so forth). Consequently, the same child could be saved from being stunted or from dying multiple times
during that time period (for example, a child could be at risk of dying from diarrhea at age 1, then again at
age 2, then again at age 3 and so forth).

To avoid counting and assigning a monetary value multiple times to stunting or mortality averted in the
same child, based on the LiST output, estimates were made of unique lives saved and unique cases of
stunting averted. More specifically, every year, the number of cases of stunting averted and lives saved in
children 48‚Äì59 months old who would be aging out of the LiST cohort in that year were estimated.
Consistent with the extant literature, it was assumed that after children reach five years of age, their stunting
status is irreversible and that children who are not stunted at age five would remain not stunted and vice
versa.

This paper builds on global experience and Guinea-Bissau‚Äôs specific context to identify an effective nutrition
approach along with costs and benefits of key nutrition interventions. It is intended to help guide the selection
of the most cost-effective interventions as well as strategies for scaling these up. We estimate that the costs
and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions in all regions of Guinea-Bissau would require a
public investment of USD 17 million over five years (with about USD 3 million needed to maintain the current
coverage of the interventions and USD 14 million needed to expand the coverage to reach 90 percent of the
population). The two key conclusions of this paper are, first, that investing in nutrition in Guinea-Bissau is cost-
effective based on international standards and, second, that investments in nutrition can generate very
substantial health and economic benefits, with one dollar spent on nutrition interventions resulting in about 10
dollars of returns over the productive lives of children covered by high-impact nutrition interventions. Economic
productivity could potentially increase by USD 120 million (discounted at 3 percent) over the productive lives of
the beneficiaries, with an impressive internal rate of return of 9 percent annually. These findings point to a
powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions that represent a highly cost-effective approach to reducing child
malnutrition and stunting in Guinea-Bissau.

1. Introduction
In Latin America, economic activity and population mobility are heavily dependent on transport. Many
economies rely on commodity exports and populations and economic production are concentrated in
urban areas, often far from dispersed rural populations. Thus, connectivity among cities, mining and
agricultural production areas, and external markets requires transport networks to move people and
goods cost-effectively.

Peru‚Äôs difficult topography and climate create challenges for businesses and communities, as in much of
Latin America, nearly all of the nation‚Äôs cargo travels by road. Median altitudes range from less than 500
meters above sea level on the coast and the Amazon regions to more than 3,000 meters in mountainous
areas. Extreme temperatures, floods and landslides triggered by heavy rains sometimes lead to closures
of important roads (MTC, 2005). In 1982-83 and 1997-98, severe El Ni√±o events caused flash floods and
landslides, resulting in huge losses. In 1982-83, for instance, most bridges on the northern areas of the
Pan Americana road, along the Peruvian coast, were destroyed. Not all bridges have been rebuilt and
many temporary structures remain. Such interruptions help explain the high logistics costs for export
commodities in Peru.

To support economic growth, policy makers must ensure that as Peru develops, its road network is
resilient to future shocks. Obviously, the best solution would be to fully protect the entire network against
all possible disruptions. But because resources are limited, policy makers must know which roads are
critical -- for instance, those with the most traffic, greatest socio-economic relevance, or most expensive
consequences in the event of disruption -- and the best interventions to protect them against the
disruption risks they face.

Identifying the most appropriate interventions to prevent or mitigate disruptions linked to natural
disasters in a road network is challenging. First, it is difficult (and sometimes impossible) to predict the
frequency, severity, and duration of the potential disruptions to which a road segment is exposed. Large
data sets and sophisticated modeling are needed to accurately estimate the probability of an extreme
event such as extreme rainfall or earthquake to occur in a particular place. In addition, climate change
adds considerable uncertainty to the magnitude of mean and extreme changes in precipitation that may
occur in a country or region. This uncertainty is even more pronounced at the fine scale needed for road
projects ‚Äì since downscaling climate data tends to amplify rather than reduce uncertainty.

Moreover, the economic impact of natural disasters on a road depends on many local variables that are
sometimes unknown to analysts. The impact worsens if the road is not well maintained, if deforestation
makes the terrain prone to landslides, or if emergency responses are not dispatched in a timely fashion
to make the road operational again in a short time. Whether a critical road can be repaired in a few weeks
or months can dramatically change the economic consequences of a disruption, as well as the type of
interventions required.

Finally, the economic impact of a disruption in a road network is exacerbated if the road is critical to an
economic sector, to a certain community, or to the entire transportation network. Traditionally, economic


                                                                                                           2
analyses of road interventions have been focused on project-level benefits. For instance, Peru‚Äôs
Supervisory Board for Investment in Public Transport Infrastructure (OSITAN) typically asks
concessionaries and the Ministry of Transport (MTC) to submit economic analysis for each intervention
for which they are seeking funding. The main metrics used to choose projects are financial indicators
based on future traffic demand. But this project-centered approach misses the system-wide benefits of
some interventions, particularly their impact on resilience.

So, to plan for a resilient road network, it is important to identify the critical links of a network whose
rupture the economy cannot afford, and the alternatives available to planners and policy makers to
reduce the risks associated with the disruption of those links. This papers aims to help governments solve
these challenges. Building on the framework and concepts for accessibility and criticality by (Brice√±o-
Garmendia et al., 2015), this paper proposes a methodology to set priorities within Peru‚Äôs road network,
taking a system-wide approach, and to design robust interventions that may reduce its vulnerability,
despite the uncertainties related to hazards and their impacts. Specifically, it helps answer two questions.

What are the most critical roads in the national network, and of these, which are the most exposed to
natural disasters? The study finds that because of high traffic and agriculture exports ‚Äì combined with
exposure to floods, landslides, and storm surges ‚Äì disruption risks could be especially high for three
clusters of the Peruvian road network: Carretera Central near Lima, Piura in the north and a southern part
of the Pan Americana road.

What are the most robust proactive interventions to reduce the disruption risks of these critical links? The
most robust options to mitigate disruption risk vary by link. In Piura and Pan Americana, building a flood-
proof road is the most robust option in the face of the many uncertainties considered, since it is the most
cost-efficient investment across a large number of scenarios. By contrast, for Carretera Central, building
redundancy is the most robust option.

2. Methodology
This paper uses a network approach to evaluate the vulnerability of a subset of the Peruvian road system
across a wide range of potential future conditions. Given the size and complexity of Peru‚Äôs national road
network, a systematic assessment of each link is costly in terms of data needs and computational
demands, and would not necessarily address decision makers‚Äô need to prioritize interventions. Instead,
carefully selected criticality criteria can help narrow a road network of tens of thousands of links down to
several hundred meriting further analysis.

Accordingly, this study is split into two main parts. First, we built a Geographic Information System (GIS)
model of the road network in Peru that captures the physical characteristics and cast aspects of the road,
which we use to identify a set of critical links. Critical links are those of utmost importance for the
performance of the overall network, which can be defined using different geopolitical, social, and
economic criteria. The impact that an individual road (a network segment more generally) has on the
aggregate accessibility of the country or region gives a sense of the relative importance of that individual
road in the network or, in other words, of its criticality.


                                                                                                          3
Then, for the critical links exposed to floods and landslides, we assessed the disruption risk under many
possible scenarios and compared alternative interventions to reduce this risk. We then identified the best
intervention to reduce the risk associated with floods and landslides for these links, taking into account
the uncertainties around future hazards and vulnerabilities. Here we applied state-of-the-art
methodologies to address deep uncertainties related to future conditions and data gaps.

    2.1. A network approach for measuring criticality
Ranking corridors based on their criticality can inform prioritization exercises and, ultimately, enable the
analysis of the economic and development impacts of specific interventions and policy decisions.

Peru‚Äôs road network contains 164,411 kilometers of roads, of which we wanted to identify the most critical
links. Several criteria can be used depending on the policy goal. For instance, policy makers might decide
to prioritize export outlets for agricultural products, mining corridors, or increase access for lagging areas
to main cities. Here we measured a link‚Äôs criticality in terms of the impacts that its removal would have
on the overall network. This required building a model of the road network and calculating least-cost
routes between Origin-Destination pairs (see annex for a description of the model and data).

Before calculating the impact of link removal, we applied two initial filters to identify the critical links.
First, we narrowed the network down by selecting only the least-cost routes between our set of origins
and destinations. We call these routes the indicative corridors.1 Then, we applied a second filter which we
used to capture the socio-economic importance of the different routes by looking at their traffic levels.
We ranked the links by traffic levels and selected the 10 percent links with the highest traffic ‚Äì that is with
4,000 or more vehicles per day2 (Figure 1). This step reduced the analysis to about 1.3 percent of the
national network, or 2,274 kilometers ‚Äì we call these 974 links candidate critical links.




1
  Explicit criteria were imposed to define the corridors of interest to make sure cross-country comparisons were
possible. To identify the indicative corridors, we used the Network Analyst, an extension of the ArcGIS software,
which allowed us to analyze all routes via their HDM-4 estimated RUCs, which fully reflects the physical
characteristics of the existing road network.
2
  The median average daily traffic (ADDT) for Peru is 982 vehicles. Figure 1 is adapted from (Taylor et al., 2006)
whose methodology we borrow. These authors first identify the candidate critical links as those that are part of the
least-cost route between two locations -- then measure the change in cost or in accessibility associated with the
loss of each of these links. For computation capacity reasons, in this study we modified the first step of their
application by defining the candidate critical links as those links that are part of the least-cost routes and have the
highest traffic.


                                                                                                                     4
Figure 1 indicative corridors and candidate critical links (in red). Source: author‚Äôs calculations based on
MTC data.




Once we had narrowed down the number of links, the second step was to measure the criticality of each
of the 974 candidate links by estimating the cost for the network when a link is disrupted, lost, or
degraded. We used the interdiction technique, which solves the network when some of its elements are
removed (Lu et al., 2014; Pokharel and Ieda, 2013; Ukkusuri and Yushimito, 2009). We removed each
candidate critical link sequentially and each time we recalculated the least-cost routes between all OD
pairs. With the new least-cost routes configuration (the ‚Äúsecond-best‚Äù routes), we calculate the new
performance of the network.

The performance of the network and impacts of link removal were calculated along three dimensions: the
road user cost for each OD pair, the kilometers driven for each OD pair and the total daily cost of using

                                                                                                         5
the network (using average daily traffic on each link). We aggregated the performance of the least-cost
routes at the national level using weights that reflect the importance of each OD pair. Indeed, a simple
sum of the road user cost over all the routes in the network would be misleading because some routes
are used much more frequently than others.

We thus assigned weights to the different OD pairs based on the importance of the origins and
destinations, which we measured in terms of traffic. We did this by:

ÔÇ∑   Summing the traffic getting in and out of each origin and destination node.
ÔÇ∑   Calculating for each route ‚Äì each Origin-Destination pair ‚Äì a weight w based on the gravity model:

                                                        Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±Ç ‚àó Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ∞∑
                                                 Ì†µÌ±§ =         2
                                                         Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ∞∑

where TO is the total traffic getting in and out of the origin, TD is the total traffic getting in and out of the
destination, and kmOD is the distance between the origin and destination. We also use these weights to
distribute traffic (measured at each link) between the OD pairs in the calculation of the total daily cost of
the network.

The impact of a disruption at the national level is then the difference in network performance between
the baseline conditions and the new network configuration with second-best routes when a link is
removed. The criticality of each link is thus expressed along the three same dimensions: first, by
aggregating over the network the average increase in road user cost (dollars per ton-kilometer) when the
link is removed, compared with a baseline condition with no disruptions. Second, by aggregating over the
network the average increase in kilometers that users have to drive when a disruption occurs. And third,
by calculating the total direct economic cost linked to the disruption.

The candidate critical links are ranked according to these impacts on the network when they are
disrupted: the higher these three impacts, the higher the criticality of the link.

    2.2. Exposure of critical links
Once we have identified the critical links, we overlay the network with hazard layers to identify which
ones are also exposed to natural disasters.

We used a database of flood scenarios produced by Global Flood Risk using the IMAGE Scenarios
model‚ÄîGLOFRIS (Ward et al., 2013; Winsemius et al., 2013). This model simulates daily discharge and
runoff at a horizontal resolution of 0.5¬∞ x 0.5¬∞. Deltares simulated eight return periods ‚Äì RP5, RP10,
RP25, RP50, RP100, RP250, RP500, and RP100. The model was forced using daily meteorological fields of
precipitation, temperature, and radiation for four time periods: 1960‚Äê99, which represents the baseline
climate; 2010‚Äê49 representing 2030; 2030‚Äê69 representing 2050; and 2060‚Äê99 representing 2080. The
meteorological data for the baseline climate are WATCH Forcing data (Weedon et al., 2011). The future
meteorological data are provided by the ISI‚ÄêMIP project, and consist of bias‚Äêcorrected data (Hempel et


                                                                                                               6
al., 2013) for an ensemble of five Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the CMIP5 project (Taylor et al.,
2012).3

Because Peru‚Äôs most important highway is along the coast, we also overlay the network with coastal
flood data.4 But since there are no probabilistic data we simply identify the links exposed to coastal
floods and do not calculate disruption losses linked to coastal floods.

Finally, some parts of Peru are susceptible to landslides triggered by high rainfall. Thus, we use landslide
susceptibility maps provided by Ingemmet to associate landslides to flood events.5 In places where
landslide susceptibility is high, we add landslide impacts to flood impacts for high return period floods.

    2.3. Vulnerability of critical links
Here we define the vulnerability of a link as the economic consequences of a hazard event. It is
therefore broader than structural damages to the infrastructure and includes impacts on both road
users and the government or concessionaries.

Assessing the vulnerability of exposed roads to floods was the most difficult part of this exercise because
of a lack of local data on critical parameters such as flood duration, structural damages, and traffic
rerouting. Instead of working with best guesses we built several scenarios for each unknown parameter
and relationship.

Flood duration
Data on flood duration and on the relationship between flood duration and depth were not available. This
relationship generally depends on many factors other than flood depth, such as water velocity and
topography. Thus, we constructed simple curves based on information about past floods on the Carretera
Central, the only highway for which data were available (Figure 2). We validated those curves with expert
consultations.

Structural damages
The impact that different water levels may have on a particular road segment depends on many factors
and on engineering design ‚Äì for which we had no local data. After consultations with transport and civil
engineers, we assumed that a road would have to be entirely reconstructed if water remained for more
than 30 days, or rehabilitated if water stayed 10-30 days. We assumed that for less than 10 days
underwater, a road would need only cleaning and minor maintenance. The costs of reconstruction,
rehabilitation, and cleaning depend on the characteristics of the disrupted link (Table 6 in Annex). We did
not distinguish between primary and secondary roads for the time thresholds.

Traffic rerouting during a disaster and reconstruction
When a disaster hits, different scenarios of traffic rerouting may occur. We assumed that if a landslide
hits a road, all traffic is redirected to the second-best routes. But for floods, we assumed that the share of
traffic that can drive through the flooded road depends on the water level on the road and created three
scenarios (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Relationship between water level and traffic disruption. Source: authors‚Äô calculations.




                                                                                                            8
In the optimistic scenario, 30 percent of traffic has to take the second-best route if water is between 15
and 25 centimeters, and 100 percent of traffic has to take the second-best route when water is above 60
centimeters (Figure 3). But in the pessimistic scenario, 100 percent of traffic needs to take the second-
best route when water is 30 centimeters deep (that is we assume that all vehicles on that road are too
low to drive through 30 centimeters of water). For the share of traffic that can still use the first-best route,
despite water on the road, we assume that the maximum speed remains below 30 kilometers per hour
and recalculate road user costs (RUCs) accordingly.

Not only during the event, but also during reconstruction or rehabilitation, only some traffic can use the
road. Because the exact share of traffic that can use the road during works is also unknown, we develop
three additional traffic scenarios. In the optimistic one, 90 percent of traffic can use the link during
reconstruction, at a slower pace. In the intermediate one, 80 percent can use the link. In the pessimistic
one, 70 percent of traffic can go through. In terms of timing of rerouting, we assumed that reconstruction
takes 30 days per kilometer, rehabilitation 10 days per kilometer, and cleaning 2 days per kilometer.

Landslides
In some parts of Peru, intense rainfall can trigger landslides. Where landslide susceptibility is high, we
assume that the road is destroyed and 100 percent of traffic has to be redirected to the second-best
routes. We also assume that it takes 30 days to clear the debris and reestablish disrupted connectivity.

Total cost of an event
For one flood event, the total costs for users are:

                                Ì†µÌ∞ø = Ì†µÌ∞∑ ‚àó ((1 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±†) ‚àó Ì†µÌ±ê1Ì†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌ±† ‚àó Ì†µÌ±ê2Ì†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±ë Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±° )

Where D is the number of days of the disruption, s is the share of traffic redirected to the second-best
route, c1st best is the cost of using the first-best route adjusted for the increased cost of use when partially
disrupted, and c2nd best is the cost of using the second-best route.

When a disaster strikes, not only private users suffer, but the government or concessionaries also need
to reinstate the road. Depending on the severity of the impact, they may rebuild it, rehabilitate it, or clean
it. We calculate the cost for the government or concessionaries as the number of kilometers damaged
multiplied by the cost of rehabilitation or reconstruction, depending on the structural damages (see Table
6).

We assume that during reconstruction, a share of traffic may continue to use the second-best routes,
which adds to users‚Äô costs of disruption. Our measure of vulnerability misses indirect effects such as
missed hours of work, traffic congestion, costs of missing connections with other transport modes, and
losses of perishable goods. For instance, every year, $5.2 billion of agricultural commodities ‚Äì mainly
yellow onions, grapes, quinoa, coffee, and cocoa ‚Äì are transported by road to the harbors from the Andes
and Amazonian regions. Some of these commodities are lost because of road disruptions, but these losses
were not taken into account in this paper for lack of data.

    2.4. Prioritization and choice of interventions
Decision-makers need guidance on how to reduce the vulnerability of critical links. Should they wait until
the disasters strike and simply rebuild or rehabilitate the roads? Or, should they mitigate risks in advance?

Deep uncertainty like climate change, combined with data gaps, challenge decision-makers around the
world. How can long-term decisions be made now when the parties to decisions do not know or cannot
agree on the system model relating actions to consequences or the prior probability distributions for the
key input parameters to those models (Groves and Lempert, 2007)?

Traditional analysis, sometimes called ‚ÄúPredict then Act‚Äù, hinges on accurately predicting climate and
other conditions ‚Äì then reaching consensus on what the future will bring. This approach does not work
well for long-term climate change or project-specific inventions given the multiple challenges noted
above.

Innovative methods exist for managing long-term and uncertain project risks. Robust Decision Making
(RDM) is one such approach. RDM is an iterative, quantitative, decision support methodology designed to
help policy makers identify robust strategies ‚Äì that satisfy decision-makers‚Äô objectives in many plausible
futures rather than being optimal in any single best estimate of the future. RDM asks, ‚ÄúWhat are the
strengths and limitations of our strategies, and what can we do to improve them?‚Äù

To answer this, RDM rests on a simple concept. Rather than using models and data to evaluate plans
under a single or handful of scenarios, RDM stress tests investment choices under hundreds of scenarios.
Statistical analyses of these model runs identify the key conditions under which each strategy satisfies or
fails to satisfy decision-makers‚Äô objectives. Visualizations help decision-makers understand how robust
different strategies are by benchmarking those key conditions against the range of plausible outcomes.
They also help compare strategies along other dimensions such as cost, technical feasibility, and social
acceptability (Lempert et al., 2013).

Importantly, approaches like RDM are not new: they are based on solid traditional decision-making
theories. They use existing data and models transparently, revealing critical assumptions often hidden in
analyses. Such approaches also promote consensus ‚Äì decision-makers can agree on a plan without
agreeing on predictions of the unpredictable.

Similar approaches have been applied with increasing frequency in the United States and Europe
(Haasnoot et al., 2013; Lempert and Groves, 2010). These methods are collectively referred to as ‚Äúdecision
making under deep uncertainty‚Äù (DMDU). The World Bank has been using DMDU methodologies in
various projects, ranging from hydropower investments in Nepal (Bonzanigo et al., 2015a), to water and
energy investments in Africa (Cervigni and Morris, 2015), water resources planning in Lima Peru
(Bonzanigo et al., 2015b; https://goo.gl/BRojPW), and wetland management. But few papers have applied
DMDU tools to road networks (Cervigni et al., 2016; Espinet et al., 2015).

This paper applies RDM techniques to identify the most robust interventions in each critical link ‚Äì that is,
interventions that work well no matter what the future brings.


                                                                                                          10
Available interventions
An RDM analysis typically begins by identifying available options. To reduce losses linked to the disruption
of part of the road network because of a disaster, policy makers have two sets of choices: intervene after
the disaster hits (reactive), or try to reduce possible impacts with proactive interventions beforehand.
Proactive interventions include all those that reduce or eliminate disruption losses, while reactive
interventions include rehabilitation or reconstruction of the affected road. The advantage of the latter is
that no resources are directed where they may not be needed. But intervening after a disaster may be
more costly than preventing it. In particular, rehabilitation can take time, especially for roads managed
directly by the government, so the costs for the economy at large may escalate.

We compared several proactive options with a reactive one, in which the government or concessionaries
rebuild the same road after a disaster ruined it. We considered the following proactive options:

ÔÇ∑   Interventions on the critical road. The first option is to maintain the road more frequently. Generally,
    road authorities perform two types of maintenance: routine and periodic. Routine maintenance
    involves all sorts of small interventions on a road and can be carried out once a year or more often,
    depending on the weather, on the materials used, and on the traffic. Periodic maintenance generally
    occurs every five years and includes major rehabilitation works. Proper maintenance and frequent
    cleaning of drainage structures can significantly reduce the time water remains on a road ‚Äì and in its
    turn, reduce the overall damage to the infrastructure. As intervention, we considered doubling the
    frequency of periodic maintenance, and assumed that it divides by three the length of a disruption
    due to flood.
    The second option is to upgrade the road, which may involve adding tunnels or elevating a road ‚Äì
    depending on the topography of the area. Such work can be very costly, but we assume that it would
    make the road resistant even to 100-year return period floods. The costs we use are based on
    discussions with stakeholders.

ÔÇ∑   Adding redundancy by upgrading an existing alternative to the first-best route. For each link disrupted,
    we already identified second-best routes as alternatives to the lowest-cost routes between all ODs.
    So, we explored the option of improving the roads most used by these second-best routes. For
    instance, this could imply transforming an existing secondary road, or an unpaved road, into a primary
    paved road. We considered two possible ways of adding redundancy: a large-scale increase in
    redundancy, where all road segments used for second-best routes are upgraded to primary paved
    roads, and a more targeted increase in redundancy, where only 30 percent of alternative roads are
    upgraded to primary paved roads.

These interventions have different capital and maintenance costs (see Table 6).

Uncertainties
We considered four types of uncertainties that can affect the choice of the best intervention. Some are
related to the impossibility of predicting their values; others to data gaps. The uncertainties are the
intensity, frequency, and duration of climate-related events; the structural impact of water levels on the


                                                                                                         11
road; the amount of traffic to be rerouted when a flood or landslide hits; and the time and total cost of
reconstructing a road after a disaster.

We then statistically generated 500 futures, each a combination of one value for each uncertainty. These
futures are not predictions, and we do not assign any likelihood to their occurrence. We use them to
better understand the behavior of our investment options.

Metrics
Metrics describe how we measure the performance of the different interventions. We express this
performance as the discounted sum of the difference between the costs of interventions (investment and
operations and maintenance) and the avoided average annual losses (AAAL) every year over the life cycle
of the investment:
                                                 30
                                                ‚àíÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±†(Ì†µÌ±°) + Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞ø(Ì†µÌ±°)
                                        Ì†µÌ±É = ‚àë (                              )
                                                          (1 + Ì†µÌ±ë)Ì†µÌ±°
                                                Ì†µÌ±°=1

Where AAAL is the difference between the average annual losses (AAL) with the intervention and AAL if
we do nothing.

                          Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞ø (Ì†µÌ±°) = Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞ø(Ì†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ú Ì†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±°‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±î) ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞ø(Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±õ)

Average annual losses include the total private cost to users and the cost of reactive investments to
reconstruct or rehabilitate the road after a disaster. To calculate average annual losses, we calculate
disruption costs for each return period event and aggregate them.

This measure of performance is similar to a net present value in which the only benefits of the intervention
that are considered are the avoided disruption losses. Later in this paper, an investment is ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù if
P is positive.

Choosing the most robust option
To choose the most robust option across the futures considered, several criteria can be applied. In this
paper, we use the minimum of the maximum regret across all scenarios. The regret of an option i is the
difference between the performance of the option and the performance of the best option i‚Äô for a
particular scenario s.

                                      regret(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±†) = max(Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±ñ ‚Ä≤ , Ì†µÌ±†) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±†))
                                                            Ì†µÌ±ñ‚Ä≤

We calculate regret for each option in every future, then identify the option with the lowest possible value
of regret ‚Äì our robust option, which performs well no matter what the future brings.6




6
 This metric is dependent on extreme scenarios. One way to avoid that is to compare the regret of each project to
the regret of not implementing the project.

                                                                                                               12
3. Results
    3.1. The most critical and most exposed roads in the Peruvian road network
Figure 4 visualizes the performance of the network with the three metrics when each of the 974 links is
disrupted (each point in the graph represents one link being disrupted):

    ÔÇ∑   The X-axis shows the change in the network length, measured in additional kilometers.
    ÔÇ∑   The Y-axis shows the increase in cumulative road user costs (RUC) over all OD pairs, measured in
        US dollars per vehicle
    ÔÇ∑   The shape of the plotted links represents the daily additional economic cost ‚Äì the increase in RUC
        multiplied by traffic.

Accordingly, the three metrics are correlated. When a link is removed the additional road user cost largely
depends on additional kilometers driven, because the conditions of the alternative routes tend to be
similar across the network. In addition, we pre-selected links with high traffic and we gave more weight
to OD pairs with more traffic, so that when the additional road user cost is high, the total daily economic
cost is high as well. This correlation may not hold in different contexts (rural roads for instance) where the
cost of the alternative roads depends much more on the quality of the road and where there is little traffic.
Here, since the three dimensions of criticality are correlated, we can easily use daily economic cost as a
proxy for criticality and lack of redundancy.

For most of the links considered here, the increase in RUC is less than $40 per day, the increase in length
is less than 70 kilometers, and the economic cost remains below $2 million a day (Figure 4).

Yet the disruption of some links can lead to an increase of more than 300 kilometers on average for routes
of the network, and to more than a $400 daily increase in RUC. The disruption of these links that lead to
the longest detours and highest increase in RUC generally present high costs when traffic is accounted for
(on average, between $2 million and $4 million a day). One of these links, if disrupted, leads to losses
above $4 million per day. Thus, such disruptions have very important consequences for the performance
of the network even if they last for a short time.




                                                                                                           13
Figure 4 Ranking the criticality of links in Peru‚Äôs road network




Figure 5 maps the economic costs of disruption over all candidate critical links. The links with daily costs
higher than $2 million are shown in red and all are located on the Pan Americana Highway. This is not
surprising as this is the road with the highest daily traffic and it is located between the sea and the
mountains; thus, it has little redundancy.

Next, we explore the critical links most exposed to disruptions caused by natural disasters.

First, we overlay the network with the flood maps described in section 2.2. The links with the highest cost
and kilometers increase that are also exposed to floods are all on the Pan Americana highway (Figure 5).
The cluster Pan Americana ‚Äì a set of critical links located on the Pan Americana highway ‚Äì is exposed to
river and coastal floods, and if disrupted costs close to $3 million a day to its users ‚Äì forcing them to drive
an average of 300 additional kilometers. The area North of Arequipa presents the highest economic losses
and very low redundancy, so we focus our analysis on this section (cluster Pan Americana in Figure 6).




                                                                                                            14
 Figure 5. Economic cost of road disruption in Peru




The other two clusters we considered lay on the Carretera Central, near Lima, and around Piura. The
disruption costs in these two clusters are not among the highest (Figure 6). But both clusters are
frequently affected by disasters and are strategic export routes for agricultural products. In Carretera
Central disruptions occur very frequently ‚Äì and each time, the road‚Äôs (partial) closure leads to immediate
food price rise in Lima, which affects poor people the most. Policy makers indicated that the most
vulnerable cluster is located between Lima and La Oroya.


                                                                                                       15
Finally, disruptions due to floods in the region around Piura can lead to the disconnect of four cities and
one airport ‚Äì and high losses in coffee exports.7 We focus on one particularly strategic area in the south
of the city, on one of the main export routes for coffee.

Figure 6 Critical links exposed to floods in Peru.




Note: V1, V2 and V3 are segments on the Pan Americana (map Figure 5) and the three clusters are the
ones for which we will do a full analysis.

    3.2. What is the most robust proactive intervention to reduce the vulnerability of
         critical links?
For the three critical clusters, we first calculated average annual losses with no proactive interventions
under a wide range of conditions that combine climate scenarios with different flood depth, structural
impact and traffic rerouting scenarios.

Figure 7 shows average annual losses (AAL) for the three selected clusters, with no proactive
interventions, under a range of future conditions. AAL are broken down into private losses (Figure 7, panel
a) and cost of reconstruction and rehabilitation (Figure 7, panel b). The highest AAL for users are on the

  About 58% of Peru‚Äôs coffee exports move through the Paita harbor in this area. (Brice√±o-Garmendia and Guasch,
2015) finds that the time that coffee takes from the production site to the toasting site (in our critical area) is what
most affects the competitiveness of coffee producers and exporters. Delays in reaching the toasting site can also
lead to severe losses ‚Äì particularly if the raw product remains exposed to changes in temperature before being
toasted.

                                                                                                                     16
Pan Americana highway, where traffic is the highest. For Carretera Central, ex-post costs are higher
because rainfall triggers landslides that require rebuilding the road more often.

The range of possible AAL is large because of the uncertainty considered, and we cannot attach specific
probabilities to these scenarios. Instead we perform analyses of variance to identify the main drivers
behind the range of AAL.8 For the Pan Americana, the uncertainty on future AAL mainly depends on the
impacts of climate change on flood frequency and on the uncertainty of flood duration. For Piura and
Carretera Central, the range of AAL mostly depends on the duration of the disruption. For at least these
two latter clusters, our results indicate that the high losses could be reduced if the duration of the
disruption were contained.

    Figure 7. Total disruption costs (AAL) for three road clusters in Peru
        (a) Private costs (for users)                          (b) Reactive intervention costs




To decide what proactive intervention protects the road the best against uncertain disruption losses, we
calculated the economic performance of each possible intervention in the three clusters for all possible
scenarios of AAL. We consider four options:

ÔÇ∑     increased maintenance, which allows reducing disruption length,
ÔÇ∑     large-scale increase in redundancy, where we assume that most of the road segments used for
      second-best routes are upgraded to primary paved roads,
ÔÇ∑     targeted increase in redundancy, where only 30 percent of the alternative roads are upgraded to
      primary paved roads, and
ÔÇ∑     flood-proofing the first-best road, where we assume the road is elevated or drainage is highly
      improved to avoid flood losses for all events with a return period of 100 years or less.

 The analysis of variance partitions the observed variance of a variable into components attributable to different
sources of variation. In other words, we are explaining the variance of the outputs of our average losses model by
the variance of the inputs (the sources of uncertainty identified previously). Doing so tells us about the drivers that
are the most important to increase or decrease average annual losses.

                                                                                                                    17
Figure 8 shows how these four options perform, under all scenarios for the three clusters. The
performance is calculated as described in the section on Metrics, and incorporates, in the avoided losses,
both user costs and the cost of rehabilitating the road after a disaster.

 Figure 8. Performance of different interventions over 30 years, for different scenarios, for the three Clusters




 Note: These performance metrics are calculated over 30 years, with a discount rate of 3 percent and with
 the assumption that traffic will not increase in the next 30 years.


Here we assumed that the traffic on the roads analyzed does not increase in the next three decades. This
is a conservative assumption that tends to reduce the benefits of the interventions. We vary these
assumptions in the annex (with a 6 percent discount rate and a 3 percent growth rate in traffic), but these
alternative assumptions do not change the order of preference of the different interventions.

Because reactive interventions are included in the performance, whenever the performance of a proactive
intervention is negative, it means that reactive interventions are more profitable.

We then measure the robustness of interventions by calculating the maximum regret for each option in
each cluster (Table 1).


                                                                                                           18

 In bold, the option that in each cluster minimizes the maximum regret.


For all three clusters the option of doing nothing and relying only on ex-post interventions is the one with
the highest possible regret, and this regret increases as traffic increases.

For Pan Americana and Piura, the most robust option would be flood-proofing the first-best road (Table
1). Assuming that it is possible to build a flood-proof road at the costs we have used, this option provides
the greatest benefits in most scenarios. Moreover, the flood-proof road remains a better option than the
others even in some scenarios where it has negative performance ‚Äì that is, in which being reactive is
better, due to lower rainfall and optimistic assumptions about the duration of disruptions. Note that if we
assume that traffic will increase at 3 percent per year in the next 30 years, there are no scenarios in which
being reactive is better than investing in flood-proof roads, and this option always performs better than
the others. In other words, there is no regret in investing in a flood-proof road (Figure 13 in the Annex).

If the option of a flood-proof road were not available for the Pan Americana and Piura clusters, in both,
the second most robust option would be more frequent maintenance (Table 1). Here the scenarios that
lead to a negative performance are those with an optimistic assumption on flood duration ‚Äì that is, where
water recedes rapidly. Since the main benefit of improved maintenance is the reduced duration of a flood
because of cleaner drainage, for instance, if a flood lasts a short time, improved maintenance is not as
useful.

In neither of these two clusters is the option of improving redundancy profitable, but for different reasons.
For Pan Americana, the number of kilometers of roads that would need to be upgraded to improve
redundancy is very high (840 kilometers), so even if the potential disruption costs are very high (Figure 7),
they do not offset the cost of upgrading all those roads. For Piura, the number of kilometers to upgrade
is smaller (400 kilometers) but the potential disruption losses are also lower, hence the upgrading of the
second-best routes is not profitable. This may change if we included the export losses linked to even
shorter disruptions. Note that if only a portion of the second-best routes were upgraded (third
intervention in Figure 8), this option becomes profitable in those scenarios with the highest expected
losses. These results suggest that a further, more detailed analysis about which segments of the second-
best routes would be most critical to upgrade may be useful.




                                                                                                          19
For Carretera Central, targeted upgrading of second-best routes is the most robust option (Table 1). This
occurs because Carretera Central suffers from landslides in addition to floods, so more frequent
maintenance and flood-proofing the first-best route are not as efficient. Here again, the regret of targeted
increased redundancy becomes null if traffic increases by 3% per year (Figure 13 in the Annex), so this
intervention should be implemented no matter what happens.

The Ministry of Transport is currently upgrading two roads to increase the redundancy of Carretera
Central. 9 To dive deeper into the performance of the best option for the Carretera Central, we explored
in greater detail the profitability of these two projects. To simplify the analysis, we calculated the
performance of increasing redundancy only considering losses from landslides (which cause the biggest
losses in this cluster). Moreover, we varied the probability of occurrence (and duration of disruption) of
landslides every year and the discount rate, as before.

 Figure 9. Profitability of increased redundancy around Carretera Central for different probabilities
 of occurrence of events and different discount rates.
 0 percent growth in traffic                        3 percent annual growth in traffic




Figure 9 shows the profitability of the investment (that is, whether or not the performance of the
investment is positive) for different probabilities of occurrence of landslides and different discount rates.
The left panel calculates performance assuming there is no increase in traffic while the right panel
assumes there is an annual growth rate of 3 percent for traffic. According to these results, for any discount
rate lower than 15 percent, the investment makes sense even if traffic is disrupted for one day because
of a small landslide and even if traffic does not increase for the next 30 years. If traffic does increase, the
investment makes sense even with an 18 percent discount rate for any frequency of landslides.

     Road 1: Huaura ‚Äì Say√°n ‚Äì Churin ‚Äì Oyon ‚Äì Ambo = 283.5 km. Road 2: Lima (Puente Santa Anita) ‚Äì Canta ‚Äì
    Unish (Vicco) = 239.3 Km. Cost: around $700 million.


                                                                                                             20
Finally, we evaluate a more challenging investment to avoid landslides on the Carretera Central: a tunnel.
We repeat the analysis assuming that the tunnel avoids all losses but costs $33 million per kilometer.

 Figure 10. Profitability of a tunnel on Carretera Central for different probabilities of occurrence of
 events and different discount rates.
 0 percent growth in traffic                        3 percent annual growth in traffic




Unlike with the option of upgrading alternative roads, if traffic does not increase the option of the tunnel
is only profitable for relatively low discount rates (lower than 10 percent), or higher discount rates and
high probabilities of occurrence of landslides. If traffic increases by 3 percent a year, the tunnel is
profitable with a discount rate of up to 12 percent. But discount rates are usually lower than 10 percent
for public infrastructure investments so this option is still quite robust and should be considered by the
local authorities or the government. Indeed, one advantage of tunnels is that they do not need to be
rebuilt after an extreme event ‚Äì unlike upgrading alternative roads.

Again, these results consider only private losses. If we included commercial costs, tunnels would probably
make even more economic sense on roads subject to frequent landslides.

4. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations
Faced with the challenge of allocating resources efficiently and prioritizing the most urgent investments
on road networks, decision-makers struggle to identify the most critical links and evaluate their
vulnerability in the face of uncertain future events and uncertainties about their impact. This paper sought
to answer two key questions. First, what are the most critical roads in Peru‚Äôs national network, and which
are the most exposed to natural disasters? Second, what are the most robust proactive interventions to
reduce the vulnerability of critical links?

To help answer these questions, the paper shows how to effectively combine traditional transport models,
like HDM-4, with innovative network analysis and state-of-the-art methods for managing uncertainties
about the future.


                                                                                                          21
By using the interdiction technique on thousands of links, this paper shows how to select the most critical
links. Ideally this phase would be conducted in close collaboration with policy makers, who are generally
well aware of the most critical links and can bring nuances to the selection. Analysts can easily take into
account additional qualitative information on the strategic or economic relevance of some links to
improve the decisions. The combination of quantitative information on disruption costs and knowledge
of the local challenges allows the identification of the most important areas of the network for further
analysis.

This paper then demonstrates how to identify the most exposed of these links to natural hazards by
overlaying the network with hazard data and factoring in different parameters of their vulnerability ‚Äì such
as flood depth and duration, traffic rerouting, and structural damage. Finally, by running hundreds of
scenarios of possible events and their impacts, it applies a robust decision-making approach to guide an
analysis of policy options available when a road network is exposed to unpredictable climate events.

More data are needed to evaluate the full economic and social costs of disruptions and improve the
economic analysis on the most vulnerable links of Peru‚Äôs road networks. In addition, other non-
engineering solutions exist to reduce the vulnerability of the critical links that could be as effective, if not
more, as the options explored in this paper. They include reforestation, traffic management, and
multimodality. Reforestation, for instance, could significantly reduce the risk of landslides. Finally, traffic
management, particularly if linked to early warning systems, could reduce losses during a disaster, by
redirecting traffic to alternative routes and lowering the costs of a disruption afterwards by avoiding
congestion.

    6.1. The road network
We constructed a GIS road network for Peru and allocated the RUC and the vehicle speed (km/hour)
produced by HDM-4 based on the roads‚Äô attributes‚Äîclass, condition, type of pavement, number of lanes,
terrain and traffic level. For road segments in urban areas, we recalculated speed with the Google
Directions Application program interface (API) to capture the impact of congestion.

The Ministry of Transport and Communication (MTC) provided a georeferenced road network data set
that contained data on surface type and road condition for 93 percent of the country‚Äôs roads, updated in
May 2015. However, it lacked information on terrain, which is an input to HDM-4. Thus, we used a Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) to classify the country into 15 geographies and extracted elevation data at fixed
intervals along the line of the road network. We calculated terrain class for each link and grouped them
into the seven terrain types used by the HDM-4 model. Though we obtained traffic volume data (AADT)
from the MTC, it was not georeferenced or included as one of the attributes in the GIS network. Hence,
based on the origin and destination pair of the AADT, we identified the location of origin and destination
(OD) and attributed the primary roads that can connect the OD with the shortest distance (the simulation
is based on the shortest path routing algorithm). Once we had all the needed information to match the
physical characteristics of the GIS network with the outputs of HDM-4, we appended the corresponding
road user cost and vehicle speed to each link.

We then selected ODs using national and provincial capital cities, population centers of over 25,000
inhabitants, main ports and airports, and border crossing, generating a total of 93 nodes total. Based on

                                                                                                          25
the GIS road network and the 93 nodes, we used the shortest path routing algorithm to compute number
of kilometers, travel time, and total road user cost for each origin-destination pair (or route).

    6.2. GIS Data Limitations
A number of limitations associated with the input data sets and the methods used in this analysis should
be taken into account in the interpretation of results.

Scale of roads. The scale of the source data (that is, the level of detail) for roads is unknown, but there are
obvious differences between the countries and in comparison with large-scale data sets such as Open
Street Map. The smaller the scale, the less likely the features in the geographic information system (GIS)
data will accurately represent the geometry of the roads on the ground. As a result, the total kilometers
calculated based on the GIS data will deviate, to some degree, from the officially reported statistics. In
figure 11 below, scale makes a big difference in the calculated sinuosity index value.

Spatial resolution of the elevation model. The spatial resolution of the elevation model also presents a
challenge, particularly with respect to the average width of roads. Figure 11 below shows a road drawn
with a width of 7 meters, approximately one-third of the size of an elevation cell. In this case, extracted z-
values will be affected by roadside features, particularly in areas of high relief.




                                                                                                            26
Segmentation. In the terrain analysis, road characteristics are calculated by segment, which is defined
somewhat arbitrarily according to the network geometry. While the start and end of a segment may not
necessarily define a homogenous feature, errors in network geometry only exacerbate the problem.

     6.3. The Highway Development and Management Model, HDM-4
Road user costs (RUC)10 and speed (km/hour) are calculated for roads of different attributes using the
World Bank‚Äôs Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4). This software package was built
to evaluate and assess road maintenance, improvement, and investment projects. Inputs into HDM-4
include both road characteristics (network type, terrain, surface, and pavement condition) and vehicle
fleets information (traffic classes). For the purposes of this study, the vehicle fleet data were collected at
the country level with a heavy truck taken as the representative vehicle. For each of the possible
combinations of road characteristics and traffic class (6,804 in total), we calculated in HDM-4 a unique
road user cost and travel speed estimate.

Road conditions definition in HDM4
(http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/SSATPWP89A-RONET.pdf)

For paved roads, the road condition classes are defined as follows:

     -   Very Good: Roads in very good condition require no capital road works.
     -   Good: Roads in good condition are largely free of defects, requiring some minor maintenance
         works, such as preventive treatment or crack sealing.
     -   Fair: Roads in fair condition are roads with defects and weakened structural resistance, requiring
         resurfacing of the pavement (periodic maintenance), but without the need to demolish the
         existing pavement.

10
  RUCs are defined as the unit cost of using a road expressed in dollars per ton-kilometer and consist of vehicle
operating costs (VOCs), which reflect the cost of operating a vehicle, and value of time costs (VOTs), which reflect
the cost of time associated with using a vehicle. VOCs include the costs of fuel, lubricants, tires, maintenance parts
and maintenance labor, crew time, depreciation, interest, and overhead. The VOTs include the cost of passenger
time and the cargo time. Each of these components is calculated separately as an output of the HDM-4 model.

                                                                                                                   27
    -   Poor: Roads in poor condition require rehabilitation (strengthening or partial reconstruction).
    -   Very Poor: Roads in very poor condition require full reconstruction, almost equivalent to new
        construction.
For gravel roads, the road condition classes are defined as follows:

    -   Very Good: Roads in very good condition require no capital road works.
    -   Good: Roads in good condition are roads that require only spot regraveling.
    -   Fair: Roads in fair condition require regraveling (periodic maintenance).
    -   Poor: Roads in poor condition require partial reconstruction.
    -   Very Poor: Roads in very poor condition require full reconstruction, almost equivalent to new
        construction.
For earth roads, the road condition classes are defined as follows:

    -   Very Good: Roads in very good condition require no capital road works.
    -   Good: Roads in good condition are roads that require only spot repairs.
    -   Fair: Roads in fair condition require heavy grading (periodic maintenance).
    -   Poor: Roads in poor condition require partial reconstruction.
    -   Very Poor: Roads in very poor condition require full reconstruction, almost equivalent to new
        construction.




                                                                                                          28
    6.4. Accounting for Urban Friction
Due to higher traffic, urban centers tend to suffer from congestion problems (referred to as higher friction
in the urban center in GIS terms). The average speeds of vehicles in the city are expected to be lower than
in intercity corridors and even rural areas assuming all other conditions are equal. HDM-4 can be used to
model congestion effects by inputting a reduced speed based on travel time and speeds calculated using
Google‚Äôs Directions Application Program Interface (API), which takes congestion into account.

First, urban areas must be defined. This is done based on three criteria: percentage of built-up land;
population; and status as a national or provincial capital. Roads which intersect the urban cluster mask
are identified and considered ‚Äúurban‚Äù for the purposes of analyzing urban friction. Travel time and speeds
are then calculated for these roads using Google‚Äôs Directions API.

An ‚Äúurban friction coefficient‚Äù can be defined to provide a sense of congestion effects:

                                                                                        Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±îÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±ñ
                    Ì†µÌ±àÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±õ Ì†µÌ∞πÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±õ Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±ñ = 1 ‚àí
                                                                                 Ì†µÌ±ÇÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±îÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ô Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±Ä4 Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±†Ì†µÌ±ñ


The urban friction coefficient can be interpreted as the percentage speed reduction of the original HDM-
4 speed estimates. For the urban road links in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, the average friction
coefficients are 0.50, 0.36, and 0.39 respectively. In other words, there is on average a 50 percent speed
reduction in Colombia, 36 percent speed reduction in Ecuador, and 39 percent speed reduction in Peru in
the urban centers defined by the study.

For the calculation of road user costs in HDM-4, the speeds derived from Google were inputted directly
to the model and calculated as an additional road characteristic for all urban roads. That is, in the case of

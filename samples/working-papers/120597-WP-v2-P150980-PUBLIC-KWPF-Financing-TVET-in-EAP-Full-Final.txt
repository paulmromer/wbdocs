Introduction
The East Asia and Pacific (EAP)1 region is very diverse and there is a wide range in the extent
to which firms across these countries identify the education level of their workforce as a
major constraint (Fig 1). However, developing skills, including vocational and technical
skills, and enhancing employability are clear strategic objectives in the EAP region. Countries
in the region face strong pressures to expand their technical and vocational education and
training (TVET) systems and enhance their quality, at the same time as facing spending
pressures on basic and higher education. As this demand increases, the need for sustainable
financing for TVET becomes more urgent; this is not only about ensuring that sufficient and
predictable revenue streams exist to fund training programs, but perhaps just as importantly
about how financing mechanisms themselves can be strongly linked to achieving policy
objectives of making TVET systems more accessible, equitable, efficient, demand-driven,
responsive and relevant.

This brief aims to address the following key questions with regard to TVET financing in the
EAP region:2
    • Where does TVET funding come from?
    • How are TVET funds spent?
    • How are TVET funds currently allocated?
    • What role can TVET financing play in achieving TVET and national policy
        objectives?
    • How can countries create the right environment for TVET financing?

  The EAP Region here refers to: Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Korea, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia,
Myanmar, Pacific Islands, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste and
Vietnam

  The framework of this brief draws on two previous reports by the author that covered TVET financing
in the Pacific Island Countries only (cf. Palmer, 2015a; 2015b). The analysis has been significantly
expanded to cover the whole EAP region.

                                                                                                   3
Where does funding come from?
TVET funding typically comes from three main sources: government budgets, student fees,
and the private sector. In addition, other sources might include employee contributions,
private donations, income generating activities and external assistance (e.g. Official
Development Assistance (ODA) and official loans). Funding portfolios of TVET providers
across countries and across types of provision varies, but in general for the majority of
public TVET providers in the East Asia Pacific Region, government funding is the most
significant source of funds; while student fees are the most significant source of funds
for private providers. Meanwhile, training for employees in private firms is almost entirely
paid for by that firm. A few illustrative examples follow below.

In the Pacific Island Countries (PICs), excluding the Australia-Pacific Technical College
(APTC), 3 government funding makes up 38% of funding followed by tuition fees (35%),
ODA (17%) and private resources (10%) (Table 1).

Across the countries in the EAP region, TVET resources are mobilized differently between
private and public TVET providers. In Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, the
majority of funding for private TVET providers comes from student fees; while in Samoa
private TVET providers receive the bulk of their funding from NGOs and the church, and in
Tonga, Catholic church private TVET providers receive the bulk of their funds from public
grants (Palmer, 2015a). In Mongolia public vocational schools, almost all (95%) funding
comes from government budgetary allocations (Table 2).

             In the Philippines, public TVET providers such as TESDA (Technical Education and Skills
             Development Authority) training centers, TESDA-administered schools mobilize almost 95%
             of their resources from TESDA. Public universities and colleges offering non-degree TVET
             programs are financed by the Department of Education and local government units’ (LGUs)
             resources as well as students’ fees. On the other hand, private TVET providers receive
             limited resources from TESDA (4-6%), but they raise most of their funds from student fees.
             The government subsidies for private TVET operators are limited (about 5% on average), but
             more significant for NGOs (Table 3; Péano et al., 2008; World Bank, 2016a).

Government funding via grants and direct payments

In most EAP countries, government funding is the most significant source of funds for public
TVET providers. Indeed, in China (Xinjiang Province) ‘the government treats private
providers equally with public institutions in terms of… government t raining contracts,
financial subsidies, and student grants’ (World Bank, 2014: 24). In addition to China, private
TVET providers in several other EAP countries are in receipt of public funding, including
Fiji, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga (Palmer, 2015a), as well as the Philippines (ILO,
2016).


TVET funding from Official Development Assistance


Official Development Assistance

Between 2002-2014, Official Development Assistance (ODA) to vocational training5 in East
Asia and the Pacific increased overall by 133%, from US$53 million in 2002 to US$124
million in 2014.7 East Asia has significantly more ODA flows than the Pacific, as can be seen
in Fig 2, where the graph for ODA to East Asia mirrors that for East Asia and Pacific. Fig 2
also shows a peak in ODA to vocational training in the Pacific between 2007-11; much of
which was allocated to the Australia-Pacific Technical College (APTC). For country detail,
please refer to Annex (Table A1).

Over the period 2002/3-2013/14, 6 there have been increases in ODA disbursements to
vocational training in the following East Asian countries:

    •    Cambodia: US$ 1.3m to US$ 9.5m (+631%)
    •    China: US$ 19m to US$ 27.1m (+43%)
    •    Lao PDR: US$ 1.2m to US$ 14.7m (+1,125%)
    •    Mongolia: US$ 0.3m to US$ 9.7m (+3,133%)
    •    Myanmar: US$ 0.1m to US$ 9.1m (+9,000%)
    •    Timor Leste: US$ 0.3m to US$ 3.4m (+1,033%)
    •    Vietnam: US$ 8.5m to US$ 18.6m (+119%)

In particular, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Myanmar and Timor Leste have seen
significantly higher ODA disbursements for vocational training in recent years compared to
the early 2000s. In Lao PDR, ODA is estimated to make up about one quarter of the budget

  This table excludes TVET provision provided by companies directly, since these are 99.9% funded by companies
directly, and would have skewed the significance of company funding to other TVET providers in the table. The
subtotal for private providers has therefore been recalculated by the author.

  ‘Vocational training’ as defined by the DAC’s Creditor Reporting Service (CRS) code 11330 which covers both
formal and informal pre-tertiary TVET (OECD, 2014a: 2). There are great methodological challenges to looking at
ODA to TVET via the DAC CRS (cf. King an Palmer, 2011; Palmer, 2015c). 7 The financial data in this review
refers to disbursements, rather than commitments, as the former ‘provide a more accurate reflection of the
resources actually transferred from donors to recipients in a given year’ (UNESCO, 2011: 109).
6
  Two year average disbursements 2002-03 and 2013-14.

                                                                                                             6
2016-2020 (Leuang, 2016), indicating significant reliance on external funds to achieve
national objectives.

Over the same period (2002/3-2013/14), there have been significant decreases in ODA
disbursements to vocational training in three East Asian countries, signaling the decreased
importance of this type of funding for national TVET programs:

    •   Indonesia: US$ 21m to US$ 14m (-33%)
    •   Malaysia: US$ 3.3m to US$ 0.3m (-91%)
    •   Thailand: US$ 2m to US$ 0.7m (-65%)

The only East Asian country that appears to have remained relatively constant over the period
2002-2014 (albeit with a peak 2003-2006 – see Annex) is the Philippines, which had ODA
disbursements of US$ 4.4m in 2002/3 and US$ 3.7m in 2013/14.

The ODA story for the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) over the period 2002-2014 can be
largely summed up as:

    •   Significant non-country specific regional disbursements over the period 200711
        averaging US$ 19m per annum for the APTC, with significantly lower ODA support
        2002-2006 and 2012-2014.

    •   Low levels of overall ODA funding to PICs over the 2002-14 period, with the
        exception of Fiji (2010-11), Kiribati (2012-14), PNG (2003-4, 2010-11), Samoa
        (2005-6, 2010-11, and 2014), the Solomon Islands (2011, 2013), Tonga (2011-12),
        and Vanuatu (2002-04, 2009-14).

    •   In 2013-14, the PICs receiving the most amount of ODA for vocational training
        included Fiji, Kiribati, PNG and Vanuatu.

Regarding ODA support to tertiary and professional-level TVET7 in the EAP region over the
2002-2014 period, these flows started out at a comparable level to ODA support to pre-
tertiary vocational training: the average annual disbursement for the EAP region in 2002-3
was about US$ 70m for both tertiary/professional-level TVET and pre-tertiary vocational
training (calculated from table A2 in Annex). However, while ODA to pre-tertiary vocational
training increased over the period, as noted above, ODA to tertiary/professional-level TVET
declined significantly over the years 2004-2011, only to start increasing again 2012-2014
(Fig. 3). The average annual ODA disbursement 2013-14 for tertiary/professional-level TVET
in the EAP region stood at US$ 49.6m (Annex).

Reliance upon ODA for TVET, most of which is grants in-aid, varies considerably
among EAP countries; there is a marked difference between the comparatively low level of
dependence across most East Asian countries (with the exception, perhaps, of Cambodia, Lao
PDR, Myanmar and Timor Leste), and the much higher levels in some of the Pacific Island
Countries.

In the Pacific Island Countries, for example, ODA is estimated to provide about 17% of
funding in various forms, excluding Australia’s support of APTC. When funding for
APTC is included in national averages – which has been heavily reliant on ODA – ODA is the
most significant overall source of TVET funding, making up 33% of all funds, followed by
government funding (30%), tuition fees (28%) and private resources (8%). Donor dependency
is an issue for APTC operations and overseas scholarships, but not for the majority of TVET
providers in the PICs, with the exception of Kiribati (Palmer, 2015a).

Certain types of official sector transactions are not regarded by the OECD-DAC as ODA as
they do not meet the ODA criteria, and are therefore excluded from ODA tables. These are
classified by the OECD as ‘Other Official Flows’ (OOF).8

OOF does not represent a major source of finance for TVET in any EAP country. In fact the
only two countries currently with OOF flows for vocational training are China and Indonesia
(Table 4). In both cases, these represent loan agreements with the Asian Development Bank.

Regarding OOF to tertiary and professional-level TVET in the EAP region, there have
been no flows since 2006.9


TVET funding from private resources

Funding for TVET from private resources can come in the form of: students’ fees, enterprise
financing, private training provision by institutions, faith-based and NGO donations, and the
sale of goods and services. These are examined for the EAP region in brief below.


Student fees

In the EAP region, most public and private TVET providers appear to levy fees, but their
contribution to overall provider revenue varies considerably between and within countries,
and according to type of provider:

        •    In the Pacific Island Countries, student tuition fees are the second-largest source of
             funding for TVET public and private providers (excluding the Australia-Pacific
             Technical College), providing an estimated 35% of recurrent funding for the
             participating countries as a whole (Palmer, 2015a).
        •    In China, student fees (2014) accounted for a low share of revenue (8%) for
             secondary vocational schools, and about 32% for tertiary TVET providers (Yang,
             2016). This is a change from several years ago when tuition fees made up a much
             more significant proportion of revenue for secondary vocational schools (see Yang,
             2014).
        •    In Mongolia public vocational schools, only 1-2% of funding comes from student
             fees (Table 2).
        •    In the Philippines, student fees in public pre-tertiary TVET providers make up
             between approximately 0.5-5% of funding, but almost 70% among for profit private
             TVET providers (Table 3).

  OOF are ‘Transactions by the official sector with countries on the DAC List of ODA Recipients which
do not meet the conditions for eligibility as Official Development Assistance, either because they are not
primarily aimed at development, or because they have a grant element of less than 25 per cent.’

Enterprise / Industry

Funding for TVET from formal sector private enterprise and industry can take several forms,
including: private firm contribution to formal institution-based TVET provision (either in cash
or in-kind); private sector funded training funds; and, the firm-financed training for own
employees (either in-house or outsourced). In addition to formal sector firms’ contributions,
private enterprises operating in the informal economy across the EAP region are also
themselves providers, and self-funders, of training for their employees, though most of such
training is informal and on-the-job.

Enterprise contributions to formal institution-based TVET provision

Overall, financial cooperation between private enterprise and formal TVET institutes are not
significant in most EAP countries, as noted in several studies. For example:

     •   In China ‘the contribution of enterprises remains insignificant’ (ADB, 2009: 12), and
         involvement of firms in public TVET provision is low (Yang, 2016). In Xinjiang
         Province, ‘businesses… are not partners in funding the [TVET] system’ (World
         Bank, 2014). However, some collaboration does exist – see below.
     •   In Lao PDR there is limited involvement of the private sector in formal TVET
         provision (KfW, 2015).
     •   In Malaysia, ‘the public sector’s engagement with industry remains superficial’
         (World Bank, 2013a: 15) (but see below).
     •   In Vietnam, ‘the involvement of enterprises in vocational training is still weak’ (Nhan
         and Yen, 2016: 12).

However, there is acknowledgement of some collaboration between private enterprise and
formal TVET institutes, but often little indication of the extent or scope of this cooperation.
For example:

     •   In China, students in upper secondary vocational schools are required to spend a third
         of their course interning in enterprises (Mehrotra et al., 2013). In addition, a school-
         enterprise cooperation system is being set up whereby schools and enterprises
         collaborated to design and deliver skills training (Han, 2016).

     •   In Indonesia, a dual training system exists that involves partnership between
         vocational training centers and industry.10

     •   In Malaysia, ‘employers participate in curriculum development as well as the offer of
         internships and industrial training’ (World Bank, 2013a: 21). Furthermore, an
         apprenticeship scheme exists that involves a combination of theory training in
         vocational training centers and practical training within the firms of sponsoring
         employers; however, the outreach is relatively small – only 3,815 apprentices were
         trained under the 10th Malaysia Plan (Gobilee, 2016), involving about 1 in 10 TVET
         institutes (Chau Leong, 2016; personal communication 24.05.16). Another point of
         industry-TVET institute collaboration in Malaysia is the dual training system, which
         involves 70-80% of training in partner enterprises and 20-30% in TVET institutes;
         again, outreach is limited with only about 1 in a 1000 companies participating in this

         communication 24.05.16).

    •    In the Philippines, ‘companies… fund apprenticeships and short courses, as well as
         give allowances to dual training system students’ (ILO, 2016: 163). The dual training
         system involves 60% of training time in industry and 40% in vocational schools
         (Urdaneta, 2016). The Philippines also offers tax incentives to encourage enterprise
         participation in TESDA-accredited apprenticeship or dual training, including
         deduction from taxable income 50% of the amount spent by enterprises on trainees,
         and an agreed waiver for enterprises to pay trainees 75% of the minimum wage
         (Urdaneta, 2016). ‘In addition, companies can deduct 100% of a donation,
         contribution, bequest, subsidy, or financial aid made for dual training system
         operation from companies’ taxable incomes’ (World Bank, 2016a: 6). Meanwhile
         vocational training centres are incentivized through the allowance to import training
         equipment and materials tax and duty-free.

    •    In Thailand, dual vocational education is becoming more of a government focus; this
         involves 60% of training time in partner enterprises and 40% in vocational colleges.
         Companies are offered tax incentives to participate (Tongliemnak, 2016).

Private sector funded training funds

In the EAP region, there are eight countries with private enterprise financed training funds
(China, Fiji, Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, Singapore and Thailand), and
there are an additional four EAP countries that are planning to, of have proposals to, set up
such training funds (including Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam) (Fig. 4). Most of
the existing training funds are resourced by an enterprise levy (except China).

Those EAP countries with existing enterprise-financed training funds are noted below:

    •   China operates an exemption-based scheme. The 1996 Vocational Education Law
        obligates an enterprise to ‘bear the expenses for vocational education given to their
        staff and workers and persons to be employed by them’ (PRC, 1996: article 28);
        enterprises that do not provide such training are required to pay the amount that
        should have been used for staff training to the provincial government ‘and such funds
        shall be used for vocational education in the locality’ (ibid: article 29). In other
        words, enterprises are obligated to train or pay. Enterprises are required to spend 1.5-
        2.5% of their payroll towards in-service training, or else to pay an equivalent amount
        to the government (Yang and Tian, 2016).

    •   Fiji operates a levy-grant mechanism whereby the National Training and Productivity
        Centre (NTPC), which is part of the Fiji National University, collects levy money
        from industry and then pays out training grants to employers. Approximately FJ$
        12m (about US$ 6.4m) per annum is raised from this levy, representing about 12% of
        all TVET funding in Fiji. The training levy is a statutory requirement that obligates
        all employers in Fiji, except those that are specifically exempted by law, but
        including Public Service Commission on behalf of the government, to pay a levy of
        1% of gross payroll (Maglen et al., 2014).

    •   Korea has a universal training levy-grant system to which employees and employers
        contribute. Introduced in 1995, the training levy-grant system is part of the
        Employment Insurance System. All employees pay a levy for all employees as part of
        employment insurance fees (Lee, 2016).

    •   Malaysia’s Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF) is a dedicated training fund
        paid into by companies, and serves to promote enterprise training in Malaysia. The
        HRDF is administered by Pembangunan Sumber Manusia Berhad, an agency under
        the Ministry of Human Resources. It is resourced via a mandatory levy at a rate of 1%
        of the monthly wage of workers for employers with 50 or more employees and 0.5%
        for small enterprises that wish to participate (ADB, 2014a: 102; Ghazali Abdul Aziz,
        2015; Gobilee, 2016). SMEs constitute 89% of all employers registered with the
        HRDF (Ghazali Abdul Aziz, 2015).

    •   Mongolia operates an Employment Promotion Fund (EPF), which draws almost 50%
        of its funding from payments from employers for hiring foreign citizens on a
        contractual basis (World Bank, 2016b), with the bulk of remaining funds coming
        from the state budget (ILO, 2016). The EPF is used solely for financing employment
        promotion activities, ‘including short-term skills training to unemployed people, and
        to those wanting to acquire new skills or upgrade their skills in order to improve their
        employability’ (ILO, 2016: 82). In 2016, a quarter (23%) of the EPF was used to

                                                                                                     12
         resource the TVET Promotion Fund (TVETPF) (World Bank, 2016b). Overall, the
         TVETPF is meant to be 75% resourced from the EPF11 with the remaining 25% from
         the state budget. In fact, the financing received from the EPF does not reach 75%
         (World Bank, 2016b).

     •   In Papua New Guinea, employers with an annual payroll of US$78,000 or more pay a
         training levy at 2% of payroll, which raises about US$ 1.3m per annum (Horne et al.,
         2014).

     •   In Singapore, a Skills Development Fund is resourced by a 1% levy on the monthly
         remuneration of lower-wage workers.

     •   In Thailand, a national Skills Development Fund is resourced by training levies from
         enterprises.

EAP countries that have plans or proposals to set up an enterprise-financed training fund
include:

     •   Indonesia - a Skills Development Fund has been proposed to both encourage
         enterprises to train their workers and as a way to raise additional funding for training
         institutions (Skjaerlund and Van der Loop, 2015). It is expected to the resourced
         through a ‘training levy on foreign workers, which requires their employers to pay
         US$ 100 per month per foreign worker’ (Allen, 2016: 30).

     •   Lao PDR - the proposed national training fund is to be set up, and resourced through
         a 1% levy on annual salary or wages. Firms will be liable to this levy if they don’t
         conduct a sufficient amount of training for their own employees (ILO, 2016).

     •   Myanmar and Vietnam – both are proposing to set up training funds, to be resourced
         through enterprise payroll levies (ADB, 2014b; Kyaw Naing Oo, 2015).

Two additional EAP countries operate training funds not resourced by private financing:

     •   In Cambodia, a National Training Fund was set up with ADB support (19972003) and
         exists to finance the expansion and delivery of initial training before employment.
         However, it appears to be focused on disadvantaged groups and is funded from public
         resources, not private financing via an enterprise levy (Hunleng, 2013).

     •   Similarly, in Vanuatu an Education and Training Fund exists which was set up with
         Australian government funded support; it is funded by Australian ODA funding. By
         mid-2012, the government had not yet contributed to the Education and Training
         Fund, and no other development partners had indicated interest in contributing
         funding (cf. Palmer, 2015b).

Firm-financed training for own employees

Formal enterprises in the EAP countries also represent an important component of supply in
training markets (ADB, 2004), and directly finance training activities, including through
enterprise-based training (in-house professional development, apprenticeships), or paying the
fees of external providers.


11
  However, the sum received for the TVTEPF (from the EPF) is smaller than that stated in the Law
(World Bank, 2016b).

                                                                                              13
Formal training by firms in the EAP region overall is very common, averaging 40.2% - which
is close to the high income OECD country average of 44.6% and well above the world
average (35.3%) (Fig. 5).

While the EAP regional average is high, there are huge intra-regional differences with regard
to the percentage of firms offering training (Fig 6).12

   Participants from two different countries listed in Fig 6 said that they thought that the proportion of
firms in their countries listed as offering training was too high; one suggested it may be due to
methodological issues regarding the enterprise surveys conducted by the World Bank Group, which
simply asks a firm (‘yes’ or ‘no’) if they conduct training (discussions at the Second ASEAN+3 Forum on
Dual Learning System and TVET Financing, May 23-24, Seoul, Korea).

                                                                                                       14
At one end of the spectrum are countries like China, Samoa, Thailand, Cambodia, Fiji and
Mongolia where over 60-80% of formal firms offer training – much higher than the regional
average of about 40%, and the world average of about 35%. In fact, China, Samoa and
Thailand have the three highest rates of firms offering formal training in the world. It appears
that 1996 Vocational Education Law may be the reason for such apparently very high levels
of training within formal firms (of all sizes) in China. Some comment that this law empowers
provincial governments and that enterprises train for fear of incurring financial penalties or
negative publicity (Mehrotra et al., 2013); the extent to which employers also train as they
believe it is beneficial to their firm is not known. More research is needed to understand this.
Further, the percentage for Korea – 40% incidence of firms offering training – masks or
underemphasizes the huge significance of private enterprise as a funder and provider of TVET
in Korea. In contrast to perhaps all other EAP countries, the majority of all TVET in Korea is
enterprise funded and takes place after employees are hired as opposed to most other EAP
countries where most training tends to be pre-employment; in 2014 over 85% of the 3.7
million TVET trainees that year were employees. Such training of employees in Korea takes
place both within enterprises (in 40% of firms) or in TVET providers selected by enterprises
(Lee, 2016).

At the other end of the scale are countries like Indonesia, Tonga, Myanmar, Vietnam, Lao
PDR and the Philippines that have levels of firm training below the world average; Indonesia,
in particular, stands out as having a very low percentage of firms (8%) offering formal
training overall.

In addition to inter-country variation in incidence of formal training by firms, there is usually
a significant intra-country variation according to firm size (Fig. 7).

In all EAP countries for which there are data, the percentage of firms offering formal training
is highest among large firms (100+ employees). In general small firms have the lowest
incidence of formal training offerings across all countries. This is a similar pattern globally.

Countries like China, Samoa and Cambodia have relatively high proportions of firms offering
training regardless of size, whereas countries like Indonesia, Myanmar, Lao PDR, the
Philippines, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand tend to have very significantly higher incidences
of training among large and medium firms compared to small firms (Fig. 7).

Training for informal sector enterprises

International experience shows that the smallest enterprises, especially those operating in the
informal economy, are the least likely or least able to be able to provide their own training or
to invest in it.
Meanwhile, it is known that informal economies in many – but not all – EAP countries are
larger than formal economies. As a percentage of non-agricultural employment, informal
employment in East and South East Asia (excluding China) is 65% - almost identical to that
of Sub-Saharan Africa (66%). In China, 33% of non-agricultural employment is informal
employment (Vanek et al., 2014).
The sheer scale of the informal economy in many EAP countries, combined with what is
known about informal training in other regions, suggests that in many EAP countries informal
on-the-job training and learning is taking place. More research on this would be very useful.


Faith-based and NGO donations

Direct funding from churches, mosques, other faith-based organizations and NGOs appears to
be a relatively insignificant current source of funding for the majority of TVET providers.
However, in some countries (e.g. some Pacific Island Countries) this understates the essential
role that churches have played in establishing TVET providers in many instances (Palmer,
2015a).


Sale of goods and services

The sale of goods and services is also a relatively insignificant current source of funding for
the majority of TVET providers. There are exceptions to this generalization of course. For
example, private TVET providers in Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Tonga get 3-4% of their
funding from churches; still small, but not insignificant (Palmer, 2015a).

Some TVET providers in EAP countries have not been allowed to generate their own funds
through income generating activities; this has been the case in Mongolia (ILO, 2016), but
amendments to the TVET Law in February 2016 will allow TVET schools to own or run
business operations (Rinchin, 2016; World Bank, 2016b).


How are TVET funds spent?

Public spending as a percent of GDP

Table 5 gives an idea of overall public spending on TVET as a per cent of GDP in selected
EAP countries, showing that overall about 1-2% of combined GDP was spent on TVET.

TVET expenditure: recurrent and capital

The bulk of recurrent expenditure among most TVET providers in the EAP region goes
on staff salaries and other overhead costs.

       •     In one study of seven Pacific Island countries (PICs), four out of seven had recurrent
             expenditure (salaries, operating costs and overheads) of between 80-90% of total
             annual expenditure on TVET: in Vanuatu the figure was 81%, in Samoa and Tonga
             the figure was 90%, while in Fiji 96% of total expenditure was recurrent (summarized
             in Palmer, 2015a).

       •     In Mongolia, almost 70% of the total expenditure of the public vocational schools are
             on staff salaries, bonuses, social insurance contributions and other allowances (World
             Bank, 2016b).

       •     In Myanmar, teacher salaries represent the main current expenditure item of TVET
             institutions under the Department of Technical and Vocational Education (CESR,
             2013).

       •     In the Philippines, the bulk (71%) of all expenditure regarding public TVET
             providers relates to personnel expenses (salaries and wages, various allowances,
             bonus, and social security contributions), followed by other recurrent costs. 13 On
             average, significantly less is proportionally expended on personnel costs among
             private providers, while significantly more is expended on both other recurrent and
             capital costs (Table 6) (Péano et al., 2008).

     E.g. utility costs, training materials, staff development and other recurrent costs.

  This table excludes TVET provision provided by companies directly, since these are reported to have zero
additional capital costs, and so skew the incidence of private TVET provider expenditure on capital costs. The
subtotal for private providers has therefore been recalculated by the author.

                                                                                                                 18
In most East Asian and Pacific Island countries, TVET teachers are remunerated from
the national pay roll, not from TVET providers directly.

Expenditure on scholarships as the traditional form of student support in the EAP
region is common and takes many forms.

         •     Among the Pacific Island Countries, the average expenditure on scholarships was
               estimated to be about 26% of total TVET expenditure, excluding APTC (USD45
               million) (Palmer, 2015a); however 93% of this expenditure on scholarships was in
               just three of the seven countries in that particular study - Kiribati, PNG, Solomon
               Islands, scholarship (ACER, 2014b).

         •     In Lao PDR, about 40% of TVET students are supported with scholarships (Leuang,
               2016).

With the majority of expenditure on salaries and running costs, little is left for staff
development, training materials, buildings and equipment.

         •     In the Philippines, among public TVET providers, capital expenditure was only about
               6% in 2002 (Table 6). Indeed, overall expenditure by TESDA in the Philippines
               illustrates the low level of expenditures related to quality improvements including
               textbooks, instructional materials, office supplies and staff training (World Bank,
               2016a).

         •     In Myanmar, it is noted that ‘capital budgets for facilities, equipment and teaching
               materials are unfortunately constrained’ (CESR, 2013: 18).

         •     In Fiji, there was no capital expenditure recorded among private providers in 2012,
               the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Youth and Sports providers recorded 2%
               and 10% capital expenditure respectively (Maglen et al., 2014).

In Kiribati, there is very little or no funding available for professional development of staff,
material costs or new equipment (Majumdar and Teaero, 2014).


TVET expenditure and equity

A fundamental aspect of a successful TVET system is the access it provides to trainees from a
wide range of social backgrounds, ages and geographic areas. All EAP countries are likely
to exhibit some degree of inequitable access to TVET, mainly related to gender,
geography and disability – though the severity of this will vary and needs more research.15

Most Pacific Island Countries have various forms of financial assistance schemes aimed at
mitigating disadvantage. For example:

     •       Fiji offers many small scale scholarships for the disadvantaged, including for people
             with disabilities and for indigenous Fijians (Maglen et al., 2014). Indeed, many PICs
             have scholarship offerings, including to study abroad, but there is variation in the extent
             to which they are targeted at the disadvantaged.

  •   Kiribati has intake quotas from each island in both the Fisheries Training Centre and
      Marine Training Centre (Majumdar and Teaero, 2014).

  •   The Solomon Islands introduced a blanket fee subsidy at the Solomon Islands National
      University in 2013, essentially supporting all students (Bateman et al., 2014a).

In the Philippines, TESDA has major financial support schemes (all voucher operated) that
have been set up to address equity and access, including (Urdaneta, 2016; World Bank,
2016a):

  •   Private Education Student Financial Assistance (PESFA) - For high school graduates
      from poor families enrolled at private TVET institutions with TESDA-registered
      programs. Assistance covers full training cost, student allowance and book allowance.
      Over the period 2011-2015, there were on average 26,800 PESFA scholars a year. The
      budget for this form of student assistance in 2016 is PHP 200m (US$ 4.3m), meaning
      that the cost per student in 2016 is approximately PHP 7,460 (US$ 160).

  •   Training for work scholarship - At least 15 years old out of school youth and adults
      enrolled at both public and private TVET institutions and enterprises with TESDA-
      registered programs. Assistance covers full training cost and either income support for
      displaced workers (at half the daily minimum wage per training day), or training
      support for others. Over the period 2011-2015, there were on average 204,000 TWSP
      scholars a year. The budget for these scholarships in 2016 is PHP 2 billion (US$ 43m),
      meaning that the cost per student in 2016 is approximately PHP 9,800 (US$ 210).

  •   Special Training for Employment Program - A community-based training program that
      addresses the specific skills needs of the communities and promote employment,
      particularly through entrepreneurial, self-employment and service-oriented activities.
      Assistance covers full training cost, starter toolkits and training allowance.

In China, institutions that serve vulnerable groups (such as rural and ethnic minority students)
received targeted support from special government funds (World Bank, 2014). Furthermore,
the government provides tuition subsidies to all vocational school students, with tuition free
training at the upper secondary level (Kuczera and Field, 2010).


Expenditure (in)efficiencies: what unit costs tell us

Unit costs can illustrate inefficiencies in TVET systems. High unit costs might signal
inefficient use of resources, or the higher costs to reach certain groups. For example, in the
Philippines, unit cost analysis by Péano et al. (2008) suggests that the financing efficiency of
TESDA-training centres and administered schools seems limited as compared to other
providers (cf. World Bank, 2016a).

Differences between cost per student and cost per graduate for some courses indicate
inefficiencies related to course completion: the narrower the difference, the more likely that
providers achieving high course completion rates. For example, in Tonga the Institute of
Higher Education (2011/12) had a 7-fold difference between cost per student and cost per
graduate, indicating low completion levels.




                                                                                             20
How are TVET funds currently allocated?
TVET financing mechanisms (Box 1) have the potential to influence the achievement of
national development objectives (effectiveness), outputs per unit cost (efficiency) and the
degree to which people from different backgrounds and locations have access to good quality
training (equity). This section briefly examines the financing mechanisms that are currently
used in the EAP region.


Box 1. What do we mean by TVET financing mechanisms?

TVET financing mechanisms refer to:
   1. the administrative ways funds are allocated, e.g. grants, scholarships, loans, training vouchers,
        grants from training funds etc;
   2. the criteria applied to these ways – e.g. targeted/untargeted; linked to policy objectives.
        Financing mechanisms can be strongly linked to achieving policy objectives of making TVET
        systems more accessible, equitable, efficient, demand-driven, responsive and relevant.




The diversity, and sometimes fragmentation, of TVET systems results in a fragmented
approach to TVET financing. In many EAP countries, the TVET system remains quite
fragmented with multiple government ministries on the one hand, and a private training
market, firm-based enterprise training and donor-funded ventures on the other. These, and
other, multiple sources of TVET funding are allocated to multiple TVET providers via
multiple financing mechanisms. Where countries have fragmented TVET systems, with weak
TVET governance and coordination arrangements, they inevitably also have fragmented
TVET financing arrangements.


Direct public payments to TVET institutions

The financing mechanisms used by government to transfer funds to TVET providers can
affect institutional behaviour and the way funding is used (Johanson and Adams, 2004). For
example, funding can be based on: historical expenditure (e.g. a grant to cover training
materials, equipment, logistics etc), where no account is taken of performance and grants are
simply allocated based on the previous year’s expenditures; inputs (e.g. the number of
students), where incentives exist to increase student enrolment; outputs (e.g. the percentage of
students graduating or achieving a specified minimum standard), where incentives exist to
improve such metrics; or, outcomes (e.g. the percentage of graduates finding employment or
becoming self-employed within six months of graduating), again where incentives exist.

In the EAP region, historical allocation and input-based funding approaches are the
dominant modes of direct public operating grant payment to providers, and the ways
these function in the EAP region serve to reinforce a supply driven training model. In
other words, ‘most public funds are transferred and spent without rega rd for performance.
Good performance reaps no reward, and poor performance suffers no penalty’ (ADB, 2014a:
50). For example:

    •    In Mongolia, an input-based funding formula is used, based on a fixed cost per
         student (ILO, 2016).

    •    In Myanmar, budget for operations, wages and maintenance of the government
         funded Industrial Training Centre in Mandalay ‘are submitted once a year based on

                                                                                                    21
        last year expenditure’ (CESR, 2013: 37). Similarly, the budget for the Centre for Skill
        Training is ‘decided upon by the Ministry... [with] basically no difference in the
        budget allocations from year to year’ (ibid: 36).

    •   In at least three Pacific Island Countries (Kiribati, Vanuatu and Tonga), most TVET
        providers are provided with baseline funding based on historical trends, rather than on
        an input-based approach (cf. Palmer, 2015a).

    •   In other Pacific Island Countries (Fiji, Kiribati, Tonga and the Solomon Islands),
        input-based financing approaches are predominant (cf. Palmer, 2015a).

There is little evidence of output-based financing mechanisms being used in the EAP
region – e.g. little attention is paid in financial planning or budgeting discussions to course
completion rates, unit costs, graduate outcomes or employer satisfaction. For example:

    •   In Lao PDR, ‘outcome- or demand-oriented [financing] mechanisms are rare’ (KfW,
        2015: 4).

    •   In Malaysia, there is no ‘evidence that funding and other inputs [are] linked to targets
        to be achieved’ (World Bank, 2013a: 15).

    •   In Mongolia, the ‘lack of result-based financing negatively affect[s] quality of TVET’
        (World Bank, 2016b: 13).

However, there are some examples of how public funds are being used to award performance
and encourage innovation. For example:

    •   In China (Xinjiang Province), ‘exemplary training institutes and schools are praised
        and receive bonuses’ (World Bank, 2014: 25).

    •   In Korea, where public funding of training programs is increasingly tied to
        performance (World Bank, 2013b). Also in Korea, training providers that develop
        new curricula related to strategic emerging technologies and industries are eligible for
        special government support (World Bank, 2013b).


Financing policies and incentives at provider level

Financial system barriers inhibit flexibility, expansion and sustainability at provider
level. Many EAP countries appear not to have devolved much financial authority to managers
of public training institutions; decisions on spending are centralized, and most providers are
unable to retain revenue from tuition or fee for service at the institution.

In EAP countries where fees contributed by students are not retained by public TVET
providers, there are limited incentives at provider level to increase student numbers. Similarly,
where providers are not allowed to retain all (or the majority of) profits from the sale of goods
and services, there is limited incentive to generate funding from such sources. For example, in
China ‘the majority of revenue generated by training institutions is required to be submitted to
the Ministry of Education’, and providers are only allowed to keep part of this revenue
(World Bank, 2014: 21).

By contrast, private TVET providers that retain fee income have a direct incentive not only to
increase student numbers, but also to ensure that the training delivered is seen as relevant.


                                                                                              22
Similarly, public and private providers that retain income from the sale of goods and services
have a direct incentive to generate more such funds.


Financing mechanisms related to individuals: loans, scholarships, stipends

The existence of student loans to help individuals to finance TVET study appears limited, but
there is insufficient information on this to be able to say for certain.

Scholarships and stipends to study TVET exist in many EAP countries. While they have
some equity benefits, some lack alignment with labour market needs, and can come with
high actual and opportunity costs. In the PICs, scholarships, funded by governments as well
as donors, play a key role in improving access for individuals from disadvantaged
backgrounds to study at home, in the Pacific region, in Australia or New Zealand or another
country. The criteria for such scholarship allocation varies from targeting high-academic
achievers (e.g. Samoa, Kiribati), to outer Island residence (Kiribati), to people with
disabilities (Fiji), indigenous people (Fiji), to gender (Tonga), to no targeting at all (Solomon
Islands, constituency scholarships) (Palmer, 2015a).

Where stipends are targeted there may be unintended consequences for other needy groups
that don’t fit such criteria. For example, in Mongolia every student under 25 years old
enrolled in public or private TVET providers receives a monthly stipend; this age-targeting
excludes older individuals who return to TVET later in life (e.g. ex-military personnel) (ILO,
2016).


Allocation mechanisms of private enterprise financed training funds

It was noted above that many EAP countries operate private enterprise financed training
funds, with most of these funds resourced via a levy.

These training funds typically have three ways by which accrued funds are allocated
(Johanson, 2009):

    •   cost reimbursement schemes – approved training costs are reimbursed up to limit of
        levy paid;

    •   levy-grant schemes – grants for enterprises to fund training, based on specific criteria
        (not only levy contributors);

    •   exemption-based schemes (also known as train-or-pay) – liable enterprises are
        exempt from paying the training levy up to the amount they spend of training directly.

Training funds, of course, can be hybrid; using more than one such allocation scheme.

The allocation mechanisms for EAP countries with training funds are noted below:

China (exemption based) – companies are obligated by the 1996 vocational education law to
spend 1.5-2.5% of payroll on training. However, the law does not specify how the training
funds should be spent by a firm, or on who; with some suggesting that upper management




                                                                                              23
tend to us it for activities like study trips rather than to train “rank and file? employees. 16
Meanwhile, there is insufficient information on how the funds that are received from non-
training enterprises are allocated.

Fiji (cost reimbursement) – there are two mechanisms designed to reimburse enterprises for
training:

•    The first mechanism is for organizations that operate their own training programs;
     however, the vast majority of training in enterprises does not appear to meet the criteria
     for getting reimbursed and it is therefore not an effective incentive;

•    The second mechanism, open to those organizations that do not have established
     systematic training programs for their employees, requires employers to undertake
     lengthy application procedures to obtain recompense for each specific training activity; an
     endeavour that discourages many (Maglen et al., 2014).

Korea (cost reimbursement) – employers are reimbursed their training costs after training
takes place ‘in accordance with standard training costs defined by sector, occupation and
training hours’ (Lee, 2016: 16). Since 2002, SMEs have been further encouraged to train
through a subsidized grant (rebate) system that allows then to claim back three times the levy
amount that they had to pay (Lee, personal communication 24.05.16). Employee training can
be either in-firm, or the private enterprises can decide which external training provider to send
their employees to; thus stimulating a demand-driven training market (Lee, 2016).

Malaysia (cost reimbursement) – enterprises can claim a part of allowable training expenses
up to their total annual levy payments (ADB, 2014a: 102).

Mongolia – The TVET Promotion Fund (TVETPF) does not have any mechanism to re-
allocate funding back to enterprises (despite almost half of its funding coming from payments
from employers for hiring foreign citizens). Instead, the TVETPF is used to provide financial
support and stipends to all TVET students (both public and private) (World Bank, 2016b).

Papua New Guinea (hybrid: exemption-based, levy-grant) (Horne et al., 2014) –

•    The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) collects revenue from employers only if their
     qualifying training expenses (QTEs) as reported to the IRC are less than their levy
     liability. In that sense the PNG levy is exemption-based. About three quarters of
     employers claim QTEs in excess of the levy amount (2% of payroll) and hence pay no
     levy;

•    Over the years 2011-14 the annual yield of the levy varied from PGK2.8m to

PGK4.7m (US$1.09m – US$1.83m), of which the Training Assistance Fund operated by the
National Training Council (NTC) received about PGK1.5m (US$ 0.59m) to distribute to
firms providing training. In this sense the PNG levy is a levy-grant scheme;

•    The funds allocated to the NTC are distributed to firms as grants of up to PGK20,000
     (US$7,800) based on their submission of a three-year training plan, and details of the
     training to be provided.

The ‘training levy in PNG is not working well’ (Horne et al., 2014: 149), either:

•    As a source of revenue for government to fund TVET - the levy provides a very modest
     source of funds to the Training Assistance Fund (average US$ 0.6m p.a.)

•    As a training incentive for employers - the definition of what constitutes a qualifying
     training expense is wide, making it easy for employers to represent that their expenses
     exceed their liability to pay, and hard for the IRC to check.

Singapore (cost reimbursement) – the Skills Development Fund uses a reimbursement
mechanism, but does not limit the amount of incentives that a company can obtain to their
levy contribution.

Thailand (cost reimbursement via tax) – the national Skills Development Fund uses a ‘tax
deduction system to reimburse firms for part of the levy paid when training expenses are
incurred to train their staff’ (ILO, 2016: 222).


Other publicly funded incentive mechanisms to encourage private firm training

Several EAP countries (e.g. China, Thailand) offer tax incentives to private companies that
conduct training for their employees.

China offers tax incentives to firms, especially SMEs, providing workplace training
opportunities (Kuczera and Field, 2010; World Bank, 2014). Enterprises’ expenditure related
to taking these trainees on is tax deductible (Han, 2016).

Thailand encourages large private-sector firms (100+ employees) ‘to organize training for
their employees by offering tax incentives, i.e. their training expenses can be deducted
through tax exemption, calculated at twice as much as the actual training expenses’ (ILO,
2016: 222; cf. Tongliemnak, 2016).


Development partner financing mechanisms and modalities

Virtually all development partner financing for TVET across EAP countries is in the form of
grants (transfers in cash or in kind for which the recipient incurs no legal debt). Project-type
interventions are by far the most common financing modality used. Over the period 2012-
2014, 89% of all ODA disbursed to the Asia region for vocational training was in the form of
project support, while 71% of all ODA disbursed to the Pacific region for vocational training
was in the form of project support (Fig. 8).

Loan mechanisms for TVET are much less common, but exist in:

       •    Papua New Guinea – where a loan from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was
            tied to the purchase of pre-fabricated units for new Community Colleges.
       •    China and Indonesia – non-concessional loan agreements with the Asian
            Development Bank.
       •    China – ODA loan17 agreements, mainly with Germany.
       •    Vietnam – ODA loan agreements with the Asian Development Bank, France and
            Germany.

Even though development partner support represents a small proportion of overall TVET
financing for most EAP countries, the significance of such support is magnified, as it tends to
focus on capital expenditure and sectoral improvement programs.


Public-private TVET financing mechanisms

Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in TVET (Box 2) serve two main functions, only one of
which is directly related to financing. Typically, there serve to:

•      Promote cost-sharing: Private sector resources – in the form of direct funding, in-kind
       support, or direct provision – complement public support for national TVET systems, and
       are a key component of sustainable financing for TVET.

•      Increase collaboration with the private sector (e.g. in directing/governance, evaluating)
       can help achieve TVET policy objectives (e.g. making the TVET system more demand-
       driven, responsive, and relevant).




17
     ODA loans contain a grant element of at least 25%.

                                                                                             26
Box 2. What are PPPs in TVET?

PPPs in TVET refer to collaboration between the public and the private sectors with the objective of
developing the technical and vocational skills of individuals. These skills can apply both within and
outside of the formal labor force.

Types of PPPs in TVET

Public support to private training provision
    Public funds, including scholarships, vouchers, grants, subsidies, are made available to private
        providers (on a competitive basis) to supply TVET.
    Governments provide public facilities to private providers to supply TVET.

Private support to public training provision
     Direct private financial contributions to public TVET system or institutions, including (but not
         only) as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) - e.g. scholarships, grants.
     In-kind support from enterprises: Provision of trainee internships and public TVET staff
         training placements; Provision (or donation) of used equipment or training materials;
     Enterprise participation in governance, planning, curriculum and assessment (at
         provider/national level).

Joint public-private funding and delivery of training
     Co-funding from public and private sectors, and delivery of training by both public and private
        providers (or public-private providers), often brokered by an intermediary organization.


 In the EAP Region, there are several examples of PPPs in TVET:

 •   Indonesia: An ADB-supported project facilitates partnerships between polytechnic
     institutions and target industry employers, e.g.: by involving industry in the improvement
     of curricula, training placements for lecturers, and apprenticeship for trainees; by aligning
     teaching and learning environments and equipment with industry needs; by establishing a
     national skills fund, through which the government can direct funding to public and
     private polytechnics, in collaboration with their industry partners (ADB, 2012).

 •   Kiribati: the Marine Training Centre is co-funded by government, industry (a consortium
     of German shipping agencies) and donors. Key features in its success appear to have been
     the shipping industry playing a major role over a long period in establishing standards,
     having experienced staff support the training provided by the centre, providing structured
     workplace learning opportunities during training, and rigorous quality assurance
     processes (Palmer, 2015b).

 •   Lao PDR: under the ADB-funded Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and
     Training (STVET) Project (2010-2016), contracting arrangements with private firms and
     private TVET institutions were adopted ‘to improve the relevance and responsiveness of
     the TVET system, and to allow the targeting of training to areas of skill shortage’ (ADB,
     2010: 4). Two types of government contracting were implemented:

     -    Contracting with private firms for the delivery of training to TVET students and
          teachers in specialist skill areas that require expensive equipment that public TVET
          institutions could not afford (e.g., mining programs).

     -    Contracting with private TVET institutions for the delivery of training in areas
          outside the priority skill areas of the STVET Project. (Ibid: 3)

                                                                                                        27
      -    In both contracting arrangements, private firms and private TVET institutions were
           incentivized to train females through higher payments for female trainees.

•      Philippines: public financing for private postsecondary TVET (ADB, 2014a).

•      Papua New Guinea: a non-profit private provider and provincial governments have
       entered into arrangements whereby the province supplies facilities, and the provider
       undertakes to offer TVET courses at those premises. Teaching costs would be covered by
       fees, with some input of scholarships by the province (Palmer, 2015b).

•      Thailand: the dual training system, noted above, is a partnership between private sector
       and government (Tongliemnak, 2016).

Meanwhile, other EAP countries (for example Cambodia) are seeking ways to promote PPPs
in TVET (Koch, 2016; Seanglong et al., 2016).


What role can TVET financing play in achieving TVET and
national policy objectives?
As noted above, TVET financing plays an important role in leveraging TVET reform in
desired directions. All countries in the EAP region have country-specific objectives and
priorities and should consider a mix of financing mechanisms that can help achieve these
objectives, while giving consideration to the country’s enabling environment for TVET
financing – and the extent to which it will facilitate or hinder the functioning of specific
financing mechanisms (see section 6 – this report). Countries in the EAP region should also
recognize that as their TVET reform objectives change over time, so their financing
mechanisms need to change. Korea provides a great illustration from the region of how a
country’s TVET financing mechanisms have changed as national TVET objectives changed
(see Lee, 2016).


Policy Objective: Use Resources More Efficiently

Try to avoid displacing private funding with public funding - A key concern in any state-
supported or co-financed training scheme is to try to avoid paying for something that private
individuals or companies would have paid for anyway in the absence of state support.18

Rationalize funding – efficiencies could be created where funding was rationalized,
including via incentives to providers to merge and reduce overheads, or by creating an
overarching body to oversee TVET financing. Making better use of existing resources by
identifying and addressing current inefficiencies (ADB, 2009), including through unit cost
and cost-benefit analysis is as important as trying to increase the overall resource envelope.

Encourage an integrated training market – an approach worth considering is for a
government to shift from using public finance only to fund public TVET to being a purchaser
on behalf of trainees and communities – and to view the training providers in the market,
public and private, in an integrated way; such that public funds could support both public and
private providers. Various financing mechanisms can be used to encourage an integrated



18
     This section draws heavily on Palmer (2015a).

                                                                                            28
training market, including, for example, the use of grants, vouchers, or scholarships that are
available on an equal basis to both public and private providers.

At the national level the establishment of a national training fund, or a national skills
development fund, can also encourage the development of an integrated market
(Johanson, 2009). National training funds are typically financed by enterprise levies, but may
also be based on public subsidies or donor financing. If used strategically, national training
funds can help to orientate entire TVET systems in the direction of agreed national priorities.
Johanson (2009) identifies three types of training fund:

    •   Pre-employment training funds – to create a supply of well-trained individuals in the
        labor market;

    •   Enterprise training funds - to increase the incidence of training within firms;

    •   Equity training funds - to train specified target beneficiaries (e.g. unemployed,
        women, youth, those in the informal sector).

The disbursement mechanisms for national training funds depend on the type of fund. For
example, pre-employment and equity training funds might typically have disbursement
windows that are able to fund various quality-assured providers, including public and private
training institutions, and specified target beneficiaries. The most effective training funds are
those that are largely autonomous bodies with strong employer and worker representation, and
are soundly managed with clear and transparent allocation mechanisms (Johanson, 2009).
Sectoral, or industry-specific, training funds are an alternative to national (centralized)
funding models (Johanson, 2009), and may be more suited to contexts where a particular
sector is dominant (e.g. tourism, extractive industries) and employers want a more sector-
specific arrangement.

Aligning financial incentives with desired effects through results-based financing.
Results-based financing rewards the delivery or achievement of specified targets through
financial incentives upon verification that the pre-defined results have been delivered (World
Bank, 2015). For example, they may be linked to:

    •   Inputs – e.g. per student financial rewards to give incentives to increase the number of
        students

    •   Outputs - e.g. incentives linked to the total number or percentage of trainees
        completing training, or to the percentage of trainees completing training from
        marginalized groups.

    •   Outcomes – e.g. incentives linked to the percentage of trainees in employment 3 or 6
        months after completing a course, or the percentage of trainees who pass a recognized
        skills test after completing course.

By contrast, non-performance-based financing include financial transfers to providers based
on historical expenditure, where there is no incentive or disincentive to perform or under-
perform.

Several reports on the EAP region have suggested that countries use financing approaches as
a means to promote increased performance and results.

    •   An Asian Development Bank brief noted that: ‘Public funding to training institutions
        could be linked to accountability for performance, such as percentage of graduates

                                                                                             29
        employed and employer and employee satisfaction rates from training’ (Jagannathan,
        2013: 3-4).

    •   For the Philippines, the World Bank (2016a) has noted that there is a need to link
        public training funds to greater performance, and for there to be effective sanction
        mechanisms to stop government subsidies going to poorly performing providers.

    •   In Myanmar, the Comprehensive Education Sector Review Team suggested results-
        based financing in the country’s 2013 Education Sector Review: ‘A future modality
        for financing TVET could be… based on the principle that the institution will receive
        30% of the total cost for training at enrolment of the student, another 30% when the
        student has reached mid-term of the training… and finally 40%... when the training
        has been completed… This will also encourage the TVET institutions to actively
        boost the enrolment of students, the quality of training and possibly also ensure a
        higher graduation rate’ (CESR, 2013: 21).

However, performance-based financing (especially output- and outcome-based
approaches), require reliable information systems (ADB, 2014a), as well as greater
provider capacity and autonomy. Such conditions may not be present in some EAP
countries.


Policy Objective: Raise Relevance

Restructure public provision – So that public providers have more autonomy, more
incentive to respond to local demand, more incentive to perform. For example, input-based
financing approaches with the provider allowed to retain tuition fees, or incentives to generate
and retain income through the sale of goods and services at the provider level.

Expansion of private provision of TVET - Governments could encourage such an
expansion, for example by:

•   Making TVET scholarships available across the spectrum of quality-assured public and
    private providers on equal terms;

•   Offering tax incentives to promote the growth of private TVET;

•   Setting up a competitive fund with grant windows open to both public and private
    providers;

•   Providing indirect public financing for private TVET.

In a 2009 report on TVET financing in China, the Asian Development Bank recommended
that ‘the government should provide substantive support, including financial/ fiscal
incentives, to private providers who set up or expand TVET institutions’ (ADB, 2009: 15).

Align TVET scholarships to labour market needs – increase the number of TVET
scholarships that are linked to labour market needs (Bateman et al., 2014).




                                                                                             30
Policy Objective: Raise Quality

Create more reliable funding streams for expenditures related to the quality of TVET –
more predictable flows for expenditures such as the development of occupational standards,
training packages, curriculum and teacher training are needed (Horne et al., 2014).

Use competitive funds to stimulate innovation and quality improvement (ADB, 2014a:
44), both public and private TVET institutions should be able to compete for funds.


Policy Objective: Increase Access

Increased public funding of TVET is an obvious way to increase access (ADB, 2014a:
45), either through the supply of more places, or targeted fee subsidies. This may not be
possible in some EAP countries.

Private provision is a powerful way to increase access among those able to afford it.
‘Private provision reduces pressure on public funding to pay for expansion of enrolments.’
(ADB, 2014a: 45).

Input-based financing mechanisms with the provider allowed to retain tuition fees - As
noted above, these can provide powerful incentives to increase enrolment.


Policy Objective: Promote Equity

Improving access to and completion of a quality primary and secondary school
education will help make access to post-secondary TVET programs more equitable.
International experience shows that the most disadvantaged young people do not make it into
formal TVET programs as they drop out of formal schooling before entry. For many,
affirmative actions in TVET (e.g. scholarships) may come too late to assist disadvantaged
students (ADB, 2014a: 46). Policy makers interested in promoting equity in TVET should
therefore also examine financial support policies for disadvantaged students at lower levels in
the education system.

Allocate funds directly to students rather than institutions. Financial transfer mechanisms
that allocate resources to institutions are less effective in closing equity gaps because the
institutions rather than the individuals receive the funds. In contrast, programs that support
students and their families directly are more likely to be effective in increasing participation
(ADB, 2014a: 46). Giving vouchers to disadvantaged individuals to use in a training
institution of choice is one way to do this (cf Jagannathan, 2013). In contexts where vouchers
are not feasible, incentivizing TVET providers to enroll/graduate disadvantaged students
would be the next best option.

Enhance targeting of disadvantaged students to help them to “catch up.? This might be
through:

•   Better targeted scholarships / fee waivers – targeted financial support has a key role to
    play in mitigating disadvantage, and policy makers might consider reviewing their
    approaches to scholarships, including introducing more targeted approaches based on
    verifiable criteria, where these do not exist. Ensuring that financial assistance measures
    have transparent selection mechanisms are also needed (World Bank, 2016a).



                                                                                             31
•      Student loans for TVET - student loans with repayment from post-graduation earnings
       or mortgage-type loans could be explored on a pilot basis in some EAP countries.
       However, the administrative and, for income-contingent loans, the tax collection
       capability in EAP countries may limit the use of this mechanism.

•      Work and study options – increasing opportunities for concurrent work and study would
       help some disadvantaged individuals to access TVET, as they would be able to pay their
       way through the course. However, this approach is regarded by some as a ‘rather
       discriminatory dual-track option’ (ADB, 2009:12).


Policy Objective: Mobilize Non-State Resources

Stimulate private investment in TVET19 – through incentivizing private enterprises to train
own workers and contribute to overall reform efforts, encouraging PPPs and the expansion of
private provision.

Incentivizing private enterprises to train their own workers

•      Enterprise financed training funds – Many EAP countries already have skills
       development funds that are resourced via private enterprise financing (mostly via training
       levies), but the experience in at least some of these countries (e.g. Fiji, Mongolia, Papua
       New Guinea) shows that fund functionality is often sub-optimal. Detailed research on the
       effectiveness and efficiency of existing training funds in EAP region would be advisable
       before concrete recommendations could be made. Such research would also help to
       inform the design and discussions related to proposals to set up training funds in
       Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam. However, it is fair to say now that
       introducing training levies is probably not currently feasible in most Pacific Island
       Countries where they are not done now. International experience shows that levy systems
       require a sufficient formal industrial base to justify the costs, and good tax collection
       capabilities (to collect payroll levies). The fact that many Pacific Island Countries have
       large informal economies suggests not only that such a base probably does not exist,
       especially in the smaller Pacific Island Countries, but also that tax collection will be more
       problematic. Therefore, payroll-financed training levies targeting formal enterprises may
       not be the most suitable option for raising funds for TVET in these settings.

•      Tax incentives and education - Tax regulations and liabilities can affect companies’
       decision to train workers (OECD, 2014b); tax incentives (typically tax credits of tax
       allowances) can be used as a means to encourage company investment in staff training.
       However, international experience suggests that tax incentives are unlikely to work well
       in countries where formal industry is not welldeveloped (and where small enterprises
       make up a bulk of all private enterprises) and where administrative or organizational
       capacity is weak (including tax collection capability) (Dunbar, 2013; OECD, 2014b). This
       may imply that such approaches are not well suited to some EAP countries. However, it is
       a known mechanism already used in several EAP countries (e.g. China, Philippines,
       Thailand), from which lessons could be drawn.

•      Education and training leave in companies. Mechanisms that regulate periods of
       temporary leave (paid or unpaid) from the workplace for the purpose of education and
       training can encourage employee skill upgrading. Where a company gives paid leave to
       an employee to undertake training, they are making a direct financial contribution. Even


19
     The framework for this sub-section draws on Palmer (2015b).

                                                                                                 32
    where unpaid leave is granted, the company incurs indirect costs (as a result of the
    employee not being present and the possibility of having to pay for a temporary
    replacement). As with tax incentives, above, such a mechanism is less suited to small
    (informal) enterprises that cannot afford staff to take off such time. Nonetheless, for
    formal medium and large enterprises in EAP countries, introducing such regulations –
    where they don’t already exist – may be a useful step to take.

•   Training vouchers for companies. Grants allocated to companies in the form of
    vouchers, which part finance training, can be another mechanism to stimulate private
    sector investment in training. Training vouchers can be purchased by enterprises at a
    discounted price to introduce an element of ‘cost-sharing’; for example, a training
    voucher worth US$250 might be sold to companies for US$125. However, in the absence
    of targeting, such vouchers may simply be purchased by companies that would have paid
    full cost-recovery for training anyway.

•   Payback clauses to encourage enterprise-financed employee training. Payback
    clauses are essentially agreements between an employee and an employer regarding
    training that has been financed at the employer’s expense; the employee is obligated to
    stay with that company for a set period of time (e.g. 1-2 years) after completion of
    training, or else repay all or part of the cost of training. Again, a mechanism more suited
    to formal and larger companies.


Incentivizing private enterprises to contribute to overall TVET reform efforts

•   Stimulating in-kind private sector resources. Marshalling in-kind private sector
    resources for TVET may be another option for governments to explore.
     For example, the involvement of the private sector:
        - on TVET institutional boards;
        - in (establishing) sector skills councils and TVET coordination bodies;
        - in helping to define curricula and determine skill needs;
        - with regard to offering internships, apprenticeships or other work placements for
            both students and staff of TVET institutes.

•   Private sector corporate social responsibility towards TVET. Tapping into company
    corporate social responsibility agreements might be one way to access corporate grants
    for TVET from large formal companies. For those EAP countries with extensive natural
    resources (e.g. Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji), or where tourism revenue is relatively
    significant (e.g. Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia), there may be scope for such agreements
    including the requirement of private firms to support TVET providers within their sphere
    of operations (in cash or in kind).

•   Private investment in TVET capital projects. Private funding of capital projects for
    public TVET may be feasible in certain cases, if for example the new buildings have a
    specific income stream associated with them. Dormitory construction is a case in point, if
    students are to be charged economic rents (Horne, 2014).


Encouraging PPPs and the expansion of private provision

See above discussions.




                                                                                            33
Other approaches to mobilize non-state resources for TVET

•      Retention of internally generated funds at the level of the TVET institution – the sale
       goods and services, where revenue is retained is another viable option (see Palmer,
       2015b).

•      Supply-side financing through tuition fees – In many EAP countries it is noted that
       there is only limited scope to increase TVET funding through enrolment fees, and that
       doing so (in the absence of increased targeted financial support) would have negative
       equity implications for disadvantaged groups. However, in some countries this may be an
       option, provided that targeted needs based scholarships or stipends are provided for those
       that can’t pay. Where cost sharing is expanded, it has been noted that trainee interest in
       the quality, relevance and cost-effectiveness of training increases (ADB, 2004).




How can other countries create the right environment for
TVET financing?
TVET financing approaches don’t function in isolation of other TVET reform efforts and
governments need to create a conducive policy, regulatory and administrative climate in
which various financing mechanisms can function, and where private financing can flourish
alongside public financing. This includes (but is not limited to), for example:20

•      Establishing and strengthening national TVET coordination mechanisms , where they
       don’t exist, that can coordinate demand and supply, and financing mechanisms to achieve
       specified policy objectives.

•      Ensuring the private sector has control of allocating funds raised from private sector
       contributions. To crowd-in private sector financing, the private sector needs to be
       directly involved in creating a better system; e.g. in determining the allocation of funds
       raised (from private sector contributions), involvement in governance, in developing
       curriculum, in informing training provision.

•      Decentralizing governance of providers – where full decentralization is not possible,
       partial devolution, including for example the ability to retain self-generated revenue
       might be considered.

•      Strengthening TVET quality assurance and accreditation – needed to facilitate the
       functioning of some financing mechanisms (e.g. vouchers or allowing private provider to
       compete for public funds).

•      Improving TVET information systems – essential for most financing mechanisms, and
       needed in order to align funding to identified need. For example careful targeting of
       financing mechanisms at specific beneficiary groups can help to reduce the percentage of
       individuals or companies who would have taken the training anyway and paid for it
       themselves. For careful targeting to take place, it is essential to know which groups
       (categories of people or enterprises) are currently under-investing in training. Targeting
       does not only have to relate to which groups or categories of people or enterprises should

     From Palmer (2015a).

                                                                                              34
    be the priority, but it can also refer to which types of skills should be the priority. To
    know this, it is necessary to have adequate labour market information systems.

•   Improved tax collection systems - Tax collection capability is particularly important for
    payroll levies, income contingent loans, and tax incentives to companies and individuals.

Lastly, countries wishing to adopt various TVET financing mechanisms need to give
due consideration to their country’s historical, social and political contexts and assess
how these may act as enablers or barriers to the use of certain financing mechanisms.

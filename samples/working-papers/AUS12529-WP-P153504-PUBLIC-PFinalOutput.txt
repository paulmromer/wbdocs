  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Community of Practice – Interim Assessment
******************************************************************************
Background:

The EITI CoP was created two years ago, and the departure of the past Community Manager
warrants an assessment over what has been achieved so far, how successful the CoP was in the
goals stated in its charter, and how the CoP future should look like. Currently the CoP has 200
members, most of them in Africa and Asia, apart from the US and Europe. The graph below
shows that user activity has been stagnating since May 2015.




                   N.B.: User Adoption can only be traced back for one year.

Methodology:

The assessment of the EITI CoP is based on interviews with stakeholders and members, a
member satisfaction survey, review of the platform and documents such as its charter, as well
as the comparison to other CoPs.

Findings:

Given the amount of people that work in EITI, the potential is huge to foster mutual knowledge
sharing. The bank can convene these people and host the CoP since other institutions like the
secretariat don’t have the technological means (WebEx, C4D-platform). A consultant with
previous EITI knowledge who can identify and position topics, as well as a champion those
within the bank and support from the International Secretariat would be key for a successful
CoP
Potential value added of the EITI Community of Practice:
     The secretariat is in need of a low-cost option for training from Oslo and would like to
       use the CoP for this on topics such as beneficial ownership or contract transparency. The



Document of the World Bank
       member satisfaction survey stated that Webinars have been successful creating a
       demand for these and trainings.
      Create a one-stop-shop that compiles all other existing information in one place (i.e.
       EITI newsletter, link to NRGI portal, conference reports, etc.). This would facilitate the
       onboarding of new members to MSG groups when these rotate by serving as an
       institutional memory. Eddy Rich from the International Secretariat doubted that the WB
       could be a one-stop-shop for EITI.
      Use the platform to engage members in a broader agenda of topics going beyond the
       standard, such as the EI value chain, fiscal modelling, or World Bank procurement rules.
      Serve as a bottom-up mutual learning forum for EITI implementers that can create
       knowledge regarding questions such as “how to build a coalition around EITI? and other
       implementation issues. There is a significant number of member requests to join the
       CoP indicating its value.
A number of knowledge sharing initiatives already exists for EITI:

      A monthly EITI newsletter from the secretariat that shares success stories of countries,
       general updates and other information
      Regional meetings, regional coordinators plus the global conference, all of which
       enhance best-practice sharing, mutual learning, etc.
      The EITI-structure has a clear focal point with the secretariat in Oslo and established
       communication channels, e.g. for technical questions regarding the standard.
      An internal Yammer-group (similar to the C4D-platform) for communications people,
       EITI information on GOXI, and a very well-prepared NRGI info-portal on implementing
       EITI, which translates the standard into easily digestible policy actions

Obstacles to a vibrant community:

      The secretariat (Eddie Rich) states that the World Bank hosting an EITI CoP is
       counterintuitive, and potentially harmful if advice given within the forum is not
       interpreted correctly and thus a country does not pass validation because of incorrect
       knowledge.
      The target group (government officials, many in low-income countries) are the hardest
       group to engage online, and logging on to the C4D-platform is an obstacle that makes it
       difficult to log on.
      Language and time-zone heterogeneity, much more pronounced than in the case of LC
      Unlike GOXI, establishment of the CoP initially supply-driven without needs-assessment
Conclusions:

There are two options:

   1. Hire a new CoP manager full-time (150 days) to manage and refocus the CoP on areas
      where the bank has a comparative advantage and can add value, in close coordination
      with the International Secretariat. This would be based on the demand from the
      International Secretariat to use the CoP for trainings, the success of and demand for
      trainings and webinars, and the potential for an EITI one-stop-shop. Crucial for a thriving
      community would be senior support in the World Bank and the International
      Secretariat, as well as a proactive consultant with previous EITI knowledge.

   2. Close the CoP (i.e. leave it in place but discontinue the technical support). This option
      would be based on the existing communication and knowledge sharing channels,
      technical and language barriers that impinge on the CoPs potential, as well as the
      secretariat’s view that the World Bank is not the most intuitive host for an EITI
      knowledge exchange forum.

Identified at least 2 areas where CoP can add value for the secretariat:
   - Low cost option for giving seminars and trainings via WebEx & CoP
   - How do you view the CoP
   - Most certainly will hire new CoP manager, will send ToRs to secretariat

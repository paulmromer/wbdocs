ABSTRACT
Tobacco taxes are usually considered regressive as the poorest indi-
viduals allocate larger shares of their budget towards the purchase
of tobacco related products. However, because these taxes also
discourage tobacco use, some of the most adverse effects and their
economic costs are reduced, including lower life expectancy at birth,
higher medical expenses, increased years of disability among smokers,
and the effects of secondhand smoke. This paper projects the effects
of an increase in the tobacco tax on household welfare in Ukraine.
It considers three price-elasticity scenarios among income deciles
of the population. Results show that although tobacco taxes are often
criticized for being regressive in the short-run, a more comprehensive
scenario that includes medical expenses and working years, the bene-
fits of tobacco taxes far exceed the increase in tax liability, benefitting
in large measure lower income households. Our results also indicate
that lower health expenditure seems to be the main driver because
of the reduction in tobacco-related diseases that require expensive
treatments. Tobacco taxes are also associated with positive distri-
butional effects related to the higher long-term price elasticities of
tobacco consumption.

    INTRODUCTION
    On December 19, 2016, the Ukrainian Parliament approved the 2017 budget, which
    includes a specific excise tax on tobacco products that represents a 40 percent increase
    over the corresponding tax in 2016, while maintaining a 12 percent ad valorem tax.
    Because low-income families usually allocate a larger proportion of their budgets to
    purchase tobacco products and alcoholic beverages, the tax increase would seem to be
    a regressive policy at first glance. However, a closer look reveals that the expected over-
    all reduction in tobacco consumption2 associated with the tax increase would -in the
    long run- reduce the adverse effects of tobacco consumption, including higher medical
    expenditures and added years of disability among smokers, the negative effect on life
    expectancy at birth, reductions in the quality of life, and numerous negative externalities
    among first- and secondhand smokers, thus benefiting former smokers and their families.
    Meanwhile, a boost in government revenue (paid by those who continue to smoke) ear-
    marked toward providing social transfers (such as health care or pensions) could further
    lever the benefits of a tobacco taxation for the poorest households. The increase in the
    tobacco tax and the subsequent reduction of tobacco consumption could therefore
    result in potential measurable benefits for different income groups.

    This paper describes and quantifies the effects of tobacco tax increases on aggregate
    household welfare through three channels. Channel (1) implies that higher tobacco
    prices due to higher taxes induce behavioral response in the means of a reduction on
    tobacco consumption.3 The reduction in consumption is then associated with (2) a
    reduction in medical expenses, and (3) a rise in income because of the gain in years of
    employment. To assess the impact of these effects, this paper estimates the price elastic-
    ity of tobacco, simulates upper- and lower-bound scenarios, and calculates the welfare
    gains among various population income groups.

    There is ample and robust evidence linking tobacco consumption with health-related
    problems.[1, 2] Diseases associated with tobacco use range from lung cancer to stroke
    and even to congenital malformation in children.[3] In 2010, 7 million early deaths were
    attributed to tobacco consumption globally.[4] Today, more than 80 percent of the
    world’s smokers live in low- and middle-income countries, harming health, incomes,
    earning potential, and labor productivity and undermining human capital accumulation,



    2
     Most importantly, the number of people who quit smoking or do not start at all.
    3
     This reduction in tobacco consumption is manifested through the set of people that discontinue smoking, and in the long run,
    younger individuals that do not start smoking at all.

which is critical to sustainable economic growth and social development.[5] In Ukraine,
85,000 deaths are attributed to tobacco consumption yearly.[6] Evidence linking tobacco
and health problems has triggered important policy shifts among international organi-
zations and policy makers alike, leading to more rigorous restrictions and taxation on the
sale and use of tobacco.

Accordingly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has made the reduction of tobacco
consumption one of its primary goals, thus promoting tobacco monitoring, smoke-free
policies, smoking-cessation support programs, relevant health advice, advisory deter-
rents, and taxation policies.[7] Among strategies, the tobacco tax seems to be one of the
most efficient measures for reducing tobacco consumption and has the added benefit of
raising government revenue.[8] The inelastic demand of some tobacco consumers is use-
ful in increasing tax revenues, and the higher price elasticity of younger smokers makes
the tax an efficient consumption deterrent in the long run.[8, 9]

A recurrent concern is the potential regressivity of tobacco taxes because low-income
households allocate larger shares of their budget to purchase tobacco products relative
to richer households. Nonetheless, in this paper we show that, if indirect (health) effects
are included in the calculations, the concern about tobacco tax policies is no longer valid.
Instead, the future benefits of nonsmoking outweigh the losses attributed to tobacco
taxes among the population in general and among low-income groups specifically.[10, 11]

Beyond short-term reductions in household tobacco expenditures, the possible benefits
of tobacco tax policies include lower medical expenditures and more healthy life years,
both of which could translate into accountable economic benefits that more than offset
the losses generated by tax increases when consumers discontinue -or never start- smok-
ing. To test these hypotheses, a social welfare framework is used to calculate the effects
on various income groups and different price elasticities for tobacco consumption are
estimated. To establish a contextual background, section 2 briefly reviews the litera-
ture on the health effects of tobacco, tobacco policies, and price elasticities. Section 3
describes the methodology, parameters, and data used to forecast the impact of the
tobacco tax. Section 4 presents the estimation results, and section 5 concludes with a
discussion on policy implications.

    THE LITERATURE

    a. Tobacco and health
    During the last century, about 100 million deaths were related to tobacco use.[13]
    If current trends were to remain constant, about 1 billion people could die from tobacco-
    related diseases during this century.[14] In Ukraine, 7.2 million adults consume tobacco
    every day, and, in 2010, over 85,000 deaths were attributed to tobacco consumption.4[15]

    According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, tobacco consumption
    is responsible or contributes to many types of cancers, including lung, oral, laryngeal,
    pancreatic, kidney, cervical, and acute myeloid leukemia.[3] Smoking is related to respira-
    tory problems such as chronic respiratory symptoms, tuberculosis, influenza, pneumonia,
    other infections, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. It is also associated with
    cardiovascular diseases, such as aneurysms, stroke, and coronary heart disease, as well
    as adverse reproductive and developmental effects, such as low birthweight, congen-
    ital malformation in babies, and complications in pregnancy, along with male sexual
    dysfunction.[3, 14] The exposure to secondhand smoke has a causal relationship with
    many respiratory diseases in children and adults. There are more than 4,000 chemicals in
    tobacco smoke (of which at least 250 are harmful and more than 50 can cause cancer).
    Although the nature of the causal relationship between secondhand smoke and cancer
    or its impact on reproduction is not clear, research has strongly connected them.[3,16]
    Moreover, according to the WHO, secondhand smoke is responsible for over 600,000
    premature deaths worldwide.


    b. Tobacco control policies
    Globally, antitobacco policies include smoking prohibition in specific locations and com-
    pletely smoke-free environments, advertising to deter tobacco use, smoking cessation
    programs, prohibitions on tobacco sales close to schools, and taxation. These various
    policies have shown diverse effects in tobacco use, tobacco availability and secondhand
    smoke exposure among the population.

    WHO argues that entirely smoke-free environments, rather than separate smoking rooms
    or good ventilation systems, are the only way to prevent the harmful consequences of
    secondhand tobacco smoke.[5] Smoke-free laws are popular because there is evidence

that they improve health outcomes without affecting business. In 2016, these laws ben-
efited 19 percent of the world's population.[7] The benefits depended on the breadth of
the legislation. For example, prohibiting smoking in all indoor workplaces reduced the
exposure to secondhand smoke by 80 percent–90 percent and decreased the incidence
of acute respiratory illness (IARC 2009).

In 2016, about 33 percent of the world's population had access to smoking cessation sup-
port programs, 21 percent more than in 2012.[7] These programs represent the fifth most
widespread policy in the world.[5] They significantly raise quitting rates among smokers
who want to quit and are more cost-effective compared with other health care programs.
[17] Although they are effective, they only treat those addicted individuals who want to
be treated. Their presence is also associated with country income, and they are mainly
found in high-income countries.

Another way to discourage tobacco consumption is through health warning labels on
tobacco packages. This is the third most common policy against cigarettes in the world.
In 2016, almost 45 percent of the world’s population was being exposed to such labeling.
Warning labels are widely supported by the public and may not represent a cost to gov-
ernments.[5] However, they have to be regularly updated and changed to remain impact-
ful. The use of warnings may influence people against tobacco consumption; however,
their use only accounts for a marginal decrease.[18–20]

Mass media campaigns that reach large populations represent the most popular and
common way to combat tobacco use. In 2016, such campaigns addressed 56 percent of
the world's population. People in low-income countries are less likely to be exposed to
these campaigns. However, there is limited information about the cost-effectiveness of
this approach.[5] Durkin, Brennan, and Wakefield (2012) conclude that mass media aware-
ness programs could promote quitting; however, their impact depends on the duration
of the campaigns, especially among low-income smokers. It also depends on the mes-
sage; information about the adverse health risks of smoking represents the most efficient
means to reach users.[21]

In Ukraine, several tobacco control policies have been adopted in the last years. In 2005,
the Law on Measures to Prevent and Reduce the Use of Tobacco Products and their
Harmful Impact on the Health of the Population was adopted. On 15 March 2006, Parlia-
ment ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), implemented
fully on September 4, 2006 .[22]

According to the WHO Reports on the global tobacco epidemic, between the Second
(survey data collected in 2006 or earlier) and the Third Reports (survey data collected
in 2009 or earlier), Ukraine has demonstrated one of the fastest declines in smoking
prevalence in the world: age and sex standardized current tobacco smoking prevalence
declined from 45% to 32%. Per the national reports, daily smoking prevalence in Ukraine


8 // The Literature
decreased from 37.2% in 2005 to 25.5% in 2010. Ukraine has followed best international
tobacco control practices, but the success has been achieved without governmental funding
for tobacco control activities. Ukraine has almost not used those strategies which require
even moderate national resources like quit lines or other cessation services. The decline in
smoking prevalence hence potentially resulted from the tobacco control legislation first
adopted in 2005 and amended later, which included extension of smoke free policies;
step-by-step tobacco advertising bans; large health warnings and other measures; however,
most of these policies were implemented between 2005 and 2007.[23]

Those legislative measures which came into force in late 2012 including (1) tobacco adver-
tising ban — on September 16, 2012, (2) introduction of large (50% of the pack surface area)
graphic health warning on tobacco packaging — on October 4, 2012, (3) smoke-free policies
in restaurants and other public and workplaces — on December 16, 2012, have resulted in
significant decrease of cigarette sales in Ukraine in 2013.[24]


c. Tobacco taxes
Prohibiting certain practices (e.g., tobacco marketing or indoor smoking) has a limited effect
because after such practices are prohibited, they cannot be prohibited further. Increases
in tobacco excise taxes are not subject to such constraints; excise taxes can continue to be
increased, even if the tax rate is already very high.[25] Tobacco taxation is considered one
of the most efficient measures to reduce tobacco consumption; as a secondary benefit,
they also increase government revenue.5[8] Because both effects are desirable from a pol-
icy standpoint, the use of taxes is considered to be economically justified. Additionally, the
higher price elasticity of young people makes taxes a good way to fight tobacco use because
taxes will significantly reduce consumption in the long run.

Institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB 2010), WHO (2008), the
International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC 2011), and the World Bank (1999) and
authors such as Levy et al. (2014) have associated price increases with significant declines in
tobacco consumption.[8,26–29] These authors, as well as the WHO, estimate that higher taxes
are responsible for almost half the decline in smoking.[30] However, the effects of these pol-
icies mainly depend on the type of taxes. For example, ad valorem taxes are based on prices;
so, tobacco companies can potentially avoid higher taxes by cutting on providers and setting
lower prices. For this reason, consumption levels and tax revenue depend on the industry
pricing strategy. Alternatively, specific excise taxes establish a fixed tax amount, although the
tax amount must be adjusted periodically for inflation to accomplish their mission and are
associated with the risk of encouraging contraband sales.[5] The taxation system in Ukraine,
as in other countries, uses both types of tobacco taxes, that is, specific and ad valorem excise.


5
 Tobacco tax increases have also been associated with a rise in contraband and illegal tobacco sales, reducing the expected increase in
government revenue (Jha and Chaloupka 2000) [56]

d. The price elasticity of tobacco consumption
The extent of price elasticity is crucial in calibrating the effect of taxation systems because
it determines the sensitivity of demand to a change in tobacco prices. In general, tax
increases generate larger shifts of tobacco purchase and consumption among low- and
middle-income populations than in high-income groups (WHO 2015a). [5]

There is an extensive literature estimating the relationship between tobacco prices and
consumption. Guindon (2013) provides a broad review of 26 international studies; a few
should be mentioned directly.[31] Chaloupka and Grossman (1981) and Lewit and Coate
(1981) estimate the elasticity among the under-18 population in the United States at,
respectively, −1.44 and −1.31.[33, 34] Among adults ages 18 years or older, Chaloupka
(1991) and Lewit and Coate (1981) estimate the elasticity in the United States at between
−0.27 and −0.42, respectively.[34, 35] For all 52 countries in the European region, Gallus
et al. (2006) estimate a price elasticity of −0.46 using national yearly aggregated data.[35]
For Hungary, the price elasticity is estimated at between −0.44 and −0.37 and, for the
United Kingdom, at −0.5.[37, 38] For Poland and Turkey, tobacco price elasticities have
been estimated at, respectively, −0.4 and −0.19 in the short run (−0.7 for long-run elastic-
ity in Poland).[39, 40] For India, cigarette price elasticities have been estimated for differ-
ent income groups, finding −0.83 and −0.26 for the lowest and highest income groups,
respectively.[40] For South Africa, Van Walbeek (2002) estimates prices elasticities for
different income quintiles, controlling for income changes, and finds elasticities of −1.39
and −0.81 for the poorest and richest income quintile, respectively.[41] For Taiwan, China,
price elasticities of tobacco have been estimated at −0.29.[42]

Research conducted in such countries as USA, UK, Canada, Bangladesh, China, and Indo-
nesia has indicated that smoking prevalence among men and women in lower socioeco-
nomic groups is more responsive to the changes in cigarette prices; however, in countries
such as Egypt, Bulgaria, and Turkey the evidence is mixed [IARC 2011]. In Ukraine, we see
little difference in response to sharp price increase among different SES groups in short-
term perspective, while in medium-term perspective (5 years) tobacco tax hikes have
higher impact on smoking prevalence rates among younger and poorer.[23]

There are two important factors involved in determining tobacco price elasticities:
income and age. People in low-income groups have more elastic demands relative to
medium- and higher-income groups.[14] At the same time, younger groups in popula-
tions are more responsive to price and thus tax increases because they tend to be less
nicotine dependent, more affected by peer effects, and possess less disposable income.
[14] Studies in the United States have consistently shown that younger groups have
higher elasticities relative to older groups.[32,33,43]




10 // The Literature
e. Further costs of tobacco: life, work, and medical expenses
The major costs of tobacco consumption beyond the direct price are associated with
public and private health care costs. Tobacco-related health care costs can be either
direct or indirect. Direct costs include the monetary value of the consumption of goods
and services motivated and, in many cases, compelled because of tobacco use. These are
divided into health care costs (hospitalization, medication, medical supplies, equipment,
and so on) and non–health care costs (job replacements for sick smokers, insurance,
cleaning up the cigarette ash and stubs, packaging, and smoke residue of smokers, and
so on). Goodchild et al. (2016) estimate that the global economic cost of tobacco-related
diseases is equivalent to 1.8 percent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).[57] For
the United States, the direct health care costs associated with tobacco-related diseases
are estimated at 1.1 percent of GDP or 8.7 percent of annual health care spending.6[44]
Meanwhile, the indirect costs include the loss of productivity because of lost working
days related to smoking illnesses and the value of the lives prematurely lost. Both effects
are incorporated in the disability-adjusted life years indicator.[45]

Focusing on health care costs, Lightwood et al. (2000) estimate the cost of tobacco
use. They suggest that the gross health care cost in high-income countries fluctuates
between 0.1 percent and 1.0 percent of GDP.[46] In terms of price elasticities, limited data
inhibit accurate estimates in low- and middle-countries, but the authors argue that the
price elasticity could be as high as those in high-income countries. Meanwhile, Verguet
et al. (2015) analyze the health effects of a price increase in China.[12] Their research
concludes that a 50 percent rise in prices would result in 231 million years of life gained
over 50 years, with a significant impact in the lowest income quintile. Pichón-Riviere et al.
(2014) estimate that tobacco use in Chile will reduce life expectancy by nearly 4.0 years
among women and 4.3 years among men.[47] There would also be about 379,000 life
days lost, which is more than a thousand years.7

The research represented in this paper takes advantage of the current literature on health
care costs. It draws information and ideas from Marquez et al. (2017) and others who
estimate the long-term health care costs of tobacco in Ukraine and adds new estimates
and measures of the incidence of disease and of income distribution.[54] From a meth-
odological standpoint, this paper follows the methods described by Fuchs and Meneses
(2017).[48]




6
 Estimated cost US$169.3 billion divided by GDP (2010); US$14.96 trillion equals 1.13 percent.
7
 Days lost refer to years of life lost (YLL) because of premature mortality. Another indicator is years lost because of disability (YLD)
among people living with poor health and its consequences. Usually disability-adjusted life years = YLL + YLD.



                                                                                                                                           11
Regressive or Progressive? The Effect of Tobacco Taxes in Ukraine




f. Costs and benefits that are not included
Some well-researched costs and benefits are not covered in this paper. Secondhand
smoke has been shown to be an important societal cost of smoking, affecting the health
of adults and children.[49] In one example, from the state of Indiana, the health-related
costs of secondhand smoke have been estimated at more than US$1.3 billion yearly,
US$201 per-capita. However, this paper does not include the cost of secondhand smoke
in the analysis because of the lack of detailed information required about smoking within
households or the workplace.

As discussed earlier, one potential channel in which tobacco taxes can improve income
inequality is the possible use of tax revenues on progressive policies such as direct
income transfers or services. These policies might involve expansions in health care, social
welfare, and education expenditures. Although earmarking tax revenues for specific
projects -such as health care, social welfare or education- is a common practice in some
countries, this paper does not include them in the assessment as they depend on a myr-
iad of factors that include political decisions. Therefore, this paper covers only benefits
that directly arise from tobacco tax policy.

b. Elasticity calculations
To enhance the analysis, tobacco price elasticities are estimated using the household
budget survey, 2010–13. The declared prices paid by households and the quantities of
cigarettes purchased are used; this allows the calculation of a measure of effective price
per cigarette, considering brand pricing variability. Figure 1 shows the variation in the
price of cigarettes estimated using the household survey and the changes in prices using
national statistical data on Ukraine. As expected, the variation in the prices paid by house-
holds reflect price variations between filtered and nonfiltered cigarettes, showing that
households adjust consumption budgets as prices change.

Once a measure of the price of cigarettes in Ukraine is obtained, the tobacco price elas-
ticity across population groups is estimated (refer to Appendix I for more details). Table
2 shows the tobacco price elasticity across income deciles and other subgroups in the
population: total population, household heads ages 25–40, and household location (rural
versus urban).

                       Estimates of the average tobacco price elasticity of −0.45 are higher than those calculated
                       by Krasovsky et al. (2002) for Ukraine (-.25). To incorporate different assumptions of price
                       elasticities, lower-bound and upper-bound elasticities are simulated. These estimates
                       show differences between −0.2 and +0.2 relative to the previously estimated elastici-
                       ties. The lower-bound elasticities are similar to Krasovsky et al. (2002) and tend to reflect
                       income groups that typically do not change patterns of consumption, such as rural resi-
                       dents or older population groups. These groups tend to exhibit less change in consump-
                       tion when prices change.

The upper-bound elasticity tends to reflect a longer-term scenario, echoing the effect the
tobacco tax would have on younger smokers (table 3). After a few decades, these people
will represent the majority of the population as older smokers die or quit smoking. The
total average effect of the price increase over the long term would therefore be approxi-
mated more closely by the upper-bound price elasticity.

Once changes in tobacco expenditure due to price increases are calculated, we proceed
to calculate the incidence of tobacco consumption on medical treatments, lost years
of work, and related costs. Denisova and Kuznetsova (2014) estimate the incidence of
tobacco on medical spending. As a secondary source of information, the Ukrainian gov-
ernment and WHO have estimated the disease prevalence in each age-group and the
monetary cost of treatment. This information allows a calculation of the average cost of
medical treatment for each disease. The cost of lost years of employment can be esti-
mated using the household consumption survey (see below).


c. Mortality age patterns
Early mortality related to tobacco consumption is analyzed to obtain the elasticities. Med-
ical events associated with tobacco show a strong relationship with age and the number
of years of smoking. Table 4 illustrates age patterns in tobacco-related deaths. Lost years
of life are distributed among households as the using the proportion of households that
have smokers, and the income (or wages) of this population segment is used to estimate
the working years lost.

d. Cost of treatment
To estimate the medical costs of tobacco consumption, tobacco-related medical treat-
ments and deaths are examined. The Ukrainian Department of Health Statistics and
Information provides information on mortality related to tobacco consumption for 2013.
As a second source of information, the total number of tobacco-related events are also
obtained from Denisova and Kuznetsova (2014) (see table 4).13

Once the estimates of the number of deaths and the incidence of other events have been
calculated, we investigate the medical treatments costs for each of these diseases. Table 5
shows estimates of the average cost of medical treatment for tobacco-related diseases in
Ukraine. These expenses refer to the cost of treatment incurred by the state and excludes
the costs to users. Although Ukraine has an extensive public health care system, not all
medical costs are covered by the state. According to the National Health Accounts of
Ukraine in 2015, out-of-pocket expenses accounted for 40.5 percent of all medical costs
in Ukraine. This cost is covered directly by user expenditures. These costs usually consist
of the inputs, medicines, and pharmaceutical components of the treatment. The estimate
of the cost of treatment of these diseases therefore includes out-of-pocket expenditures
calculated at 40.5 percent of the total expenditure.




13
  Although determining the exact cause of each particular disease is not possible, the medical community has agreed on the prob-
abilities of disease occurrence by age, gender, and tobacco consumption. The resulting tables of probabilities, along with tobacco
incidence, are used to estimate the deaths related to tobacco.

Table 6 shows the annual medical costs of tobacco-related mortality. The results are taken
from calculations based on the data in tables 4 and 5. After calculating the costs related
to diseases, the cost of the treatment of illnesses that are related to tobacco consumption
are calculated (table 7). Cardiovascular diseases, cardiovascular surgeries, other respiratory
diseases (pneumonia and bronchitis), other cancers, and tuberculosis are included as
major causes of the costs associated with medical care. Data on these costs have been
collected based on various academic, national, and international sources.

Regressive or Progressive? The Effect of Tobacco Taxes in Ukraine




The total estimated out-of-pocket cost of tobacco is over US$90 million, similar to the esti-
mates of the government costs calculated by Denisova and Kuznetsova (2014).


e. Summary of descriptive statistics
Table 8 summarizes the most important indicators, including total monthly expenditure
from the household consumption survey and the incidence of household tobacco pur-
chases. The cost of the medical treatment of tobacco-related diseases is estimated as a
proportion of monthly income for each income decile. The share of income lost because
of years of employment lost resulting from tobacco-related mortality is then estimated.

                        RESULTS
                        The three scenarios in the tobacco price elasticity, lower bound, medium bound, and
                        upper bound, are presented in table 3. These three scenarios allow an understanding of
                        the ways results could change under different assumptions.


                        a. Tobacco price increase
                        As a first step, the income changes for each income decile arising from the increase in
                        tobacco prices are estimated based on low-, medium-, and upper-bound elasticity. Using
                        equation (4) and tables 3 and 8, one can calculate the effects of the tobacco price increase.
                        For example, given the lower-bound elasticity (−0.39) in table 3, the proportion of tobacco
                        expenditure among the first decile (2.5 percent) in table 8, and a price increase of 25 per-
                        cent, there was increased expenditure of 0.32 percent. This represents a loss in welfare
                        among consumers because they have to devote a higher proportion of their incomes to
                        purchase the same amount of tobacco and reduce their consumption of other goods. The
                        results for all income deciles and elasticity scenarios are shown in table 9.

Sources: Proportion of household budget. Based on data of the 2013 household budget survey.
Note: The table shows the share of total household budget for each decile. Complete pass-through refers to elasticity equal to
zero; consumers pay all the increased prices.



                        Across the three elasticities, the direct effect of the tobacco tax is a welfare loss, but
                        in none of the cases does the shock seem to be regressive. In the low-, medium-, and
                        upper-bound elasticity scenarios, the effect of the price increase is progressive, affecting
                        higher-income groups in a higher proportion (figure 3). To show the effect of the elas-
                        ticities on prices, table 9 includes the estimates of a complete pass-through scenario,
                        whereby the increase in prices is completely passed to consumers without a reduction in
                        consumption. Only in this case is the price shock regressive, affecting the lower-income
                        deciles to a greater degree.


                                                                                                                                          27

     b. Medical expenses
     The yearly medical costs associated with tobacco consumption are estimated, assuming
     a direct medical impact on health. Although this assumption is unrealistic in the short
     run, the long-run reduction of tobacco consumption would tend to behave according to
     this pattern, whereby a reduction in tobacco consumption would be strongly related to
     a reduction in tobacco-related diseases and thus a reduction in medical costs (table 10).
     Health care expenditures are estimated using equation (5) and tables 3 and 8.

     28 // Results
  The reduction in tobacco consumption would have a positive effect on income through
  reduced medical treatments. The saving in expenditure iwould vary between 0.43 and
  0.02 percentage points of the household income in the case of the lower-bound elasticity
  assumption, between 0.64 and 0.06 percentage points in the case of the medium-bound
  elasticity, and between 0.86 and 0.1 percentage points in the case of the upper-bound
  elasticity (figure 4). These results show the importance of the elasticity assumptions; they
  also stress the relevance of the possible elasticity variations across income groups.

  c. Income gains because of increased years of employment
  The cost of working life lost because of tobacco consumption is estimated based on

  increase on the increase in the years of employment. For example, in the first decile, assum-

  The results show that the reduction in tobacco consumption and the expected increase in
  years of potential work have positive impacts on welfare. In the first scenario, the gains are
  evenly distributed across income deciles. However, elasticities vary across deciles, generat-
  ing an important impact on lower-income groups (figure 5).

                         Once the effects of tobacco tax policy on prices, medical expenditures, and increased
                         years of employment are calculated separately, one may examine the bigger picture.
                         Based on a lower-bound elasticity, the results show a mixed effect of tobacco tax policy.
                         The effect is progressive in that it has a smaller impact on the lower-income groups of the
                         population relative to the higher-income groups, but the overall effect is negative (table
                         12; figure 6). Apparently, a population that is not as sensitive to tobacco price changes
                         will not reduce consumption sufficiently to allow health and work benefits to offset cost
                         increases. This is exactly what happens in Ukraine.

Regressive or Progressive? The Effect of Tobacco Taxes in Ukraine




In the case of a medium-bound elasticity, the tax has a progressive impact because of a
positive effect on lower-income groups and a negative effect on higher-income groups.
In the case of the upper-bound elasticity, the tax would have positive and progressive
distributional effects, benefiting lower-income groups in larger proportion and having a
negative effect on the highest income decile. Although this effect is driven mostly by the
elasticity variance among income deciles, the elasticity level is also relevant. The tax would
have a positive effect on most income groups, but also show a progressive pattern, that is,
greater benefits for lower-income groups.

In conclusion, under a low tobacco price elasticity scenario, the overall effect is negative
for all income groups. In the medium-bound scenario, the results are mixed, being posi-
tive among lower-income groups and negative outcomes among higher-income groups.
In the case of an upper-bound elasticity scenario, there would be income gains among
the first eight deciles of the population, and a progressive pattern. Moreover, the impact
would be particularly important among lower-income deciles. Furthermore, the assump-
tions in this model do not include other possible policies, such as smoking cessation pro-
grams, antismoking advertising, youth outreach, or policies financed through the new tax
revenue. Therefore, these results are in line with the literature, showing the important role
that taxation plays in lowering tobacco usage.

    DISCUSSION
    There has been extensive research on the negative effects of tobacco consumption on
    health and well-being, as well as the benefits of various public policy mechanisms aimed
    at reducing tobacco use. One of the most efficient ways to deter tobacco use is the imple-
    mentation of taxes, both ad valorem and specific excise taxes. However, questions remain
    regarding the net positive effect of these policies and whether tobacco tax increases end
    up hurting poorer people more, as they happen to be more likely to smoke, to have poor
    health and less access to insurance and adequate treatment. The question of regressive
    taxation is particularly important because the welfare effects derived from increased taxes
    heavily depend on the price elasticity of this item across different sectors of the population.
    Price elasticity will determine the magnitude of the income shock, as well as the benefits
    gained because of the reduction in tobacco consumption.

    Much of the net welfare gain occurs through the reduction in medical costs and the
    increase in potential working years associated with good health, an effect of lower levels
    of tobacco consumption. If a tax merely raise prices without reducing purchased quantity,
    it would fail to be an effective policy. Thus, it is critical to understand the effects of these
    sort of policies by determining the aggregate welfare gains or losses generated. A respon-
    sible and comprehensive policy analysis should focus on poorer groups because consump-
    tion taxes can be regressive and because the poor are also more likely to smoke. One of the
    main motivations of this paper is to weigh the main costs and benefits of tobacco taxation
    to determine if, in the end, the policy is regressive or not.

    Results show that -when considered by itself- a price increase on tobacco through higher
    taxes would lead to slight tobacco expenditure increases across all population groups
    simply because of the higher price effect. This effect is more accentuated under the low-
    er-bound elasticity scenario and more moderate as elasticity increases in absolute terms.
    Conversely, a more comprehensive approach -including benefits through lower medical
    expenses and an increase in potential working years- the short-term tax burden is more
    than compensated. The tax increase shows a progressive pattern in all cases, though the
    absolute benefits vary. The reduction in medical expenses is the main driver of the increase
    in net incomes because of the reduction in tobacco-related problems, which require
    expensive treatments. In all three scenarios based on elasticity, the benefits of the reduced
    medical costs are greater, particularly among lower-income groups. This is because of the
    lower income. Assuming that medical expenses are constant across all population groups,
    the income increases are less among lower-income groups.




                                                                                                       35
Regressive or Progressive? The Effect of Tobacco Taxes in Ukraine




The various elasticity assumptions produce three distinct set of results. The lower-bound
elasticity creates losses among most income groups, but follows a somewhat progressive
pattern. The medium-bound and upper-bound elasticities lead to income gains among
lower-income groups, but losses among higher-income groups. Thus, the effect of tobacco
taxes on the various income groups is exacerbated if the variation in price elasticities across
income deciles is greater. In all three scenarios, the taxes have a progressive effect on
income distribution.

The three price elasticity scenarios mimic the short- versus the long-term effects of a
tobacco tax. There is evidence that adult smokers will only present small changes in their
behavior if faced with price increases; the lower-bound elasticity is likely to measure this
situation. In contrast, younger people usually show more elastic demand, that is, demand
that is similar to the upper-bound elasticity. After a few decades, one may expect the
impact of the tax policy to resemble the upper-bound elasticity scenario, as young people
replace older groups in the population.

The results provide evidence that support possible preservation or increase in tobacco
taxes. The analysis also shows the importance of tobacco price elasticity in assessing the
potential effect of this type of public policy. Specifically, this paper suggests that taxation,
especially in the short run when price elasticity is lower, should be accompanied by other
policies to deter smoking, such as smoking cessation programs or mass media campaigns
on the negative effects of tobacco use. Because the effect of and reaction to price changes
differ across income groups, specific policies should be targeted at different groups, but
focus on low-income households. For example, smoking cessation programs, which tend
to be expensive and less accessible to those with fewer resources, could be made more
accessible to lower-income groups, along with targeted advertising specifically adapted to
different sociocultural contexts. Overall, an integrated policy approach that involves coordi-
nation between taxation and behavior change may be the most effective, especially in the
short term, while price elasticities are still low. Further research should focus on which
combination of public policies is most (cost) effective across income and age-groups, given
that price elasticities differ across the population. Future research on the new Ukrainian
tobacco tax should also allow for analysis on how price elasticities change in the real world.

Repeated cross section estimation of elasticities versus panel data has been discussed in the literature, and
using subgroups of the population, and following them, has been recalled as pseudo-panel data approach.
These methodology has been used to estimate price elasticities for products like alcohol or cars.[54,55]. For a

                        APPENDIX II
                        We estimate the model for four specific groups of the population: rural, urban, population
                        under 40 years old, and over 40 years old. For the elasticities estimated for these popula-
                        tions (in Table A1), the mean results are as follows. We can see that that for most income
                        groups of the rural population, the effect of the tobacco tax is negative, but the effect
                        is still progressive. On the other hand, for urban as well as for households with heads of
                        young age, the effects tend to be positive as well as progressive.

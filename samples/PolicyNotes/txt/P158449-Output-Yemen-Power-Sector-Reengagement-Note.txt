1. Background

1. Already before the conflict, much of Yemen’s population was deprived of basic
   electricity services. Even before the conflict, Yemen was considered the least electrified
   country in the MENA region, with a pre-crisis access rate from all sources of only 55
   percent. The country’s per capita electricity consumption stood at 243 kWh in 2013,
   almost one-sixth of the regional average (The World Bank Group, 2016). Electricity
   supply and demand were seriously out of balance. Installed generation capacity was
   about 1,300 MW in 2015—20% short of peak demand—giving only about half the
   population access to (often unreliable) electricity. The remainder of the population
   lacked any form of electricity access, with severe consequences for socioeconomic
   development and poverty.

2. There had been little progress in the electricity sector over the last decade. The sector
   made little progress on improving operational efficiency and quality of service or in
   reducing high electricity losses, while costing the country over 10 percent of its GDP
   annually through direct and indirect subsidies (The World Bank, 2013). The country was
   neither getting the affordable, reliable and sufficient electricity needed to power
   economic growth, nor was it able to sustainably increase electricity service to more rural
   areas for poverty reduction. No major infrastructure was completed in the electricity
   sector since the gas-fired Marib power plant, which was contracted in 2005 and came
   online in 2009 (The World Bank, 2013). With the exception of the Marib plant, all
   electricity was generated by old and inefficient HFO/diesel fired plants owned by the
   Public Electricity Corporation (PEC) and small diesel units contracted through short-term
   rentals with the private suppliers. In 2010, HFO and diesel fired-power plants accounted
   for about 70 percent of grid-connected generation. In addition, there are millions of
   small diesel units owned by industry, commercial establishments and households to
   combat the frequent blackouts of the lack of access to the grid-connected electricity.
   The key feature of the HFO/diesel dominated power generation systems is the
   associated high electricity costs and heavy pollution. Despite an average consumer
   tariff of about US$8 cent/kWh, which is higher than the consumer prices in most MENA
   countries, revenues covered only about 25 percent of the economic cost of supply.
   Even in Sana’a, the service quality was poor with typically 2-3 outages per day for over 4
   hours. Most of the grid-connected consumers in other parts of the country suffered
   from more frequent daily load shedding of longer hours (The World Bank, 2013).

2. Conflict-related damages and challenges

3. The ongoing conflict has significantly worsened the electricity supply situation from an
   already low level, with severe impact on health, education, water and sanitation, and
   the private sector, which all rely heavily on a functioning power supply. As
   documented in the World Bank’s Damage and Needs Assessment (DNA Phase I) and the
   multi-agency DNA (World Bank, UN, EU and IsDB), the ongoing conflict has significantly
   impacted Yemen’s electricity infrastructure and cut off most of Yemen’s population
   from PEC’s services. Public electricity supply has been completely shut down in most
   populated areas and PEC has become virtually bankrupt. The current supply of public
   power capacity is averaging 200–250 MW, most of which is supplied to the port cities
   Aden and Al-Mukalla in the South (PEC, 2015). The capital Sana’a, which has a demand
   of around 500 MW, is barely supplied by 40 MW for a few hours a day (The World Bank,
   2016a). The rest of the country, including the port city Al Hodeida, is lacking access to
   any reliable public energy services. Using fuel sales to electricity plants as an indicator,
   total power generation in 2015, including from PEC and private generators, dropped by
   77 percent compared to 2014 (MOPIC, 2016).

4. The top-down model of service delivery has been replaced by a combination of locally
   managed urban public services and a private-sector driven bottom-up model. The
   almost complete collapse of public electricity supply and limited fuel availability for
   diesel generators has spawned a booming industry for small to medium-scale solar
   systems, especially since 2015. A recent market assessment commissioned by the
   World Bank estimates that over the last five years, around 1 billion USD has been
   invested into solar PV systems for the residential sector in Yemen. Based on interviews,
   the report estimates the market penetration of PV systems may have reached up to
   around 50% of households in rural areas and 75% in urban areas. The market is entirely
   driven by the private sector, with a supply chain that ranges from trading houses that
   import panels, control units and batteries from the GCC to small-scale electronics
   retailers that expanded their business to solar panels. In the capital Sana’a alone, over
   170 such retailers registered with the Government to enter the solar market over the
   period 2014 to 2016. While a supply shortage limited growth until the second quarter
   of 2015, prices have come down significantly since Q3 2015 as supply has caught up
   with demand (RCREEE, 2016).

5. The poor have limited access to solar so far, and there are concerns about the quality
   of the installed technology. The market assessment found that almost all systems are
   paid in cash and that debt finance is not readily available to most households. While
   several financial institutions offer loans for solar systems, these are often mainly
   targeted at government employees and costumers able to provide guarantees. This
   suggests that access to solar is so far limited for the lower quintiles of the population,


                                        Page |4
especially in rural areas. Furthermore, the market assessment many household solar
installations suffer from high failure rates due to improper system design, poor quality
components, and a lack of after-sales service. Households that gain access to electricity
through solar are thus at a risk of losing it again in case the system fails (RCREEE, 2017).

    3. Lessons learned & key principles for reengagement

    6. Because the limited functionality of the energy sector has severe consequences for
       other sectors and the overall Yemeni economy, restoring electricity supply will be a
       priority for any in-conflict or post-conflict engagement. Reestablishing access to
       electricity will be a highly visible contribution to restoring public service delivery and
       critical for restoring peace and revitalizing economic activity. Moreover, it is likely to
       contribute to a decrease in productivity, deterioration of the business environment, and
       reduction in the country’s gross domestic product . Assisting Yemen early on in the
       reconstruction of Yemen’s electricity system will lay the foundation for long -term
       engagement to improve governance and resilience in the energy sector, support to
       livelihoods’ stabilization and recovery, and expand access to sustainable energy.

    7. A recent review of the World Bank’s interventions1 over the last 15 years in the energy
       sector concluded that alternative models for procurement and/or project
       implementation may be needed for in-conflict or post-conflict interventions. The
       World Bank’s interventions over the last 10 years in the energy sector have been largely
       unsuccessful, in part due to what turned out to be a mismatch between the Bank’s
       strategy and the governance and institutional capacity in Yemen (The World Bank,
       2016b). Progress was sluggish despite significant lending made available and technical
       assistance to the PMUs in the form of engineering consultants hired to support
       decisions and the procurement process. The current conflict has led to further
       weakening of the sector institutions, fragmentation of institutional authority and
       deteriorated capacity. The development of the sector more broadly mirrors the Bank’s
       experience, with only one power plant constructed over the past 10 years (The World
       Bank, 2016c). There are four overarching lessons:

          a. Any new intervention needs to be grounded in a deeper understanding of the
             institutional capacity to implement and the political economy of the sector.
             Most recommendations of previous analytical assessments turned out to be out of
             sync with the Government’s implementation capacity and failed to take into
             account diverging interests between ministries (e.g., in the case of gas-to-power).

          b. Building bulky, large-scale electricity infrastructure in Yemen within the existing
             institutional framework is close to impossible. The World Bank’s strategy in
             Yemen’s electricity sector in the past decade had been to finance large-scale,
             public-sector owned infrastructure jointly with other donors, including from Gulf

  The Bank approved three IPFs with a total volume of US$90mn between 2006 and 2012. Disbursement for all
three projects was very slow as decision making in the sector institutions, especially in procurement, took much
longer than expected. None of the projects delivered much in terms of measurable outcomes.


                                                 Page |6
        States, the European Union and international finance institutions. However, even
        before the conflict, the main public institutions in the energy sector, specifically
        PEC and MEE, did not have adequate institutional capacity to implement large
        investments with multiple contracts in a timely manner even before the conflict.
        Progress was mainly hindered by: limited capacity of sector institutions to prepare
        financeable projects; inability to make timely procurement decisions; and poor
        execution and supervision of contracts. In all likelihood, the situation has
        worsened since the outbreak of conflict.

     c. New, project-specific public sector institutions created for the purpose of
        infrastructure development were no panacea. Examples of such new public
        sector institutions in the energy sector include institutional vehicles created for
        implementation of the Rural Energy Access Project (REAP) (The World Bank, 2009)
        and the Mocha Wind Project (The World Bank, 2014), which faced the same
        capacity and procedural constrains as PEC and MEE.

     d. Distributed infrastructure investments, while also not as successful as
        anticipated, tended to work better. The distribution grid component of the
        Power Sector Project, managed by the regional offices of PEC, was the only
        component of the project that showed some (limited) results (The World Bank,
        2016c). Community-led ownership and management of energy infrastructure,
        e.g., as attempted under the REAP, can improve responsiveness to local needs but
        there is no one-size-fits-all institutional model that works across all communities in
        Yemen. Under such an arrangement, the learning process that is needed to adapt
        models to local circumstances may slow down a rollout to a national level. No
        Bank investments directly supported the private sector.

8. This means that there may be a need to explore alternative models of procurement
   and financing energy infrastructure investments. Any alternative institutional options
   for project management should adhere to the following principles:

     a. Simplicity. In view of the limited government capacity – and institutions that
        make very little use of the capacity that does exist – complex institutional
        arrangements are unlikely to work. If a set of options is pursued in parallel, the
        portfolio of options has to be assessed in aggregate so as to not overburden the
        Government.

     b. Flexibility. Interventions should seek to map institutions to solutions, rather than
        pursuing a one-size-fits all approach. Rigidity should be avoided to ensure the
        institutional arrangement can be adapted to changing realities on the ground.




                                       Page |7
c. Service delivery. Interventions should focus on critical public services, including
   health services, water supply, street lighting, electricity and fuel supply and
   schools.

d. Pro-poor. Interventions should prioritize services that target poor urban
   households and rural communities.

e. Innovation. Interventions should make realistic and practical use of the Bank’s
   new procurement framework, specifically donor-led procurement and hands-on
   extended implementation support (HEIS).




                                 Page |8
4. Options for implementation arrangements

9. The main risks to any intervention relate to (a) the political and security situation,
   which if it changes significantly may reverse any gains made; (b) the fiduciary and
   technical capacity of the implementation partners, which may limit the pace at which
   intervention can be implemented; and (c) the political economy of the sector, as issues
   such as the non-payment of salaries may limit the pace at which any intervention can be
   implemented.

10. The institutional arrangements in particular would require careful consideration. The
    experience from the Bank’s recent engagement suggests that better delivery channels
    will be necessary to improve the performance of the energy sector in Yemen. Many
    recommendations of previous analytical assessments turned out to be out of sync with
    the GoY’s implementation capacity. The lending projects for alternative generation
    sources – mostly grant-financed – were closed largely undisbursed, despite the
    country’s low generation capacity and the fact that most existing plants run on hugely
    expensive imported diesel.

11. Alternative institutional options for project preparation, procurement decisions and
    execution/contract management for reconstruction of infrastructure projects include:

       a. Centrally coordinated project management by a cross-sectoral PMU, which like
          the Executive Bureau is integrating functions across line ministries, but whose
          mandate would include not only planning but also project identification,
          preparation, appraisal and procurement. Such a ‘reconstruction agency’ would
          be a transitionary structure with a limited mandate (e.g., three-years).

       b. Donor-led project management, where Government is involved in prioritization
          but donors prepare projects, procure on behalf of the Government and
          execute/manage contracts directly; hand-over could happen either directly after
          construction or after a certain time of asset operation (illustrations range from
          the recently approved emergency project of World Bank managed by UNDP or
          potential management of projects by donors from Gulf countries).

       c. Private sector led project management, where the Government or donors would
          specify general project requirements and institutionalize the fund allocation
          process but would leave delivery to the local private sector. This could work well
          in sectors that strived despite the conflict, such as solar energy, and where there
          is a strong business case post-conflict.

       d. Community-led project management, where the Government or donors would
          specify general project requirements and institutionalize the fund allocation


                                      Page |9
                  process but would leave project management to the local communities. The
                  most obvious channel for such an approach would be to expand funding to, and
                  broaden the scope of eligible infrastructure projects of the Social Fund for
                  Development.

             e. Sector-led project management with implementation support, where the
                traditional public sector institutions (ministries, SOEs) take responsibility but are
                supported by internationally funded project management staff that are
                seconded to the institutions.

    12. The advantages and limitations of the different options are summarized in Table 1
        below.

    13. The current status of Yemen’s energy sector suggests that a portfolio of options would
        be most suitable for re-engagement:

             a. Option C (private sector-led) would be most suitable for in-conflict interventions
                to scale up distributed energy services using solar energy, building on the
                existing, private-sector driven delivery channels. These could be supported
                through external funding provided to consumers through one or several financial
                intermediaries (private sector or NGOs). The financial intermediaries could be
                selected from the commercial banks and NGOs that already provide financing for
                solar systems, including the CAC Bank, the Yemen International Bank, the Yemen
                Commercial Bank, the National Microfinance Foundation, the Al-Kuraimi Islamic
                Microfinance, Amal Microfinance and the Small and Micro Enterprises
                Development Fund (SEDF) (or other relevant national or international NGOs).

             b. Option D (Community-led project management) would be suitable for in-conflict
                or post-conflict intervention to scale up distributed energy services if the
                program can build on proven, widely adopted institutional model, such as the
                SFD or the PWP.

             c. Option B (donor-led) could be an alternative for larger-scale infrastructure post
                conflict as the donor-led project management could compensate for the sector
                institutions’ lack of implementation capacity. Procurement of the equipment
                would be done on behalf of the client, either by the Bank or by one of the
                member institutions of the Arab Coordination Group (ACG). Upon delivery, the
                local implementation partners would install the equipment where needed. The
                local implementation partners would be the respective regional divisions of PEC,
                where these are still functional, or otherwise the municipal authorities.


                                                  P a g e | 11
       d. Option F (Sector-led project management with implementation support) would
          be suitable for larger-scale infrastructure post conflict, however only with
          extensive implementation support, as the post conflict capacity of PEC and
          ministry is likely to be further constrained compared to pre conflict.

14. Further considerations:

       a. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) could be arranged through a third party, such
          as a local or international NGO active in the targeted areas or a private
          contractor. This would be particularly relevant for in-conflict interventions.

       b. Post-conflict interventions would have to be consistent with (or done as part of)
          the government’s Post-Conflict Needs Assessment (PCNA).

       c. Procurement under any of the post-conflict options also has to be consistent
          with Yemen’s legal framework, which has, among others, relatively stringent
          requirements for procurement approval.

       d. Ultimately, the choice of institutional arrangement for post-conflict
          infrastructure investment has to be made by the Government. However, donors
          can facilitate decision by fleshing out technically sound options.

5. The way forward: Restoring electricity services in Yemen

15. The current status of information on the electricity sector and the sector institutions
    suggests that interventions to restore access to affordable electricity should be
    prioritized as follows:

       a. Immediate term (3 months and more): Expand access to privately-supplied,
          distributed energy services, especially solar; Restore electricity services to critical
          facilities in health, water and agriculture sectors, even if rudimentary

       b. Short term (1 year and more): Restore public electricity supply in selected urban
          grids; Strengthen capacity of public institutions on a municipal/regional level to
          provide electricity services

       c. Medium term (5 years and more): Restore functionality of national grid;
          Strengthen capacity of national electricity sector institutions, including the Public
          Electricity Company, to provide electricity services.

16. The proposed priorities represent sequential steps the electricity system is re-built
    from the bottom up, both technically and institutionally. Physically, the approach
    would prioritize in the immediate term technical solutions that already work on the
    ground (solar) and then move to increasingly ambitious solutions (from small off-grid
    systems, to urban/regional grids, to a national grid). This approach is based on the
    evidence about the current state of the infrastructure (mostly small off-grid systems and
    some public supply within sub-national grids), which will take time to rebuild.
    Institutionally, the priority would be to focus in the immediate term on the supply
    chains that have emerged as coping mechanisms during the conflict and only gradually
    move towards institutionally more difficult solutions: i.e., moving from (i) working with
    the current bottom-up, private-sector driven solution gradually towards (ii) involving
    municipal and regional public authorities and eventually (iii) working with the national
    public utility (PEC).

17. The proposed priorities and sequencing are underpinned by a vision for Yemen’s
    power sector that involves a stronger role for the private sector and more
    decentralized service provision. Service delivery in Yemen’s power sector has
    traditionally been public-sector driven and centrally coordinated (see Figure 1 for a
    stylized illustration). The conflict has turned this picture upside down, as the
    population’s coping mechanisms are decentralized and to a significant extent driven by
    the private sector. The proposed approach for reengagement would focus on
    strengthening the decentralized service delivery models that have emerged during the

conflict, with a view to gradually complementing decentralized service supply with
nation-wide        service      supply     from       PEC        (Figure      1c).

   18. Implementation of the immediate and medium-term priorities is proposed through
       two interventions supporting existing supply chains in the private sector (solar) and
       public sector (urban public grid supply). First, to expand access to solar energy for the
       rural and urban population by levering the private sector supply chain that has emerged
       during the conflict. Second, to provide funding and advice to what were the former
       regional offices of PEC (municipal level) to repair and reconstruct the heavily damaged
       urban electricity systems. A strong emphasis would be on restoring the quality of public
       services such as street lighting, water pumping, telecommunications, government
       services, health, education, etc.

Expanding access to solar power through the private-sector

   19. Given the difficulties in developing new generation assets or expanding energy access
       over last decade, there is an opportunity to take advantage of the emerging solar
       supply chain to provide decentralized power under a model driven by local citizens
       and private sector. Distributed solar has been one of the few thriving industries in
       Yemen during the past two years and is a rare success story for the private sector in the
       conflict. However, access has been uneven, with most systems being owned by better-
       off households in urban areas.

   20. The intervention would aim to expand access to electricity to low-income households
       and providers of critical public services. The first supported product range would be
       small-scale systems for low-income households. These systems suffice for lighting,
       phone charging and a few simple appliances. In other regions, the Bank has had good
       experiences with pre-selected and vetted suppliers and technical specifications. The
       proposed project would aim to replicate this experience in Yemen. The second
       supported product range would be slightly larger systems for providers of critical service
       providers. Only relatively few public service providers have so far adopted solar systems,
       with many relying on diesel despite the shortages of fuel. The proposed intervention
       would aim to use solar to expand electricity access for public services such as street
       lighting, water pumping, telecommunications, government services, health and
       education. Most of these would require slightly larger systems, either with larger
       batteries or designed as solar-diesel hybrids.

   21. The project would provide funding to the supply chain and consumers through one or
       several financial intermediaries. The financial intermediaries would be selected from
       the commercial banks and NGOs that already provide financing for solar systems,
       including the CAC Bank, the Yemen International Bank, the Yemen Commercial Bank, the
       National Microfinance Foundation, the Alkurami Islamic Micro Finance, Azal Micro
       Finance and the Small and Micro Enterprises Development Fund (SEDF) (or other
       relevant international NGOs). Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) would be arranged

       through a third party, such as a local or international NGO active in the targeted areas or
       a private contractor.

   22. Expanding and sustaining access to solar power could be part of a “new social
       compact? in the electricity sector and contribute to building more inclusive, bottom up
       service delivery driven by the private sector. Expanding distributed energy creates
       jobs, strengthen the private sector, provide a more resilient energy infrastructure and
       reduce the need for fuel import, refining and transport. It could also reduce costs:
       While electricity from distributed renewable energy sources would initially be costlier
       than national grid-electricity tariffs in Yemen, it is more affordable than electricity from
       the informal system of diesel generators, which is the only real alternative for most
       people in low-access regions.

Urban grid rehabilitation through the public sector

   23. Many of the major transmission linkages in the country are damaged, suggesting that
       grid-based electricity supply has to be restored on a regional level first before moving
       to the national level. Government reports indicate that all surveyed transmission lines
       in the country had suffered at least partial damage by October 2015. It is very likely that
       the situation has only deteriorated since then. Experience from the Power Sector
       Project suggests that restoring interregional transmission will require international
       contractors as local firms do not have enough capacity. These will be hesitant to return
       to Yemen even after peace is restored. The only feasible approach to restoring grid-
       based power supply may therefore be to start from municipal ‘island grids’ and then
       gradually expand the reach of supply through interconnections.

   24. The DNA also points to severe damage to the urban electricity systems, which
       suggests that all major cities require significant reconstruction and rehabilitation
       efforts to restore urban power supply. The DNA only contains information on the
       status of the distribution substations in Aden, Taiz, and Sana’a , but this information
       offers insights into the status of the distribution grid overall. In Aden, Taiz, and Sana’a,
       25 percent, 50 percent, and 37 percent, respectively, of the surveyed distribution
       substations are known to have suffered partial or complete damage as of October 2015.

   25. Municipal authorities will need material and equipment to rehabilitate the heavily
       damaged urban distribution networks. Providing these materials would allow grid-
       based electricity supply to be restored within specific parts of the country, as a
       precursor for a broader effort to restore supply across the transmission grid. The focus
       should be on standardized grid components and material that can be procured rapidly.
       Components to be supplied include but are not limited to (a) mobile, ‘plug and play’
       33/11 kV substations; (b) distributed generation sets, including solar-diesel hybrid
       systems; (c) overhead line hardware; (d) compact distribution transformers and low-


                                               17
   voltage substations; (e) switchgears, lighting arrestors, and fuses; and (f) aluminum and
   copper conductors. In general, these components are relatively easy to move around,
   as even the larger components such as substations are available in skid-mounted or
   containerized designs. However, substations would still require relatively good roads to
   be supplied to the target destination. Hence the focus in the short-term should be on
   ports to facilitate rapid delivery of the material to the implementing agencies. Yemen’s
   distribution grid is relatively standardized across the country, with most regions relying
   on 33/11 kV voltage levels.

26. A strong emphasis should be on restoring the electricity supply to critical public
    services such as street lighting, water pumping, telecommunications, government
    services, health and education. This would be achieved by prioritizing those districts
    and parts of the grid that offer the highest dividend in terms of restoring public services,
    e.g., circuits that connect hospitals or water infrastructure.

27. Strengthening service delivery on a municipal level would contribute to a more
    decentralized service delivery model and build capacity that is critical for the
    reconstruction phase. Yemen’s authorities have struggled for decades to expand
    energy access through the expansion of the national grid, and recurring conflicts have
    repeatedly set back whatever small progress was being made. A protracted conflict
    would mean that a centralized, nation-wide electricity grid is a distant prospect and
    electricity supply would for a foreseeable future be provided through a mix of private
    sector driven distributed energy, in particular solar and diesel, and smaller ‘island’ grids
    in urban population centers that are operated by what are now the regional units of PEC
    Strengthening the service delivery capacity of these units—both technically and
    institutionally—will be critical to restore electricity supply over the coming years.

Abstract: This paper builds on global experience and Kenya‚Äôs specific context to identify an effective
approach to scaling up nutrition and provide an estimate of costs and benefits of key nutrition interventions.
It is intended to help guide the selection of the most cost-effective interventions as well as strategies for
scaling up a package of interventions tailored to Kenya‚Äôs specific needs. The paper considers high-impact
‚Äúnutrition-specific‚Äù interventions that largely rely on typical health sector delivery mechanisms. We estimate
that the costs and benefits of implementing 11 critical nutrition-specific interventions would require a yearly
public and donor investment of $76 million. The expected benefits would be substantial: annually more than
455,000 DALYs would be averted, over 5,000 lives saved, and more than almost 700,000 cases of stunting
among children under five averted. This investment would be very cost-effective with an estimated cost per
DALY averted of $207 cost per life saved of about $18,600 and a cost per case of stunting averted of $135
Economic productivity could potentially increase by $458 million over the productive lives of beneficiaries.
However, we also calculate intermediate scale-up scenarios since it may not be feasible for the Government
of Kenya or its partners to achieve full coverage in the near term. We compare the costs and benefits
associated with three different scenarios: first, prioritizing counties, focusing the investment on counties
with a high burden of stunting; second, prioritizing interventions, focusing on only a subset of the most
effective interventions; and third, prioritizing both counties and interventions, delivering only the most
effective subset of interventions to high-burden counties. We determined that the third scenario is the most
cost-effective and least costly. Scaling up the most cost-effective interventions in 37 high-burden counties
would avert almost 295,000 DALYs and save over 3,000 lives per year for an annual public and donor
investment of $48 million.

Keywords: nutrition-specific interventions, cost-effectiveness of nutrition interventions, Kenya, cost-
benefit analysis, nutrition financing.

A benefit-cost ratio summarizes the overall value of a project or proposal. It is the ratio of the benefits of
a project or proposal, expressed in monetary terms, relative to its costs, also expressed in monetary terms.
The benefit-cost ratio takes into account the amount of monetary gain realized by implementing a project
versus the amount it costs to execute the project. The higher the ratio, the better the investment. A general
rule is that if the benefit from a project is greater than its cost, the project is a good investment.

Capacity development for program delivery is a process that involves increasing in-country human
capacity and systems to design, deliver, manage, and evaluate large-scale interventions (World Bank
2010). This includes developing skills by training public health personnel and community volunteers to
improve the delivery of services. These efforts typically accompany program implementation or, when
possible, precede program implementation. In this analysis we allocate 9 percent of total programmatic
costs to capacity development for program delivery.

Cost-benefit analysis is an approach to economic analysis that weighs the cost of an intervention against
its benefits. The approach involves assigning a monetary value to the benefits of an intervention and
estimating the expected present value of the net benefits, known as the net present value. Net benefits are
the difference between the cost and monetary value of benefits of the intervention. The net present value
is defined mathematically as:
                                                                               Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á
                                                                                          Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°
         Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±Å Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ù Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£ = ÔøΩ                           ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂0
                                                                                       (1 + Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü)Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°
                                                                            Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°=1


where Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° is net cash inflows, Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂0 is the initial investment, the index Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° is the time period, and Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü is the discount
rate. A positive net present value, when discounted at appropriate rates, indicates that the present value of
cash inflows (benefits) exceeds the present value of cash outflows (cost of financing). Interventions with
net present values that are at least as high as alternative interventions provide greater benefits than
interventions with net present values equal to or lower than alternatives. The results of cost-benefit analysis
can also be expressed in terms of the benefit-cost ratio.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is an approach to economic analysis that is intended to identify interventions
that produce the desired results at the lowest cost. Cost-effectiveness analysis requires two components:
the total cost of the intervention and an estimate of the intervention‚Äôs impact, such as the number of lives
saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio can be defined as:

                                                                                                                               Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ú Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ

The analysis involves comparing the cost-effectiveness ratios among alternative interventions with the
same outcomes. The intervention with the lowest cost per benefit is considered to be the most cost-effective
intervention among the alternatives.

A DALY is a disability-adjusted life year, which is equivalent to a year of healthy life lost due to a health
condition. The DALY, developed in 1993 by the World Bank, combines the years of life lost from a disease
(YLL) and the years of life spent with disability from the disease (YLD). DALYs count the gains from both
mortality (how many more years of life lost due to premature death are prevented) and morbidity (how many
years or parts of years of life lost due to disability are prevented). An advantage of the DALY is that it is a
metric that is recognized and understood by external audiences such as the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It helps to gauge the contribution of individual diseases
relative to the overall burden of disease by geographic region or health area. Combined with cost data,
DALYs allow for estimating and comparing the cost-effectiveness of scaling up nutrition interventions in
different countries.

A discount rate refers to a rate of interest used to determine the current value of future cash flows. The
concept of the time value of money suggests that income earned in the present is worth more than the
same amount of income earned in the future because of its earning potential. A higher discount rate reflects
higher losses to potential benefits from alternative investments in capital. A higher discount rate may also
reflect a greater risk premium of the intervention.

The internal rate of return is the discount rate that produces a net present value of cash flows equal to
zero. An intervention has a non-negative net present value when the internal rate of return equals or
exceeds the appropriate discount rate. Interventions yielding higher internal rates of return than alternatives
tend to be considered more desirable than the alternatives.

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is an estimation tool that translates measured coverage changes into
estimates of mortality reduction and cases of childhood stunting averted. LiST is used to project how
increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal survival. It is part of an integrated set of
tools that comprise the Spectrum policy modeling system.

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E), operations research, and technical support for program delivery
are all elements of cost-effective and efficient program implementation. Monitoring involves checking
progress against plans through the systematic and routine collection of information from projects and
programs in order to learn from experience to improve practices and activities in the future, to ensure
internal and external accountability of the resources used and the results obtained, and to make informed
decisions on the future of the intervention. Monitoring is a periodically recurring task. Evaluation is the
assessing, as systematically and objectively as possible, of a completed project or intervention (or a phase
of an ongoing project). Operations research aims to inform the program designers about ways to deliver
interventions more effectively and efficiently. Technical support entails ensuring that training, support, and
maintenance for the physical elements of the intervention are available. In this costing exercise we allocate
2 percent of total intervention costs for M&E, operations research, and technical support.

Nutrition-sensitive interventions are those that have an indirect impact on nutrition and are delivered
through sectors other than health such as the agriculture, education, and water, sanitation, and hygiene
sectors. Examples include biofortification of food crops, conditional cash transfers, and water and sanitation
infrastructure improvements.

Nutrition-specific interventions are those that address the immediate determinants of child nutrition, such
as adequate food and nutrition intake, feeding and caregiving practices, and treating disease. Examples
include promotion of good infant and young child nutrition, micronutrient supplementation, and deworming.

Sensitivity analysis is a technique that evaluates the robustness of findings when key variables change.
It helps to identify the variables with the greatest and least influence on the outcomes of the intervention,
and it may involve adjusting the values of a variable to observe the impact of the variable on the outcome.

Stunting is an anthropometric measure of low height-for-age. It is an indicator of chronic undernutrition and
is the result of prolonged food deprivation and/or disease or illness. It is measured in terms of Z-score (or

of ‚àí2 or lower.

Underweight is an anthropometric measure of low weight-for-age. It is used as a composite indicator to
reflect both acute and chronic undernutrition, although it cannot distinguish between them. It is measured
in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below); a child is considered underweight
with a weight-for-age Z-score of ‚àí2 or lower.

Wasting is an anthropometric indicator of low weight-for-height. It is an indicator of acute undernutrition
and the result of more recent food deprivation or illness. It is measured in terms of Z-score (or standard
deviation score; see definition below). A child with a weight-for-height Z-score of ‚àí2 or lower is considered
wasted.

                                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The overall objective of this paper is to provide technical assistance to the Government of Kenya for the
implementation of its nutrition policy and programs. It provides the Government of Kenya with the tools
needed to leverage adequate domestic resources as well as from development partners in support of
implementing the nutrition scale-up plan. The executive summary, written for policy makers, highlights the
main findings and discusses the implications for nutrition policy in Kenya. The remainder of the report is
more technical in nature and is written for a broader audience, including planners and programmers. The
analysis is expected to bring evidence of the potential for impact and allocative efficiency for Kenya‚Äôs
nutrition programming.

The prevalence of chronic undernutrition, as measured by stunting in children under five, was 26 percent
in 2014 and, although a decline from 35 percent in 2008‚Äì09, it nevertheless represents a heavy burden of
undernutrition in Kenya. Micronutrient deficiencies (hidden hunger) are also prevalent, with high rates of
vitamin A deficiency and anemia. There is wide geographical disparity in stunting rates in the country; the
highest rates are in West Pokot and Kitui, which had stunting rates above 45 percent in 2014.

Malnutrition, particularly in very young children, leads to increased mortality, increased illness, and longer-
term adverse effects on cognitive abilities and schooling outcomes, thereby producing irreversible losses
to human capital that contribute to missed opportunities in economic productivity later in life. Undernutrition
is responsible for about one-half of under-five child mortality and one-fifth of maternal mortality in developing
countries (Black et al. 2013). In the longer term, stunting results in a 10 to 17 percent loss in wages.
Furthermore, Kenya loses over $2.8 billion in GDP annually to vitamin and mineral deficiencies alone (World
Bank 2011).

At the same time, nutrition interventions are consistently identified as being among the most cost-effective
development actions, and the costs of scaling up nutrition interventions are modest. Cost-benefit analysis
shows that nutrition interventions are highly effective (Hoddinott et al. 2013; World Bank 2010, 2012). It is
estimated that investing in nutrition can increase a country‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) by at least 3
percent annually (Horton and Steckel 2013).

This report identifies costs and benefits of key nutrition programs in Kenya and is intended to help guide
the prioritization of the most cost-effective interventions. The report uses the costing framework established
by Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost? (World Bank 2010) and applies it to the Kenyan context.
Combining costing with estimates of impact (in terms of lives saved, DALYs averted, and cases of stunting
averted) and cost-effectiveness analysis, the results will aid in priority-setting by identifying the most cost-
effective packages of interventions in situations where financial and human resources are constrained.

We first estimate costs and benefits of implementing 11 high-impact nutrition-specific interventions in
Kenya. We refer to this as the full coverage scenario, or Scenario 0, and estimate that it would require an
annual public and donor investment of $76 million. The expected benefits are huge: over 455,000 DALYs
averted and 5,000 lives saved annually (Summary Table), while some 700,000 cases of stunting among
children under five would be averted.

Note: a. Cost per DALY averted is calculated by dividing all costs, before subtracting household contributions, by the
number of DALYs averted (see Table 10 in the main text.).
b. Excludes the public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition.

Given resource constraints, few countries are able to effectively scale up all 11 nutrition-specific
interventions to full national coverage immediately (Scenario 0). We therefore consider three less costly
scale-up scenarios for Kenya based on considerations of burden of stunting, potential for impact, costs,
and capacity for implementation:

    ‚Ä¢    Scenario 1: Scale up by county group
    ‚Ä¢    Scenario 2: Scale up by intervention
    ‚Ä¢    Scenario 3: Scale up by county group and intervention

Scenarios 2 and 3 are the most advantageous when considered in terms of cost-effectiveness and resource
requirements (see the Summary Table). The most cost-effective scenario, Scenario 3, with a cost per DALY
averted of $179, would scale up 10 cost-effective interventions in 37 counties with stunting rates above 20
percent and would require $48 million in public resources annually. One intervention ‚Äì the public provision
of complementary foods for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition ‚Äì is excluded from this scenario
because it is not nearly as cost-effective as the others. The second most cost-effective scenario, Scenario
2, would scale up the same interventions nationwide and require an annual public and donor investment of
$61 million. Although not quite as cost-effective (with a cost per DALY averted of $181), this scenario would
reach more beneficiaries and therefore reduce more malnutrition. The choice between the two scenarios
will likely depend on the level of resources that can be leveraged for nutrition.

These costs assume scale-up to full coverage in one year. However, recognizing that a slower, incremental
scale-up may be more feasible, we also estimate the cost for scaling up selected scenarios over a five-year
scale-up time frame: to achieve the full coverage scenario would require an estimated $213 million over
five years, scaling up 10 interventions nationwide would require $171 million over five years, and scaling
up 10 interventions only in high burden counties would $135 million over five years.

These investments in nutrition could also yield tremendous economic benefits for Kenya. The full scale-up
annual investment of $76 million also has the potential to increase economic productivity over the
productive lives of the beneficiaries by $458 million and yield an impressive rate of return on the investment
of 22 percent. The investment would also yield large net present values of between $2.1 and $7.2 billion,
depending on the discount rate assumed. The benefit-cost ratio of the investment is 22, which means that

every dollar invested in nutrition interventions has the potential to result in up to 22 dollars in economic
returns. 1

These findings provide the government with several cost-effective scenarios for addressing malnutrition in
Kenya; the most cost-effective would provide 10 nutrition-specific interventions in 37 counties with high
burden of stunting. The next step will be for the Government of Kenya to incorporate these findings into its
nutrition strategy and mobilize resources for its implementation.

Even though this report focuses exclusively on nutrition-specific interventions, the causes of malnutrition
are multisectoral, so the longer-term approach to improving nutrition outcomes must also include nutrition-
sensitive interventions. Thus an important next step will be to identify the most cost-effective nutrition-
sensitive interventions.

                                         PART I ‚Äì BACKGROUND
                                                 COUNTRY CONTEXT

Kenya serves as a major industrial and trade hub in East Africa because of its prime location as an entrance
to the continent from the east and its borders with five other countries (Figure 1). With almost 225,000
square miles of terrain, Kenya is home to more than 46 million people, of whom a large proportion is under
15 years of age (KNBS 2010). Despite being one of the fastest-growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa
in recent years (World Bank 2015), an estimated 46 percent of Kenya‚Äôs population live below the poverty
line (World Bank 2016). 2 The country relies heavily on agriculture, tourism, and raw materials export as
sources of income. In 2014, Kenya ranked 147 out of the 187 countries and territories in the Human
Development Index (UNDP 2015a). Kenya is transitioning from a low- to low-middle-income country, with
a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $1,358 in 2014 (World Bank 2014). The Gini coefficient, a
measure of income inequality, however, remains high at 48 (UNDP 2015a).

Almost 70 percent of Kenya‚Äôs terrain is composed of arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL), partly as a
consequence of being situated on the equator and partly because of less than adequate rainfall in the
interior counties. As will be discussed in more detail in the next section, stark geographic differences in
climate and vegetation have contributed to disparities in poverty and health outcomes, with much of the
burden of disease falling on populations in ASAL. Following the June 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa
and subsequent rises in food and fuel prices, Kenya faced significant challenges in ensuring access to food
for the most affected populations.

There is some association between stunting and poverty in Kenya. At the geographic level, most (but not
all) of the counties with very high stunting rates also have the highest poverty rates but not all the counties
with highest poverty rates also have the highest stunting rates, indicating a less than perfect association
(Figure 4). When stratified by household wealth, the prevalence of stunting in the poorest quintile is two
and a half times higher than it is for the richest quintile in Kenya (Figure 5). About 36 percent of children
under five years of age in the lowest wealth quintile are stunted. Although stunting rates in the two wealthiest
quintiles are lower than that for the poorest quintile, they remain unacceptably high, at 14 percent and 21
percent, demonstrating that poverty alone does not cause malnutrition. Other factors, such as the burden
of disease, access to adequate sanitation, food diversity and optimal feeding and caregiving practices, also
affect levels of stunting (Smith and Haddad 2015).

Acute malnutrition, as measured by wasting, affects 4 percent of Kenyan children, and almost 1 percent
are severely wasted. 4 Wasting levels are highest in age groups 6‚Äì8 months and 9‚Äì11 months, at 7 percent,
consistent with the age at which complementary foods can be introduced. Although wasting is present
across all income levels, it is most pronounced within the lowest wealth quintile group (7.3 percent) and
among children of mothers with no schooling (10.2 percent). Geographically, wasting tends to be
concentrated in the northern counties, where levels range from 11 percent to 23 percent. (See Figure 8
below.)

Eleven percent of Kenyan children are underweight, with 2 percent classified as severely underweight.
Underweight, measured by children whose weight for age is below minus two standard deviations (‚àí2SD)
of the reference population, reflects the effects of both acute and chronic malnutrition. Peak levels of
underweight are found among children aged 24‚Äì35 months. A higher percentage of children in rural areas
than urban ones are underweight, at 13 percent compared to 7 percent; and boys are slightly more affected
than girls (12 percent compared to 10 percent, respectively). More than 25 percent of children in three
counties (Samburu, Turkana and West Pokot) of the Rift Valley region, and one county (Marsabit) in the
Eastern region are underweight.

Micronutrient deficiencies in pregnant women and young children persist, although some information on
the extent of these deficiencies is outdated. 5 A 2010 Kenya malaria indicator survey (KMIS) reported
approximately 41 percent of children 6-59 months were moderately anemic and 5 percent were severely
anemic (Kenya 2011c), which is a drop from 69 percent reported in 1999. At the same time, micronutrient

    In this analysis we assume that wasting includes edema/kwashiorkor, which is predominantly seen in urban slums and along the
          coast and rare in the ASAL.

    Based on a 1999 survey, vitamin A deficiency was 84.4 percent among preschool children and 17.3 percent in pregnant women
        (WHO 2009). In the same survey (1999), anemia prevalence was 69 percent and 55.1 percent among preschool children and
        pregnant women respectively (WHO 2008). However, a national micronutrient study was conducted in 2011 and is due to be
        released in 2016.

supplementation program coverage expanded between 2008-9 and 2014. Regarding iron supplementation
(Figure 6), in 2014 only 8 percent of women took iron tablets for 90 or more days during their last pregnancy;
this share was up from 3 percent in 2008‚Äì09. In addition, the share of women who received no iron
supplementation was 30 percent in 2014 and has remained constant since 2008‚Äì09. Since low iron intake
has adverse effects for both mother and child, including the risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight,
providing routine iron folate supplementation may decrease this burden (Allen 2000) as is recommended
in the national nutrition action plan (NNAP). There was also a large increase in the proportion of children
receiving vitamin A supplements: from 30 percent in 2008‚Äì09 to 72 percent in 2014 (KDHS 2014). The
proportion increases with the mother‚Äôs increasing education and greater household wealth. Fifty-four
percent of postpartum women received vitamin A supplementation in 2014, as compared to 46 percent in
2008‚Äì09 (Figure 7).

Although progress is reducing malnutrition been made, Kenya now faces a double burden of malnutrition:
continued high rates of undernutrition coupled with increasing rates of obesity. In 2015, 27 percent of
Kenyans were either overweight or obese with the percentage being significantly higher in women (37.5
percent) than men (17.5 percent) (KNBS 2016). The same survey also highlighted the increasing rates of
non-communicable diseases in Kenya. The 2014 KHDS reported approximately 7.2 percent of preschool
children were overweight or obese.

Kenya has seen gains in recent years in both immediate and underlying factors affecting nutritional status,
although more progress is needed. For example, breastfeeding and the appropriate introduction of
complementary foods are important determinants of the nutritional status of children, particularly among
children under the age of two years. The proportion of children younger than 6 months who are breastfed
exclusively has increased dramatically‚Äîfrom 32 percent reported in the KDHS 2008‚Äì09 to 61 percent in
2014. However, the transition to solid foods beyond 6 months is less positive. In Kenya, only about two in
ten (22 percent) children aged 6 to 23 months consume a ‚Äúminimum acceptable diet,‚Äù which means
consumption breastmilk or milk products, adequate diet diversity and appropriate meal frequency for the
child‚Äôs age (KDHS 2014).

Citizens living in ASAL counties generally have poorer nutritional status (Figure 8). Differences in wasting
between arid and non-arid counties are the most striking: arid counties have an average wasting prevalence
of 10.0 percent, compared to 3.4 percent and 2.3 percent for semi-arid and non-ASAL counties,
respectively. To a lesser extent, underweight prevalence also varies by type of terrain averaging 17 percent
in ASAL, 10 percent in semi-arid, and 7 percent in non-ASAL counties (KDHS 2014).

                     NATIONAL AND PARTNER EFFORTS TO ADDRESS MALNUTRITION IN KENYA

Kenya joined the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement in August 2012 and quickly codified its approach
to nutrition in the NNAP (Kenya, Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation 2012). The plan adopted 11 high-
impact interventions drawn from the 2008 and 2013 Lancet series and other relevant analyses, including
from the World Bank. The NNAP provides the main governing framework for nutrition in Kenya, and it is
supplemented by:

    1. The National Food and Nutrition Security Policy (FNSP) 2011, which has three objectives: to
       achieve adequate nutrition for the optimum health of all Kenyans; to increase the quantity and
       quality of food available, accessible, and affordable to all Kenyans at all times; and to protect
       vulnerable populations using innovative and cost-effective safety nets linked to long-term
       development (Kenya 2011a).
    2. Legislative actions, including a set of laws passed in 2012 on the mandatory fortification of cereal
       flours and vegetable oils and on breastmilk substitution regulation and control.
    3. The Common Programme Framework for Ending Drought Emergencies (EDE), which seeks to
       reduce vulnerability to droughts and emergencies in the 23 arid and semi-arid counties in the ASAL.
       The EDE identifies nutrition as key to building resilience and reducing vulnerability to future
       droughts (Kenya 2012).
    4. The Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS), which aims to achieve a 7 percent growth
       rate in the agricultural sector between 2013 and 2017. The related ASDS Medium-Term Investment
       Plan contains a number of references to food and nutrition security and earmarks roughly 4 percent
       of the total budget to the FNSP (Kenya 2010b).

The country‚Äôs devolution of administrative and governance structures and of political power from the
national and provincial levels to the 47 counties has reduced the national government‚Äôs ability to advance
the aims of its FNSP. It has also made it more difficult to enforce the legislative actions taken in 2012.




                                                                                                                                                                             9
Oversight of the NNAP lies with the Nutrition Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee, which is chaired by the
Ministry of Health. This arrangement has made it possible to ensure good interagency coordination for
nutrition-specific interventions, but not for nutrition-sensitive ones. The Ministry of Health requested more
ministries to nominate a nutrition focal point to address this deficiency, and to support the Government
Scaling up Nutrition Network which intends to be cross ministerial but so far this has not resulted in
significantly more engagement on the part of the other line ministries.

External assistance for nutrition comes from a wide range of bilateral and multilateral donors, including the
Department for International Development (DFID), the European Union (EU), the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), and others. The types of programs are wide ranging and encompass
both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions. In the past, external support for nutrition-specific
interventions was focused on emergencies or humanitarian assistance, including assistance for refugees,
and was targeted to ASAL areas. The $30 million IDA grant from the World Bank for the Horn of Africa
Emergency Health and Nutrition Project supported treatment and prevention of acute malnutrition among
children and promotion of good nutrition for pregnant and lactating women, with a geographic focus on
ASAL counties. A 2013 IDA credit of $41 million for the Health Sector Support Project supports expanded
essential nutrition services such as antenatal checkups during pregnancy to 20 ASAL counties, where
access to quality health services is generally weak

Recent support from the EU, UKAID and USAID include a more development-focused, multi-year approach,
with a system strengthening focus. This shift in approach is based on the learning from 2008 when, with
UNICEF‚Äôs support, a move was made to integrate the package of nutrition interventions into the Maternal
and Child Health Program from parallel NGO led programs. More recently this has evolved to include a risk
informed angle which allows the health systems to scale up and down as needed during times of crisis
when caseloads of acutely malnourished children increase. Other recent successful integration efforts by
the MoH supported by UNICEF have included essential nutrition commodities into the MoH led supply chain
and nutrition information into the national early warning systems.

Nutrition-sensitive interventions reflect a range of programs that address the underlying determinants of
malnutrition especially within vulnerable populations, often adopting an integrated approach. These may
include programs as diverse as agriculture and food security, social protection, early childhood
development, women‚Äôs empowerment, health and family planning, and so on. Donors have continued to
prioritize the ASAL areas for nutrition-sensitive as well as nutrition-specific programs by a wide margin.

The EU Delegation and the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) are working to improve nutrition by
investing in the agricultural sector. In addition to funding maternal and child health nutrition programs, the
EU‚Äôs agriculture and rural development projects funded under the Strengthening Horn of Africa Resilience
to Emergencies (SHARE) have promoted food security and livelihoods in both ASAL and non-ASAL areas.
GIZ is supporting food security programs in northern and western Kenya during the period 2014‚Äì16. The
food security and drought resilience program is not only focused on implementing sectoral reforms in two
counties (Marsabit and Turkana), but is also investing in technology transfer and training. In other counties,
GIZ seeks to promote food security by improving agricultural productivity with a focus on irrigation and
intensifying small-scale production systems.

Part of the U.S. Government‚Äôs Feed the Future Initiative, ‚ÄúResilience and Economic Growth in Arid Lands
‚Äì Improving Resilience,‚Äù is reducing hunger and poverty, increasing resilience and social stability, and
building a foundation for economic growth among pastoral communities in Kenya‚Äôs ASALs. It unites
humanitarian and development assistance to build resilience and expand economic opportunities in the arid
lands through disaster risk and conflict reduction, natural resource management, and strengthening of
livestock and other sectors.

          PART II ‚Äì COSTED SCALE-UP SCENARIOS: RATIONALE,
             OBJECTIVES, METHODOLOGY, AND RESULTS
The overall objective of this cost-effectiveness analysis is to support the Government of Kenya in
developing a costed scale-up plan for nutrition. It will provide the government with the tools it needs to
leverage adequate resources from its domestic resources, as well as from development partners, in support
of the costed scale-up plan. Within this context, the objectives of this analysis are as follows:

    ‚Ä¢   To estimate scale-up costs in Kenya for a set of well-proven nutrition-specific interventions that
        have the potential to be scaled up through tested delivery mechanisms
    ‚Ä¢   To conduct a basic economic analysis to calculate the potential benefits and cost-effectiveness
        associated with the proposed scale-up
    ‚Ä¢   To propose a series of scenarios for a costed scale-up plan that rolls out this package of nutrition-
        specific interventions in phases, based on considerations of impact, geography, implementation
        capacity, and cost.

Although the economic arguments for increasing investments in nutrition are sound, one of the first
questions raised by key decision makers in any country is ‚ÄúHow much will it cost?‚Äù In 2010 the World Bank
spearheaded a study called Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost? to answer that question at the global
level. The analysis estimated the level of global financing required to scale up evidence-based nutrition-
specific interventions in 36 countries that account for 90 percent of the world‚Äôs stunting burden and 32
smaller countries that also have a high prevalence of undernutrition. The results of the study highlighted
the global financing gap, underscored the importance of investing in nutrition at the global level, and laid
out a methodology for estimating the costs of nutrition-specific interventions. However, these global
estimates neither captured the nuances and context in each country, nor contextualized the estimates to
every individual country‚Äôs policy and capacity setting or its fiscal constraints. This report builds on the early
work to address this gap and contextualize the cost estimates for Kenya.

The multisectoral approach requires nutrition-sensitive approaches or interventions that can be delivered
through other sectors. However, a full assessment of nutrition-sensitive approach is beyond the scope of
this report.


                SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTIONS
The analysis presents estimated costs and benefits for the set of 11 nutrition-specific interventions that
have strong evidence of impact and were included in the World Bank‚Äôs Scaling Up Nutrition report (2010)
and are delivered primarily through the health sector. They are a modified package of the interventions
included in the 2008 and 2013 Lancet series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition, tailored to the Kenyan
context. These 11 interventions are based on current scientific evidence and there is general consensus
from the global community about their impact. Some interventions‚Äîsuch as deworming and iron-
fortification of staple foods‚Äîthat were included in the 2008 Lancet series but not listed in the 2013 Lancet
series are included here because they remain relevant to Kenya. Others‚Äîsuch as calcium supplementation
for women and prophylactic zinc supplementation‚Äîare excluded because delivery mechanisms are not
available in client countries, including Kenya, and/or there are no clear World Health Organization (WHO)
protocols or guidelines for large-scale programming. The interventions are also in line with the key
interventions identified in (1) Kenya‚Äôs National Food and Nutrition Security Policy; (2) the multisectoral
stakeholders‚Äô consultation workshop that took place in November 2014; and (3) the ‚Äúminimum package‚Äù or
priority interventions to be scaled up with the support of the SUN Fund. Generally speaking, there is a lack
of standard protocol for the management and/or treatment of moderate acute malnutrition. In this report we
use the phrase management of moderate acute malnutrition because it most accurately reflects the
protocols used in Kenya. The interventions and the associated target population are specified in Table 1.

ESTIMATION OF TARGET POPULATION SIZES, CURRENT COVERAGE LEVELS, AND UNIT COSTS

Target population estimates are based primarily on demographic data obtained from the 2009 Kenyan
Population and Housing Census. The prevalence of child stunting (height-for-age Z-score < ‚àí2),
underweight (weight-for-age Z-score < ‚àí2), and severe wasting (weight-for-height Z-score < ‚àí3) among
children under five years of age in each province were obtained from the KDHS 2014. (See Appendix 1 for
population totals and stunting and wasting rates by county.)




                                                             12
Current coverage levels for promotion of good infant and young child nutrition and hygiene practices,
multiple micronutrient powders for children to fortify homemade complementary food, and public provision
of complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition were set to 0 percent because
interventions were not being implemented, coverage was very minimal, or reliable data were not available.
Coverage data for vitamin A supplementation, zinc supplementation with ORS, deworming, iron-folic acid
supplements for pregnant women, and households consuming adequately iodized salt were obtained from
the KDHS 2014. Coverage data on fortified foods in Kenya was obtained from the Global Alliance for
Improved Nutrition (GAIN 2015). Finally, coverage of treatment of severe acute malnutrition was obtained
from the Kenya National CMAM Coverage Workshop Report and National Action Plan, 2014 (Coverage
Monitoring Network, UNICEF, and Global Nutrition Cluster 2014). The estimates of the current incidence of
severe acute malnutrition and moderate acute malnutrition, were also obtained from the 2014 KDHS.

Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except for treatment of
moderate and severe acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to be 80 percent. This definition
is consistent with the methodology used in World Bank‚Äôs Scaling Up Nutrition report (2010), and is based
on the reality that few community-based treatment programs have successfully achieved more than 80
percent coverage at scale. Table 2 shows current and additional coverage needed for each intervention.

Whenever possible, the unit costs of the nutrition-specific interventions were estimated using programmatic
data provided in a reference report prepared by UNICEF Costing of Kenya High Impact Nutrition
Interventions (2015). Unit costs included direct supply and input costs, as well as transportation costs and
time costs of medical personnel involved in the delivery of the nutrition interventions. The estimated unit
costs and the delivery platforms are listed in Table 3. A complete index of data sources and relevant
assumptions for these interventions is provided in Appendix 2.

The program experience methodology employed in the Scaling Up Nutrition report (World Bank 2010) is
used for calculating the cost of scaling up in Kenya. This approach generates unit cost data that capture all
aspects of service delivery‚Äîincluding the costs of commodities, transportation and storage, personnel,
training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), relevant overhead, wastage, and so on for each
intervention‚Äîfrom actual programs that are already in operation in Kenya, and considers the context in
which they are delivered. Another commonly used method is the ingredients approach, in which selected
activities are bundled into appropriate delivery packages (such as the number of visits to a health center;
see Bhutta et al. 2013, for example). Although the program experience approach tends to yield cost
estimates that are higher than the ingredients approach, the estimates more accurately reflect real
programmatic experience, including inefficiencies in service delivery. It should be noted, however, that the
calculated costs are reported in financial or budgetary terms. They do not capture the full social resource
requirements, which account for the opportunity costs of the time committed by beneficiaries accessing the
services.

We calculate the annual public and donor investment required to scale up the interventions as follows:

           Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å = (Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 + Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 ) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3

where:

           Y = annual public and donor investment required to scale up to full coverage 6
           Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 = additional total direct cost to scale up to full coverage
           Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
           Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3 = cost covered by households living above the poverty line for selected interventions

6   Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except for community-based
        treatment of severe and moderate acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to be 80 percent.



                                                              14
Following the method used in the global report Scaling Up Nutrition (World Bank 2010), the costs for
overhead (represented by Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 ) are assumed to be 9 percent of the total cost for capacity development
(including, for example, information management, program coordination, and advocacy) and 2 percent of
the total cost for M&E and technical assistance. The analysis assumes that households above the poverty
line could cover their own cost of iron fortification, multiple micronutrient powders, salt iodization, and
complementary food from private resources and so these costs are deducted from the total (represented
by Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3 ). The increased program coverage is calculated by subtracting the current coverage rate from full
coverage and multiplying this difference by the size of the target population for each intervention. Appendix
3 describes the methodology in detail.

The expected benefits from scaling up nutrition interventions are calculated in terms of (1) DALYs averted,
(2) number of lives saved, (3) cases of childhood stunting averted, and (4) increased program coverage.
To calculate the number of DALYs averted, we use the method employed by Black et al. (2008) to estimate
the averted morbidity and mortality from scaling up different nutrition interventions. The method uses
population attributable fractions (PAF) based on the comparative risk assessment project (Ezzati et al.
2002; Ezzati et al. 2004) to estimate the burden of infectious diseases attributable to different forms of
undernutrition using most recent Global Burden of Disease Study (IHME 2010). DALY estimates in this
study are neither discounted nor age-weighted, in line with the methodology used in the Global Burden of
Disease Study and the WHO Global Health Estimates (2012). Appendix 4 describes the methodology for
estimating DALYs. The projected number of lives saved and cases of childhood stunting averted are
calculated using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), which translates measured coverage changes into estimates
of mortality reduction and changes in the prevalence of under-five stunting. Because of methodological
limitations of LiST, the number of DALYs averted is based on seven interventions, 7 the number of lives
saved is based on six interventions, 8 and cases of childhood stunting averted is based on three
interventions. 9 As such, our estimates are likely to underestimate the number of DALYs averted, lives saved
and cases of childhood stunting averted.

The measures for the cost-effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions are calculated in terms of cost
per DALY averted, cost per life saved, and cost per case of stunting averted. Estimates of benefits were
combined with information on total costs (direct costs plus capacity development, M&E and technical
assistance) to produce the cost-effectiveness measures for each intervention as well as for the overall
package of interventions. The evaluation of the cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of DALYs averted is based
on the categorization used by WHO-CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective): 10 an
intervention is considered to be ‚Äúvery cost-effective‚Äù if the range for the cost per DALY averted is less than
GDP per capita; 11 it is considered to be ‚Äúcost-effective‚Äù if it is between one and three times GDP per capita;
and it is considered ‚Äúnot cost-effective‚Äù if it exceeds three times GDP per capita (WHO 2014a).

The cost-benefit analysis is based on the estimated economic value of the benefits attributable to nutrition-
specific interventions. In order to arrive at a dollar value for the impact on mortality and morbidity of a five-
year scale-up plan, we use estimates of the number of lives saved and the reduction in stunting prevalence
produced by the LiST. Following established practice, a life year saved is valued as equivalent to gross
national income (GNI) per capita; this is considered to be a conservative measure because it accounts for

    The six interventions are promotion of good infant and young child nutrition and hygiene practices, vitamin A supplementation,
        therapeutic zinc supplementation with oral rehydration solution, deworming, public provision of complementary food for the

only the economic and not the social value of a year of life. In order to estimate the value of the reduction
in stunting, we follow the methodology used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), which values a year of life lived
without stunting based on the assumption that stunted individuals lose an average of 66 percent of lifetime
earnings. Increases in productivity only affect the portion of income coming from labor. To account for this,
based on Lubker (2007), we assume that 52 percent of income comes from labor. Future benefits are then
age-adjusted and discounted at three potential discount rates (3, 5, and 7 percent) in order to arrive at their
present values. The present value of future benefits is then compared with the annual public and donor
investment required, which allows us to estimate the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return of
the investment. A detailed explanation of the benefit estimation methodology can be found in Appendix 5.

The annual increase in economic productivity attributable to each package of interventions is calculated
based on the same estimates of future benefits. Although these benefits occur only once beneficiaries have
reached productive age, we assume that they serve as an approximation of the present value of economic
productivity lost each year as a result of mortality and morbidity that would otherwise be zero.

When estimating the costs and benefits of scaling up nutrition interventions, we begin with estimates for
scaling all 11 interventions to full national coverage (Scenario 0), followed by estimates for three less-costly
scale-up scenarios. The full coverage estimates can be considered the medium-term policy goal for the
Government of Kenya. However, resource constraints will likely limit the government‚Äôs ability to achieve full
national coverage in the short term. Therefore we also consider several scenarios for prioritizing the scale-
up of nutrition interventions over the short-term time frame of five years:

    ‚Ä¢   Scenario 1: Prioritize scale up by county group
    ‚Ä¢   Scenario 2: Prioritize scale up by intervention
    ‚Ä¢   Scenario 3: Prioritize scale up by county group and by intervention

After our presenting results for each scenario, we compare the scenarios and identify the most attractive
scale-up scenarios.

   PART III ‚Äì RESULTS FOR NUTRITION-SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS
                    TOTAL COST, EXPECTED BENEFITS, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS

The total additional public and donor investment required to scale up 11 nutrition-specific interventions from
current coverage levels to full coverage nationwide (Scenario 0) in Kenya is estimated to be $76 million
annually (Table 4). This includes the additional cost of scaling up all 11 interventions across the entire
country from current levels ($85 million per year), plus additional resources for overhead which we assumed
would be 11 percent of total costs, or $9.3 million. This includes 9 percent for capacity development for
program delivery, which may include information management, program coordination, and advocacy, and
2 percent for M&E, operations research, and technical support. Of this total amount, part of the costs for
iron fortification, multiple micronutrient powders, salt iodization, and complementary food would be covered
by private households with incomes above the poverty line, resulting in an annual financing gap of $76
million required to reach full national scale. Costs by county are presented in Appendix 6.

Note: n.a. = not applicable. M&E = monitoring and evaluation; ORS = oral rehydration solution. Full coverage refers to the full
implementation of all 11 interventions countrywide.
* The analysis assumes that households living above the poverty line will cover their costs for iron fortification, multiple micronutrient
powders, salt iodization, and complementary food. Therefore, these costs are not included in the total required public and done
investment.


The expected benefits from scaling up these 11 nutrition-specific interventions across the entire country
are enormous (Table 5): over 455,000 DALYs would be averted and 5,000 lives would be saved annually,
while more almost 700,000 cases of stunting among children under five would be averted.

For the package as a whole, we estimate the total cost per DALY averted to be $209, the total cost per life
saved to be about $18,700, and the total cost per case of stunting averted to be $136 (Table 5). 12 Variation
in cost-effectiveness among the interventions is high, with costs per DALY averted ranging from $43 for
Vitamin A supplementation to $869 for the public provision of complementary foods. Overall, these cost
estimates translate into an increase in annual public resource requirements of $10.54 per child under five.
This compares favorably to global estimates of $30 per child calculated by the World Bank (2010).

All 11 proposed nutrition-specific interventions are very cost-effective according to the WHO/CHOICE
criteria (WHO 2014a). As shown in Table 5, these 11 intervention are very cost-effective in that the cost
per DALY averted is below the Kenyan GDP per capita of $1,358 in 2014 (World Bank 2014). Although
public provision of complementary food is cost-effective with the cost per DALY averted estimated of $869,
it is the least cost-effective of the 11 interventions considered. In countries such as Kenya where fiscal and
capacity constraints limit scale-up, the public provision of complementary foods may be a lower priority.
Issues of governance, accountability, and supply logistics further constrain the scale-up of the public
provision of complementary food.




12 For the total cost per benefit unit, we divide the total annual program cost for all 11 interventions (including M&E and capacity
development costs, but before subtracting household contributions) by the benefits estimates available. Because of limitations of
LiST, DALYs averted estimates are available for only seven interventions, lives saved estimates are available for six interventions,
and stunting reduction estimates are available for three interventions.

Scenario 1: Scaling Up by County Group
In scenario 1, we consider targeting resources by geography, with a focus on counties with the highest
prevalence of malnutrition as measured by stunting. We divided the counties into three categories: (a)
highest-burden counties with stunting rates that exceed 30 percent (nine counties); 13 (b) middle-burden
counties with stunting rates between 20 percent and 29 percent (28 counties) 14; and (c) lowest-burden
counties with stunting rates of less than 20 percent (10 counties). Even though the criteria for these county
grouping was based on chronic malnutrition (stunting), all counties with acute malnutrition or wasting above
10 percent 15 are included in the ‚Äúhighest and middle burden categories‚Äù, with the exception of Garissa,
which has a low stunting burden (15.6 percent) but a high wasting burden (11.4 percent). Addressing
wasting in Garissa will require targeted interventions to address both wasting and stunting. (See Appendix
1 for stunting and wasting rates by county).

Scaling up the full set of interventions in the highest- and middle-burden counties would require an annual
public and donor investment of $61.9 million, avert almost 385,000 DALYs, and save over 4,000 lives (Table
6). For this scenario, the cost per DALY saved would be $198 and the cost per life saved would be
$17,714. 16 Program coverage would also be expanded as shown in Table 11.

Scenario 2: Scaling Up by Intervention
Scenario 2 considers a step-wise scale-up by intervention. Prioritizing some interventions before others is
based on cost-effectiveness and implementation capacity, as discussed in Scaling Up Nutrition (World Bank
2010). In this scenario we propose prioritizing two steps in the scale up, as detailed below and illustrated
in Figure 9.

       ‚Ä¢     Step 1 focuses on a package of primarily preventive interventions that can be scaled up quickly,
             either with existing capacities or with modest investment in capacity-building for community nutrition
             programs and child health days. It also includes scaling up the treatment of moderate and severe

     Cost per benefit unit is based on the total cost of $76 million for Scenario 1 (all direct, capacity development, M&E, operations
        research and technical support costs before subtracting household contributions).




                                                                  21
          acute malnutrition to 30 percent coverage from current coverage levels. The cost of Step 1 is $52.2
          million. An additional $4.7 million for capacity development and $1.0 million for M&E, operations
          research, and technical support is budgeted, which brings the total cost of Step 1 to $57.9 million.
          The portion of scale-up costs that could be covered by households above the poverty line is
          estimated at $7.4 million. Therefore the total public and donor investment required for Step 1
          is estimated at $50.5 million.
     ‚Ä¢    Step 2 includes the cost of scaling up the treatment for moderate and severe acute malnutrition
          from a base of 30 percent accomplished in Step 1 to 80 percent coverage (i.e. an additional 50
          percent coverage), with the assumption that additional implementation capacities are built in Step
          1. While treatment of severe acute malnutrition is relatively more expensive, it is known to be very
          effective. The estimated cost of this scale-up is $9.0 million. We also include an additional $0.8
          million for capacity development and $0.2 million for M&E, operations research, and technical
          support and in Step 2, which brings the total public and donor investment required for Step 2
          to $10.0 million. (There is no household contribution for these interventions because it is assumed
          that households could not cover these costs.)
One intervention is excluded from this scenario: the public provision of complementary foods to prevent
moderate malnutrition among children under 2 years of age. This intervention is given lowest priority for
multiple reasons, mainly that ‚Äì at $869 per DALY averted it is not nearly as cost effective as the
interventions included in Steps 1 and 2. In addition, governance, accountability, supply chain, and logistics
are key challenges associated with large-scale food distribution. The estimated benefits do not outweigh
these risks, and the costs are high compared with other interventions. Under these circumstances and in a
resource-constrained setting, priority scale-up is neither feasible nor recommended.

Note: There is no household contribution for Step 2 interventions.


Scaling up Step 1 and Step 2 interventions would require an annual public and donor investment of $60.5
million. As shown in Table 7, this would avert over 375,000 DALYs and save over 4,000 lives. For this

scenario, the cost per DALY saved would be $181 and the cost per life saved would be $15,853. 17 Program
coverage would also be substantially expanded (see Table 11).

Scenario 3: Scaling Up by County Group and Intervention
Scenario 3 is a hybrid of Scenarios 1 and 2 and proposes the scaling up by county and by selected
intervention as shown in Table 8. The preferred scenario is to scale up Step 1 and Step 2 interventions in
counties where stunting rates exceed 20 percent (highest- and middle-burden counties). This scenario
requires an annual public and donor investment of $47.8 million, averts over 294,000 DALYs and saves
over 3,300 lives. The cost per DALY averted would be $179 and the cost per life saved would be
$15,674. 18 The additional beneficiaries reached with the program expansion are shown in Table 11.

Our analysis estimates the costs and benefits of scaling up to full coverage for all 11 interventions
nationwide as well as 3 smaller-scale scale up scenarios. Table 9 provides an overview of the interventions
and counties included in each scenario.

When considered in terms of total resource requirement and cost-effectiveness (cost per benefit unit),
Scenarios 2 and 3 stand out as the most attractive. Table 10 presents a comparison of the costs and
benefits of the scale-up of all interventions nationwide and the three scenarios. Scenario 3 is the most cost-
effective in terms of cost per DALY averted of $179 and it is also the least costly overall ($48 million per
year). It would avert over 294,000 DALYs and save over 3,000 lives. However, Scenario 3 would only
deliver services in counties with the highest rates of stunting, making it less politically feasible. Scenario 2
requires more resources ($61 million) but provides services nationally and is almost as cost-effective (cost

                           ESTIMATED COSTS OVER A FIVE-YEAR SCALE-UP PERIOD
Recognizing the difficulty of scaling to full coverage in one year, we consider the costs of scaling up over
five years for all scenarios (Table 12). Over five years, the full coverage scenario would require an
investment of $213 million, and the lower cost scenarios would range between $173 million over 5 years
(Scenario 1) and $135 million (scenario 3). As shown in the table, interventions are assumed to scale from
current coverage as follows: 20 percent of scale up in Year 1, 40 percent in Year 2, 60 percent in Year 3,
80 percent in Year 4, and 100 percent in Year 5. To make these calculations, we consider the expenditures
on capacity development and system strengthening required to scale to full coverage to be a fixed cost,
with some additional funds allocated to refresher training and rehiring in the years after scale has been
reached. Thus the average annual amount spent on capacity development is allocated across the five years
rather than increasing in proportion to coverage, which is the case with the other costs.

                     ESTIMATED ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

A high burden of stunting negatively impacts a nation‚Äôs human capital. An investment in improving nutrition
outcomes among Kenyan children is therefore also an investment in the country‚Äôs economic future. The
two main ways in which stunting affects economic productivity are increased mortality and morbidity‚Äîin
other words, lives lost and years lived with a disease or disability. For the purposes of this analysis, we
estimate the potential economic benefits of scaling up nutrition interventions in terms of lives saved
(reduction in mortality) and cases of stunting averted (reduction in morbidity). Because each life lost results
in one less citizen contributing to the nation‚Äôs economy, and because stunted children tend to earn and
consume less, these impact estimates help us to arrive at approximations of the return on investment
attributable to the scale-up of a particular package of interventions.

The economic benefits of investing in these effective nutrition interventions are tremendous (Table 13).
Scaling up all 11 interventions nationwide could produce an increase of $458 million in economic
productivity over the productive lives of the children affected. (Because of methodological limitations, we
were not able to calculate the increases in economic productivity for the other scenarios.)

These estimates of economic benefits are based on a conservative methodology that does not necessarily
account for all of the potential benefits associated with improving nutrition outcomes among Kenyan
children. For example, these figures do not account for future growth in GDP per capita, which would also
be expected to increase with improved nutritional outcomes. Furthermore, it is likely that these estimated
increases in GDP would also improve equity in Kenya because productivity among the poor would benefit
the most from improved nutritional outcomes.

Our analyses also show that this package of nutrition interventions is an excellent economic investment.
Because an increase in the assumed discount rate reduces the present value of future benefits, we present
the results using three possible discount rates: 3, 5, and 7 percent. We estimate highly positive net present
values across this range of discount rates, indicating that this package is an excellent economic investment.
In addition, the investment would yield a highly positive internal rate of return of 22 percent, another indicator
that it is an excellent economic investment. We estimate a benefit-cost ratio of between 14 and 39
depending on the discount rate. At the discount rate of 5 percent, we estimate that every dollar invested in
this set of nutrition interventions has the potential to result in 22 dollars in economic returns. This result is

somewhat higher than the 18 reported in the literature, 19 mainly because benefit-cost ratios are heavily
depend on a country‚Äôs income level and Kenya‚Äôs is relatively high.

                                     UNCERTAINTIES AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

Because actual unit costs may differ from our estimates, it is important to consider the effects of either an
increase or decrease in these costs on the overall price of the interventions. This uncertainty is greatest for
higher-cost interventions, and less significant for those with lower-costs. For example, given the prevalence
of information on and experience with the less-expensive micronutrient and deworming interventions, there
is a relatively high degree of certainty around their estimated costs and financing needs. On the other hand,
the costs of promotion of good infant and young child nutrition and hygiene practices can vary greatly
depending on the context, with the intensity of behavior change campaigns, the number of community
health workers employed, and the amount of incentives provided to them, all affecting unit costs. Finally,
there is very little information concerning the costs of public provision of complementary food for prevention
of moderate acute malnutrition. As mentioned earlier, Kenya does have interventions in place to manage
moderate acute malnutrition, but there is no wide-scale program for the public provision of complementary
food. Unit costs depend on unknown factors such as the choice of targeting method and other factors that
include widespread governance concerns and diversion of the food supplies. To account for these
uncertainties, we perform a partial sensitivity analysis that describes the impact of variation in unit costs
while holding other variables constant. These results are presented in Appendix 7.

     Hoddinott and colleagues (2013) estimated the benefit-cost ratios for investing in nutrition for 17 high-burden countries and
        reported a median of 18 (for Bangladesh). The range they reported was 4 for the Democratic Republic of Congo and 48 for
        Indonesia.




                                                                27
            PART V ‚Äì CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Systematic costing of highly effective nutrition interventions is important for priority setting, resource
mobilization, and advocacy. Combining costing with estimates of impact (in terms of lives saved, DALYs
averted, and cases of stunting averted) and cost-effectiveness analysis will make the case for investment
in nutrition stronger and will aid in priority-setting by identifying the most cost-effective packages of
interventions in situations where financing is constrained. This will potentially be a powerful evidence-based
advocacy tool for policy makers‚Äîfor example, it can assist the National Treasury to make efficient budget
allocations because it provides useful evidence on what the government can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù (in terms of lives saved,
DALYs averted, or cases of stunting averted) given available resources.

Reaching full national coverage of the 11 nutrition-specific interventions would require $76 million. This
amount is equivalent to roughly 3 percent of the current (2014) public health expenditure in Kenya. Because
it is unlikely that the government or its partners can allocate these resources, we consider strategies that
make the most of the resources available. The report findings and recommendations are based on cost-
benefit analyses that can help policy makers prioritize the allocation of resources more effectively to achieve
maximum impact. The recommendations of this report represent a compromise between the need to
increase coverage and the constraints imposed by limited resources and capacities. The most cost-effective
scenarios would scale up 10 of the 11 interventions (excluding the public provision of complementary food)
to full coverage levels. Whether these interventions are scaled up nationwide or only in 37 high burden
counties will depend on the level of resources available for nutrition interventions. We estimate that
expanding coverage of these 10 interventions would cost between $48 and $61 million, depending on how
many counties are included in the scale-up. If scaled up nationwide, over 4,000 lives could be saved and
over 375,000 DALYs could be averted from these 10 interventions. Recognizing the challenges of scaling
to full coverage in one year, we estimate the investment required to scale up over five years to be $213
million to scale up all interventions nationwide to full coverage levels. The estimated cost over five years to
scale up the 10 most cost-effective interventions nationwide is $171 million, and to scale up those 10
interventions in only the highest-burden counties is $135 million. An important next step will be to identify
sources of funding for these key nutrition interventions.

These investments in nutrition could yield tremendous economic benefits for Kenya. The full scale-up
annual investment of $76 million has the potential to increase economic productivity over the productive
lives of the beneficiaries by $458 million and yield an impressive rate of return on the investment of 22
percent. The investment would also yield large net present values of between $2.3 and $7.4 billion,
depending on the discount rate assumed. The benefit-cost ratio of the investment is 22 (assuming a 5
percent discount rate), which means that every dollar invested in nutrition interventions has the potential to
result in 22 dollars in economic returns.

Although every attempt has been made to use actual costs for these estimates, the costs estimated here
are likely to be slight overestimates, while the benefits are likely to be underestimated, as discussed earlier.
Another limitation of the analysis is that it does not capture differences in costs across counties. In a large
country such as Kenya, we would expect a wide range in actual costs because they depend in part on
population density, available infrastructure, and other factors.

Program management costs, in particular the costs of capacity building and M&E were estimated only
indirectly, as a percentage of the total cost, based on the methodology presented in detail in World Bank
(2010). Estimating program cost directly for each interventions was not possible given the resource and
time constraints. UNICEF used an alternative approach for calculating program costs, based on the review
of the costing of the Kenyan national multi-sectoral nutrition plan (UNICEF, 2015). UNICEF‚Äôs program cost
estimates included the cost of program-specific human resources (for example, program managers and
administrative staff), training, supervision, M&E, communication and media outreach, advocacy, and
general program development activities. Based on this methodology, estimated program costs accounted
for about 37 percent of the total cost or as much as 60 percent of the costs estimated for the direct nutrition
interventions. It may be argued this methodology include some costs that are not directly linked to the high
impact nutrition interventions (e.g. the management of the national nutrition program or nutrition advocacy



                                                    28
efforts) and therefore over-estimates the program costs. On the other hand, the methods used by UNICEF
is much more direct than the one used in this study and indicates that our assumption that capacity
development and M&E account for only 11 percent of the cost of the nutrition specific interventions may be
overly optimistic. Future studies should try to capture programmatic cost more directly.

We assumed that the relationship between cost and coverage is constant, that is, as the coverage
increases, marginal costs (cost or reaching one additional beneficiary) remain the same. This may not be
the case. It is possible that, as program expand, due to economies of scales, marginal cost may decrease.
On the other hand, it is also possible that the marginal cost will increase once all the easy-to-reach
beneficiaries are covered and the program will have to expand to hard-to-reach populations and
geographies. To date no studies have analyzed the relationship between cost and coverage of nutrition
interventions. It should be a kay area for future analysis

This report focuses on incremental financial costs of expanding the current coverage of the interventions.
We have assumed that the necessary infrastructure (for example, health facilities, human resources for
health) necessary for such scale up will be available as the health system infrastructure in Kenya grows.
However, in order to implement the scale up of nutrition interventions it will be necessary to understand
better whether the existing capacity is truly sufficient and what non-financial resources are needed the
coverage of the interventions. Another issue to be explored in future analyses is what the most effective
and cost-effective service delivery modalities for the high impact nutrition interventions are and what
allocations of resources among interventions allows for reaching the maximum impact while minimizing the
cost (allocative efficiency analysis).

Even though this report focuses exclusively on nutrition-specific interventions, the causes of malnutrition
are multisectoral, so any longer-term approach to improving nutrition outcomes must also include nutrition-
sensitive interventions. An important next step will be to extend the cost-effectiveness to nutrition-sensitive
interventions implemented outside of the health sector. More robust data on nutrition-sensitive interventions
are needed to do this.

Overall, the findings of this report point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions that represent a
cost-effective approach to reducing the high levels of child malnutrition in Kenya. Crucial next steps are for
the Government of Kenya and its partners to develop a road map of key actions and to identify milestones
in addressing undernutrition in Kenya.

                      APPENDIX 3: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING COSTS FOR KENYA

The following steps lay out the methodology used to estimate costs for each intervention:

1. Describe each intervention.
2. Define target populations for each intervention.
3. Estimate the size of the target populations for each intervention in each county using the most current
   demographic data.
4. Specify the delivery platform or channel(s) for each intervention, based on the county context and the
   accepted delivery modes.
5. Identify data on the current coverage levels for each intervention in each county.
6. Estimate the unit cost per beneficiary for each intervention from program experience in Kenya.
   Calculate additional costs of scaling up to full coverage by multiplying the unit cost for each intervention
   with the size of the ‚Äúuncovered‚Äù target population for each intervention by county. The formula for
   calculation is:

         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 = Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ß1 (100 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ßÌ†µÌ±ß2 )

where:

         x1 = additional costs of scaling up to full coverage
         z1 = unit cost per beneficiary
         z2 = current coverage level (percentage)

7. Estimate additional resources for (1) capacity development for program delivery and (2) M&E,
   operations research, and technical support, estimated at 9 percent and 2 percent of total cost of
   interventions, respectively.
8. Estimate a portion of the total cost that can be covered by private household resources. It is assumed
   that households above the poverty line could cover their own cost of iron fortification, multiple
   micronutrient powders, salt iodization, and complementary food from private resources.
9. Calculate the annual public and donor investment required to scale up these interventions to full
   coverage using the following formula:

         Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å = (Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 + Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 ) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3

         where:

         Y = annual public and donor investment required to scale up to full coverage
         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•1 = additional total cost to scale up to full coverage
         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•2 = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
         Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±•3 = cost covered by households living above poverty line for selected interventions

Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except the treatment of
severe acute malnutrition, which is set to 80 percent. This is consistent with World Bank (2010) methods
and is based on the reality that few community-based treatment programs have successfully achieved more
than 80 percent coverage at scale.

                             OF STUNTING AVERTED

Estimating DALYs averted

To estimate the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted from each intervention, the lives saved, and
stunting cases averted are first modeled using LiST. 20 LiST is a part of an integrated set of tools that
comprise the Spectrum policy modeling system. Once the demographic and health data have been
updated, the coverage and scale-up plan for each intervention is introduced into LiST. The table below
presents data sources.

LiST can estimate the impact of each intervention in isolation from other implemented interventions or can
calculate the simultaneous impact of a set of interventions implemented at the same time. The second,
simultaneous method is likely to yield slightly lower estimates because interventions may have overlapping
benefits. In this analysis we present both the individual/isolated results of the individual interventions for full
coverage (with totals calculated using the simultaneous method) and the simultaneous impact in the various
scale-up scenarios.

For each intervention, deaths averted are disaggregated by cause of death. To estimate the impact of
interventions in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALY), years of life lost (YLL), and years lost to
disability (YLD) are estimated separately:

         (YLL averted)CoD = (Deaths averted)CoD * (Life expectancy at average age of death)CoD
                              (Total YLL averted)intervention = ‚àë(YLL averted)CoD

         (YLD averted)CoD = (YLL averted)CoD * [(Total annual YLD)CoD / (Total annual YLL)CoD]
                             (Total YLD averted)intervention = ‚àë(YLD averted) CoD

where

         CoD = cause of death


For each cause of death impacted by an intervention, YLL averted are calculated as a product of the number
of deaths averted and the average age at death from that cause (Yang et al. 2013). Results from the 2013
update of Global Burden of Disease (IHME 2013) are used to create a ratio of age-specific total YLD and
total YLL for each cause of death in a country. This ratio is then used as a multiplier for YLL averted to
estimate the YLD averted for each cause (Montagu et al. 2013; Weinberger, Fry, and Hopkins 2015). For
curative interventions, it is assumed that there will be some disability prior to provision of the intervention
and the intervention will only avert half of the YLD.

DALYs averted by each intervention is estimated as the sum of YLL averted and YLD averted across all
causes of death impacted by a given intervention:

         (DALY averted)intervention = (total YLL averted)intervention + (total YLD averted)intervention

The estimated DALYs averted will be presented as such (for example, undiscounted) and will also be
discounted by 3 percent, which is the standard discount rate for health interventions and is also
recommended by the WHO for cost-effectiveness analysis (WHO 2014a). Sensitivity analysis will be
performed by varying the discount rate between 0 percent and 6 percent, as recommended by the WHO.

Estimating Lives Saved

The projected number of lives saved is also calculated using LiST, which translates measured coverage
changes into estimates of reductions in mortality. Because of limitations in LiST, the calculation for the
number of lives saved is based on only six of the 11 interventions; 21 thus our estimates are likely to
underestimate the actual number of lives saved.




21 The six interventions are Promotion of good infant and young child nutrition and hygiene practices, vitamin A

supplementation, therapeutic zinc supplementation with oral rehydration solution, iron-folic acid supplementation, the
public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, and community-based
treatment of severe acute malnutrition.


                                                           38
Estimating Cases of Stunting Averted

In order to estimate the number of cases of under-five stunting averted attributable to the annual investment
in the scaling up of nutrition interventions, we use LiST to model changes in the prevalence of stunting over
five years, during which the interventions are projected to have reached 100 percent of the target
population. Next, we model changes in the prevalence of stunting over five years with no scale-up of the
interventions. We then take the difference between the estimated stunting prevalence in Year 5 with the
scale up and the prevalence in Year 5 absent the scale-up, and multiply this percentage point difference by
the total population of children under five years of age.

Our reason for using stunting prevalence in Year 5 relates to the assumptions built into the LiST model,
which assumes that stunting is itself a risk factor for becoming stunted in the next time period. As a result,
stunting prevalence remains flat during the first two years of the scale-up, before dropping precipitously
until Year 5, after which the prevalence begins to level out. We assume that continuing investments in
maintaining scale after Year 5 will serve to maintain the gains in stunting prevalence reduction, and
therefore we present this reduction as a benefit attributable to a one-year investment in scaling up nutrition.

On the other hand, when estimating stunting reduction (and lives saved) attributable to a five- year scale-
up plan, we model this scale-up directly in LiST and use the annual results over five years in our cost-
benefit analysis. Using annual results over five years provides a more accurate portrayal of the direct
benefits attributable to a five-year scale up plan, and it does not assume that the scale will necessarily be
maintained following the end of the period covered in the plan.

The estimate of cases of childhood stunting averted is based on four of the 11 interventions, 22 because of
limitations in the LiST model. As such, our estimates are likely to underestimate the number of cases of
childhood stunting averted.




22The four interventions are Promotion of good infant and young child nutrition and hygiene practices, vitamin A
supplementation, iron-folic acid supplementation, and the public provision of complementary food for the prevention of
moderate acute malnutrition.

                   APPENDIX 5: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING ECONOMIC BENEFITS

There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the best methodology for monetizing the value of a
life saved. In this analysis, we focus solely on the economic value of a life year, which we measure as equal
to GNI per capita. Other studies attempt to estimate the social value of a life year as well as its economic
value; because we do not, we acknowledge that our results underestimate the true value of a life year
saved.

Still, valuing years of life saved alone does not account for the economic benefits of reduced morbidity,
which include the long-term, nonlethal impacts of malnutrition on individuals. Although there are a number
of long-term impacts of nutritional deficiencies, we choose to focus on stunting because of the availability
of country-specific impact estimates produced by LiST. 23

In order to estimate the economic value of a case of childhood stunting averted, we follow the methodology
used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), who begin by assuming that stunted individuals lose an average of 66
percent of lifetime earnings, based on direct estimates of the impact of stunting in early life on later life
outcomes found in Hoddinott et al. (2011). 24 This estimate for the effects of stunting on future consumption
is used as a proxy for the effect of stunting on lifetime earnings. Additionally, Hoddinott et al. (2013) account
for uncertainty by assuming that only 90 percent of the total gains will be realized, which we also include in
our calculations. However, unlike those authors, we adjust our calculations to reflect the country‚Äôs labor
force participation rate. Finally, we also assume that productivity increases due to stunting reductions only
apply to the proportion of income coming from labor and wages. There are no reliable country-specific
estimates of the proportion of income from labor in Kenya. Therefore, we use a conservative rate of 52
percent based on ILO assessment form OECD countries (Lubker, 2007).

For both lives saved and cases of stunting averted, the benefits of a five-year scale-up plan are attributed
to a group of children that is assumed to enter the labor force at age 15 and exit the labor force at age 57,
which is equivalent to life expectancy at birth in Zambia. Benefits from both stunting and lives saved are
then multiplied by a lifetime discount factor (LDF) in order to obtain the present value of benefits incurred
during the expected years of productivity (years between the age of entry into and exit from the workforce).
The LDF is derived from three potential discount rates (3 percent, 5 percent, and 7 percent), an adjustment
for age at the time of investment (for simplicity, we assume an average age of two years for all children),
and the years of lifetime productivity expected. The LDF represents the years of productivity that are
‚Äúcounted‚Äù in the calculation, discounted back to their present value in the year in which the investment in
nutrition is made. Because we assume an average age of two years for all beneficiaries, we use an LDF
that assumes that these children will enter the labor force 13 years from the time of investment. Importantly,
given the time frame considered under this analysis, we do not attempt to account for projected growth in
the country‚Äôs GDP and per capita incomes. This downward bias contributes to the conservative nature of
our estimates.

The following equations are used to estimate (1) the economic value of lives saved (reduced mortality) and
(2) increased future productivity (reduced morbidity):



       1. Present value of reduced mortality = (lives saved attributable to intervention scale-up)
               *(GNI per capita) * LDF



23
     It should be noted that because stunting is just one of many long-term consequences of poor nutrition, actual
         economic benefits of improving nutrition may be much higher than estimated here.
24   Hoddinott et al. (2011) provided direct estimates of the impact of stunting in early life on later life outcomes, which
       found that an individual stunted at age 36 months had, on average, 66 percent lower per capita consumption
       over his or her productive life.

    2. Present value of reduced morbidity = (cases of child stunting averted)
            * (coefficient of a deficit) * (percent of income actually realized) * (GNI per capita)
            * (LDF)

where:

    ‚Ä¢    Lives saved attributable to the intervention scale-up are estimated using LiST.
    ‚Ä¢    Cases of child stunting averted are calculated by subtracting the projected under-five stunting
         prevalence ( percent) after the interventions are scaled up calculated by LiST from the projected
         stunting prevalence under a scenario with no scale up and multiplying it by the total under-five
         population.
    ‚Ä¢    The coefficient of deficit is equal to the reduction in lifetime earnings attributable to stunting.
    ‚Ä¢    The lifetime discount factor (LDF) is used to discount future benefits to their value at the time of
         investment. It is derived from a discount rate, age at the time of investment and the estimated age
         of entry and exit into the workforce. The equation used to calculate the LDF is:

                            Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°=13



         where:

          LDF = the lifetime discount factor
             r = is the discount rate
             t = the time period since the initial investment in scaling up the interventions (we assume that
             children are 2 years old at the time of investment and enter the labor force at 15 years old,
             which is reflected in the starting value for t)
             T = the last time period before individuals exit the labor force (we assume individuals are out
             of the workforce at life expectancy at birth)



Note that the beginning time period t and ending period T is adjusted for each cohort based on the year of
investment. For example, the first cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time period t=13 and exit at
time T, the second cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time period t=14 and exit at time T+1, and
so forth.

Finally, the annual addition to economic productivity is measured by taking the total economic benefits for
the year in which all beneficiaries of the initial one-year investment have reached productive age. These
benefits are not discounted back to their present value, as they are considered the annual opportunity cost
of not investing in scaling up nutrition interventions. It should be noted that these benefits are derived from
a progressive, five-year scale-up plan, and therefore subsequent investments that maintain the target scale
will increase the total annual benefits as new beneficiaries are reached.

This paper builds on global experience and Kenya‚Äôs specific context to identify an effective approach to scaling up
nutrition and provide an estimate of costs and benefits of key nutrition interventions. It is intended to help guide the
selection of the most cost-effective interventions as well as strategies for scaling up a package of interventions
tailored to Kenya‚Äôs specific needs. The paper considers high-impact ‚Äúnutrition-specific‚Äù interventions that largely rely
on typical health sector delivery mechanisms. We estimate that the costs and benefits of implementing 11 critical
nutrition-specific interventions would require a yearly public and donor investment of $76 million. The expected
benefits would be substantial: annually more than 455,000 DALYs would be averted, over 5,000 lives saved, and
more than almost 700,000 cases of stunting among children under five averted. This investment would be very cost-
effective with an estimated cost per DALY averted of $207 cost per life saved of about $18,600 and a cost per case
of stunting averted of $135 Economic productivity could potentially increase by $458 million over the productive lives
of beneficiaries. However, we also calculate intermediate scale-up scenarios since it may not be feasible for the
Government of Kenya or its partners to achieve full coverage in the near term. We compare the costs and benefits
associated with three different scenarios: first, prioritizing counties, focusing the investment on counties with a high
burden of stunting; second, prioritizing interventions, focusing on only a subset of the most effective interventions;
and third, prioritizing both counties and interventions, delivering only the most effective subset of interventions to
high-burden counties. We determined that the third scenario is the most cost-effective and least costly. Scaling up
the most cost-effective interventions in 37 high-burden counties would avert almost 295,000 DALYs and save over
3,000 lives per year for an annual public and donor investment of $48 million.

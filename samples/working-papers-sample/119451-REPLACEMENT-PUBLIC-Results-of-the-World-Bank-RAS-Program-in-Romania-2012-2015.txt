The World Bank Romania Country Office commissioned this evaluation of the Romania RAS
program for the 2012-2015 programming period to assess how effectively the World Bank is
contributing to the achievement of development objectives in collaboration with the Government
of Romania. The report was written by Dawn Roberts (independent consultant) and András
Tamás Torkos under the guidance of Corina Mirabela Grigore and Suzy Yoon-Yildiz. Oana
Maria Caraba provided invaluable assistance developing graphs to communicate the results.
Elisabetta Capannelli, Country Manager for Romania and Hungary provided overall leadership
for the study.

Many people provided valuable inputs throughout the evaluation and reporting process. The
authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of client counterparts in the Government of
Romania and other key stakeholders who agreed to be interviewed and provided candid
reflections about the RAS implementation experience and outcomes during a mission in May
2016. Members of the Romania Portfolio Team helped to identify key documents and
stakeholders and schedule interviews. World Bank task team leaders (TTLs) provided detailed
survey responses and worked with the evaluation team as needed to fill information gaps. RAS
results in the report reflect updates provided by teams through December 2016.

Finally, this report has benefited greatly from an in-depth review process. Sara Okada and Izlem
Yenice served as peer reviewers and Antony Thompson (Country Manager for Bulgaria) chaired
a constructive review discussion to strengthen the findings and recommendations. The authors
are also grateful for having had the opportunity to present the RAS evaluation framework to the
Results Management and Evaluation Stream community during the RMES Together event in
May 2017, which provided important feedback that allowed the finalization of this report.

Executive Summary
Background
In October 2015, the World Bank Romania Country Office commissioned an evaluation of its
reimbursable advisory services (RAS) program for the 2012-2015 period. The program included 39
RAS agreements conducted with line ministries, government agencies and local authorities for a
total value of approximately $59 million.

The conceptual approach for the evaluation was based on the Capacity Development Results
Framework (CDRF) to explore how RAS outcomes extend beyond the knowledge and skills gained
at an individual or group level to strengthen institutional capacity. According to the CDRF, analytic
and advisory services are designed to contribute to one or more of three types of institutional
capacity, including the strength of stakeholder ownership (the sociopolitical environment), the
efficiency of policy instruments, and the effectiveness of organizational arrangements. There should
be a program logic and evidence of intermediate outcomes that signal how a RAS is contributing to
strengthening institutional capacity over the longer term.

     RAS agreements are often designed to address more than one institutional capacity challenge
     blocking the achievement of a development goal. Two-thirds of the projects (26) addressed
     multiple challenges, according to the project documents and TTL input. As shown in Figure ii, the
     portfolio collectively addressed 54 challenges related to the effectiveness of organizational
     arrangements (37 projects), 34 challenges related to the efficiency of policy instruments (26
     projects), and 10 challenges related to the strength of stakeholder ownership (8 projects).

         Although more than half of the targeted challenges were related to organizational
         performance, RAS engagements were most effective overall for supporting the elaboration of
         policies and strategies. Ratings of “knowledge used? or even better results were achieved for a
         larger share (79%) of the identified challenges related to inefficient policy instruments (laws,
         regulations, strategies, etc.) compared to those related to ineffective organizational arrangements
         (56%) or weak stakeholder ownership (40%).

         Overall, RAS engagements reflected comprehensive support for public sector reform in
         Romania. The program directly served 15 client organizations at the national, regional, and county
         levels (figure iii). Organizations that benefitted included multiple units within more than 20
         ministries, agencies, commissions and other bodies of the GoR along with countless other
         institutions at the sub-national level. Examples of these include local municipalities and regional
         development agencies using new tools for spatial planning and urban development and school
         inspectorates in all 42 counties receiving new regulations and guidance for organization and
         functioning.

         Efficiency of Policy Instruments
         The collaboration between the World Bank and the Government of Romania was most
         effective for the elaboration of laws and strategies. Results assessed in terms of “more efficient
         policy instruments? included changes in legislation, regulations, strategies, standards or other
         formal incentives established to guide stakeholder actions more efficiently in pursuit of
         development goals. As shown in Figure iv, there were 34 identified capacity challenges related to
         policy instruments, and new knowledge acquired through RAS engagements was being used by
         stakeholders to address 26 of these.

These RAS results played a critical role for helping Romania to leverage EU funding for
achieving development objectives. Bank teams helped to elaborate strategies to satisfy ex-ante
conditionalities for accessing European funds for the 2014-2020 programming period related to
lifelong learning, reducing early school leaving, increasing tertiary education attainment, supporting
the elderly and active aging, and promoting social inclusion and poverty reduction. RAS outputs
also provided the coordination mechanisms to harmonize State and EU-funded projects for
integrated planning and development, informed the policy lines regarding integrated territorial
development for the Romanian Partnership agreement 2014-2020, and contributed to the design of
the Community Led Local Development and Sustainable Development priority axes for the new
Regional Operational Program. Some of the most notable progress achieved by these engagements
is described in Table i.

Effectiveness of Organizational Arrangements
RAS activities and outputs helped to strengthen the capacity of public sector organizations at
the national, regional and local levels. As shown in Figure iv, notable progress (where new
knowledge was being used) was documented in 29 instances, commonly contributing to an
organization’s increased operational efficiency, improved financial management, increased
adaptability, or better achievement of outcomes related to a development objective.

Most of the RAS results related to the effectiveness of organizational arrangements focused on
refining or reinventing administrative structures, systems, and/or processes. For example,
establishing criteria for prioritizing unfair competition cases will allow the Romanian Competition
Council to operate more efficiently in processing complaints about unfair commercial practices.
Local municipalities such as Alba Iulia are using new analytical approaches and tools for a more
efficient planning process, including pursuing inter-municipal planning with nearby cities and
setting criteria for project selection and prioritization. Assistance to the Ministry of Education and
Scientific Research included producing new regulations for organization and functioning to clarify
roles, functions and responsibilities across the pre-university school system. Some examples of
notable successes related to improving the effectiveness of organizational arrangements are in Table
ii.

ICT-based tools developed by RAS teams contributed to improved processes documented at
the organizational level. Of the 14 instances where ICT solutions were designed to address
institutional capacity constraints, half (7) contributed “knowledge used? or “capacity change
emerging.? An ICT prototype for institutional strategic planning and performance assessment
developed for the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is expected to be adapted and
used by other ministries to strengthen their strategic planning functions. An online monitoring and

Society for evidence-based decision-making. Assistance to the Romanian Competition Council
resulted in automation of the mergers process for improved operational efficiency.

Training activities alone were generally not adequate for building technical capacity in public
sector units. For example, the RAS for strengthening debt management included training on cash
management and liability operations, with participants demonstrating increased knowledge as a
short-term outcome. However, the RAS team observed that an internal reorganization was needed
within the General Directorate of the Treasury and Public Debt in order for the staff to apply the
new skills as intended. Other RAS training exercises were also expected to have a limited effect
without additional follow-on support, such as for monitoring the implementation of new national
strategies in the education sector, implementing a new methodology for managing public private
partnerships in the transport sector, and applying promising new sectoral analysis tools for climate-
related decision-making in the energy, transport, urban, and water sectors.

Strength of Stakeholder Ownership
RAS agreements implemented between 2012 and 2015 tended to focus on the supply
side. GoR requests for technical assistance were typically for help developing laws and strategies
or strengthening the administrative or technical capacity of an organization. However, these efforts
had limited success in cases where there was inadequate stakeholder buy-in and commitment for
participating in the process and implementing the recommendations, suggesting that more attention
should be paid to the demand side during RAS design.

Only eight RAS engagements included design elements to strengthen stakeholder ownership.
These institutional capacity results on the demand side included increasing the commitment of
leaders to the achievement of a development goal, improving the transparency of information,
increasing stakeholders’ demand for accountability from service providers, and changing
widespread practices. The progress for addressing ten challenges are shown in Figure v.

The portfolio was generally less effective in contributing to these demand-side changes. The
eight RAS agreements identified and targeted a total of ten capacity challenges related to the
strength of stakeholder ownership, but only four of these changes contributed a rating of
“knowledge used? or better progress. In all of the cases, the RAS design included components for
contributing to multiple institutional capacity changes, without the enhancement of stakeholder
ownership alone being a clear priority.

The more effective engagements provided some guidance for what works best in building
demand-side capacity. First, a continuous or iterative process rather than a one-off forum or event
is needed to foster broad stakeholder participation and commitment to the achievement of a
development objective. Second, new findings and concepts need broad dissemination through a
variety of formats to gain traction in shifting public awareness and attitudes. Third, a change on the
supply side—such as a new organizational mechanism or new legislation—can serve as an
important lever for strengthening stakeholder ownership. For example, the RAS providing support
for the establishment of a Delivery Unit included a mix of activities in the energy sector for
increasing the transparency of information and helping to ensure that consumers demand
accountability. Table iii provides examples of how RAS activities contributed to strengthening
stakeholder ownership.

Lessons
Progress related to developing more efficient policy instruments or stronger stakeholder
ownership is not achieved in isolation. Without exception, the RAS engagements producing
“knowledge used? or better outcomes for either of these areas also had at least one component
focused on enhancing the effectiveness of organizational arrangements. Even when outputs
designed to improve organizational arrangements did not result in stakeholders using the knowledge
provided, the supplementary support seemed to act as an important lever for helping the client to
develop and adopt new strategies and frameworks and to strengthen demand-side capacity.

An adequate authorizing environment on the client side is critical for strong RAS results. The
ten RAS agreements that did not achieve any instances of new knowledge use all suffered from
limited commitment, motivation, and/or institutional authority on the part of the client leadership
                                                           x
for supporting the delivery of RAS activities and implementing recommendations. Some examples
include the engagements focused on building capacity in the Ministry of Transport and
Infrastructure for public private partnerships, on the enhancement of risk-based systems for the
Operational Program for Human Resources Development, on support to the Ministry of Public
Finance to strengthen public investment management, and on the analysis of capacity building
activities in the public administration for the Managing Authority of the Operational Program for
Administrative Capacity Development.

Both high-level (political) and technical-level commitment is needed for RAS engagements to
be effective. Efforts to establish a Delivery Unit in the Center of Government were challenged by
the limited involvement of the Prime Minister at the time, Victor Ponta. For the assistance to the
Romanian Competition Council, the combination of high-level and technical-level commitment
yielded strong results for all identified institutional capacity challenges. In the Ministry of Public
Finance, there was strong technical-level commitment but more political commitment was needed
for implementing recommendations (i.e. reorganizing the Treasury, reforming public investment
management, etc.).

In addition to adequate commitment on the client side, other common success factors helped
to facilitate the achievement of RAS outcomes. These characteristics, listed in Box ii, were
frequently mentioned by both clients and Bank team members as key ingredients to help ensure the
desired RAS results. Most or all of the success factors were present for the 17 RAS engagements
that were found to have contributed to capacity
changes that were emerging or already in effect.             Box ii. Common Success Factors for

organizations. For the climate change RAS, changes
in the leadership and key staff of the Ministry of
Environment, Waters and Forests have contributed to the low implementation capacity of the
ministry. Frequent management changes at the National Agency for Cadastre and Land
Registration limit its institutional capacity to carry out its mandate as defined in the real estate RAS.
Similarly, changes in management at the Danube Delta Inter-Communal Development Association
(ADI) and staff turnover at the end of the ADI ITI Danube Delta RAS are likely to constrain the use
of RAS outputs.

Finally, the World Bank’s standard approach to reporting RAS results does not provide
useful information for understanding and tracking needed institutional changes. The Activity

associated theory of change through which to assess the quality and sustainability of outcomes. In
contrast, the CDRF-based approach to results measurement associates outcomes with an
institutional change objective to report on not only what progress was achieved but also what
progress is still needed.
Next Steps
Clients’ reflections on their RAS implementation experiences were very positive. Ideas for
strengthening the collaboration focused largely on how to further improve the evolving partnership
between the Bank and the GoR given the established trust and shared objectives. Recurring
recommendations included:
   Active negotiation and communication by both the Bank and the GoR at the start of the RAS;
   An emphasis on making RAS outputs (reports, strategic frameworks, etc.) to be “useable
    products? for the client;
   A more integrated approach to technical assistance to ensure that the client can apply the new
    knowledge and skills generated by RAS activities;
   A local point-of-contact and a good grasp of the changing local context throughout the RAS
    implementation period; and
   A plan from the start for engaging the right stakeholders.

Defining outcomes in terms of incremental progress along an institutional capacity change
pathway provides an immediate filter for relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability.
Reviewing the results of advisory services through the lens of the CDRF provides a meaningful
assessment of how the World Bank’s RAS Program is contributing to the achievement of
development objectives.

More work is needed to foster a productive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) culture within
the Bank’s RAS Program. To strengthen the focus on results, the Romania Country Office could
continue to refine this approach to build a common language related to institutional change,
integrate M&E tools throughout the RAS cycle, educate stakeholders about the value of M&E, and
create a system to disseminate and apply lessons from RAS implementation.

I.      Introduction

Background
In October 2015, the World Bank Romania Country Office commissioned an evaluation of its
reimbursable advisory services (RAS) program for the 2012-2015 period. The program included
39 RAS agreements conducted with line ministries, government agencies and local authorities
for a total value of approximately $59 million. The evaluation was designed to assess how
effectively the World Bank has been contributing to the achievement of development objectives
in collaboration with the Government of Romania (GoR) and to identify lessons for
improvement.

The RAS instrument is demand-driven, generated from client requests and then regulated by
separate legal agreements between the Bank and the recipients of the services. The access to
analytical and advisory skills provided by the RAS program and the options for financing,
technical cooperation, and knowledge services allow the Bank to engage with client countries as
a development partner to support complex structural reforms. The RAS portfolio is an integral
part of the Bank’s country program and is governed by all of the standard Bank policies and
quality assurance practices, including operational policies and safeguards.

In Romania, the reimbursable advisory service model was first used for a set of “functional
reviews? in 2010 and 2011 drawing on funding from the European Structural and Cohesion
funds to provide an independent assessment of key challenges in 13 ministries and government
agencies.1 This engagement was encouraged by the European Commission because of
Romania’s weaknesses in the public administration revealed by the financial crisis and low
absorption of European Union (EU) funds. The reviews diagnosed the structural bottlenecks to
growth and provided operational recommendations for capacity building. These
recommendations provided the foundation for action plans by the GoR for strengthening public
administration capacity and help the Government to prepare for the 2014-2020 period.

The successful completion of the functional reviews led to increased demand from the GoR for
reimbursable services under the then-established RAS instrument. The memorandum of
understanding (MOU) on “Partnership and Support in the Implementation of the EU Structural
and Cohesion Funds and Modernization of Public Administration in Romania? signed in 2012
between the GoR and the World Bank identified complementary areas of focus and targeted
support for the 2012-2015 period.

The RAS program has continued to grow since the signing of the MOU to address the evolving
needs of the Government. For example, World Bank RAS support has helped the GoR to satisfy
ex-ante conditionalities in preparation for the next financing cycle.2 RAS agreements covered by
this evaluation have been paid by the GoR using EU funds under five operational programs
between 2007-2013 with separate managing authorities:
1
  At that time, reimbursable advisory services were provided under the Fee-based Services instrument which was
launched as part of the Bank’s modernization agenda to respond to individual client country needs beyond the
traditional package of services. For more details, see Functional Reviews in Romania: Process and Results (World
Bank 2015).

  The European Structural and Cohesion Funds are now called the European Structural and Investment Funds
(ESIF).

       Operational Program for Human Resources Development (POSDRU),
       Regional Operational Program (POR),
       Operational Program for Technical Assistance (POAT),
       Operational Program for Administrative Capacity Development (PODCA), and
       Operational Program for Increased Economic Competitiveness (POSCCE).
The list of the 39 RAS agreements by operational program is in Annex 1.

The World Bank Romania RAS portfolio team systematically monitors program inputs, outputs,
and invoicing but has limited evidence to date of the longer-term outcomes of the RAS
engagements. Various challenges have limited the team’s ability to document RAS results. First,
RAS agreements are typically negotiated and implemented on a tight timeframe to address an
immediate client need, so the main emphasis has been on the successful delivery of the agreed
upon outputs and the level of client satisfaction. The envisioned institutional changes supported
by the analytic and advisory services often require more time than the duration of a RAS
agreement. In addition, the RAS program has spanned a period of relatively frequent political
transitions with a high level of turnover among personnel in the public sector. In many cases,
longer-term outcomes depend on the ongoing commitment of leadership to the development
process and on the career development of trained staff.

During FY15, a first-phase evaluation of the World Bank’s RAS Program in Romania focused
on four case studies to explore the outcomes, sustainability, accountability, and effectiveness of
RAS engagements. The methodology tested through this case study process was refined to allow
for this more comprehensive evaluation of the full RAS portfolio implemented in 2012-15.

Methodology
Building on the case study experience from FY15, the evaluation of the RAS program used a
mixed method design to provide a systematic, qualitative assessment of how RAS engagements
are contributing to the achievement of development objectives over time. Data sources included
a desk review of project documents using a standard template, a survey of the RAS task team
leaders (or their designated representatives) for reporting on RAS results and implementation
experiences, and in-depth interviews with 31 GoR counterparts and other RAS stakeholders. The
list of stakeholders interviewed is in Annex 2.

The conceptual approach for the evaluation was based on the Capacity Development Results
Framework (CDRF) to explore how RAS outcomes extend beyond the knowledge and skills
gained at an individual or group level to strengthen institutional capacity over time.3 This
approach was designed to complement existing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) practices used
for analytic and advisory services and to address the following key challenges to understanding
the results of the RAS program within Romania’s local development context:

          Standard ratings for RAS effectiveness lack objectivity and comparability across
           engagements. In the Activity Completion Summary, task team leaders are required to rate
           the progress of the activity in achieving its development objective using a 10-point scale.
           However, the rating levels are not well-defined and the self-reporting process allows for a
           high degree of subjectivity.
          Outcomes of project activities are assessed in isolation. As described in Table 1,
           common M&E approaches too often assess the individual outcomes of analytic and
           advisory services without tracking them within a longer-term theory of change. Progress
           in addressing an institutional capacity challenge can only be accurately assessed by
           looking at the local context and the logical sequence of results.

“Capacity development? is defined broadly by the CDRF as “a locally-driven process of learning
by leaders, coalitions, and other agents of change that brings about changes in sociopolitical,
policy-related, and organizational factors to enhance local ownership for and the effectiveness
and efficiency of efforts to achieve a development goal.?4 This extends beyond the more
traditional focus that is limited to training outcomes and instead covers the range of results
expected from the RAS portfolio.
According to the CDRF, analytic and advisory services are designed to address one or more of
three types of institutional capacity challenges:
          Low priority attached to the development goal by key stakeholders (strength of
           stakeholder ownership): Local leaders lack commitment to the development goal;
           relevant stakeholders do not participate adequately in decision-making; and/or
           widespread changes in attitudes or behaviors are needed.
          Deficiencies in the policy framework guiding pursuit of the development goal by different
           stakeholders (efficiency of policy instruments): Administrative rules, laws, regulations,
           standards, or other formal incentives are not efficiently guiding stakeholders’ actions to
           achieve a development goal.
          Weak performance of the organization(s) charged with achievement of the goal
           (effectiveness of organizational arrangements): The rules of action, processes, personnel,

        systems, or other resources within a specific organization are contributing to weak
        performance or formal organizational arrangements have not been established to serve a
        key function related to the development goal.

As shown in Figure 1, the CDRF provides a theory of change for assessing progres toward
institutional change objectives. Intermediate capacity and final (institutional capacity) outcome
indicators can be flexibly applied across sectors to assess the effectiveness and relevance of each
RAS. An intermediate capacity outcome is an improvement in the ability or disposition of agents
(key stakeholders) to take actions. Common examples among RAS outcomes include raised
awareness, enhanced knowledge or skills, improved consensus or teamwork, new or stronger
coalitions, enhanced networks, and new implementation know-how attained through “learning by
doing.?

While a RAS is unlikely to fully address identified institutional capacity challenges within its
limited timeframe, there should still be a program logic and evidence of intermediate outcomes
that signal how a RAS is (or is not) contributing to strengthening institutional capacity over the
longer term. The types of measurable characteristics that could be assessed within each area of
institutional capacity area are described in Annex 3.

The completion of four case studies in FY15 confirmed the potential value of a CDRF-based
approach for systematically assessing how the RAS program is helping to strengthen institutional
capacity in Romania.5 The CDRF provided a lens through which to interpret and track

incremental progress that the RAS program is helping to achieve toward the development goals
identified by the World Bank and the Government of Romania. However, the in-depth case study
approach was not practical for detailing a comprehensive set of results stories across all 39 RAS
agreements and the qualitative narratives did not easily support any aggregate assessment of the
overall portfolio performance.

For this evaluation, the method was adapted to apply a standard rating scale for marking the
progress achieved by each RAS in addressing identified capacity challenges blocking the
achievement of development objectives. Findings from the desk review of project documents,
survey of TTLs, and interviews with RAS stakeholders all helped to inform which capacity
challenges a RAS was designed to address and to provide evidence of incremental progress.
Ratings according to the six levels of progress—from “No outputs? to “Capacity change in
effect?—are presented in Box 1. More detailed definitions and examples of the types of evidence
needed for each level are in Annex 4 and the data collection protocols are in Annex 5.


      Box 1. Rating System for Assessing RAS Contribution to Institutional Capacity Change

 1. No outputs: Limited or no actions taken for addressing identified capacity challenge.
 2. Change initiated. Activities and/or products delivered to address capacity challenge but no
    evidence of outcomes is available.
 3. Knowledge gained. Early results of activities show changes in knowledge, skills, and/or
    relationships of relevant stakeholders.
 4. Knowledge used. Clear evidence shows new knowledge, skills and/or relationships are being
    applied as an intermediate step toward institutional capacity change.
 5. Capacity change emerging. One or more changes have emerged related to the targeted
    institutional capacity challenge, but these changes are not formal or their effects cannot be
    measured.
 6. Capacity change in effect. Evidence confirms that the targeted institutional capacity has been
    enhanced.



RAS engagements are implemented on a tight timeframe and are not generally be expected to
achieve institutional capacity changes as direct outcomes. Nonetheless, it is important to
understand the extent to which each RAS has contributed to intermediate outcomes and
incremental progress for building this capacity over the longer term.

Report Structure
The following sections explore the results of the World Bank’s RAS program in Romania and
provide a snapshot of their contributions for developing institutional capacity. As shown in

II.      Results for the Operational Program for Human Resources Development

Overview
The Operational Program for Human Resources Development (POSDRU) defined the priorities
and areas of intervention for implementing EU financial assistance through the European Social
Fund (ESF) for the programming period 2007 to 2013. ESF interventions in Romania were
designed to “assure investment in human capital, modernization of education and training
systems, increasing the access to employment and strengthening the social inclusion for
vulnerable groups.? 6

Seven of the RAS agreements included in this evaluation were paid for by the Government of
Romania using funds under the Managing Authority for POSDRU as listed in Table 2. Clients
included the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (MoESR) and the Ministry of Labor,
Family, Social Protection, and the Elderly (MoLFSPE).7

A key focus of the Bank’s RAS program under POSDRU was supporting the GoR in developing
national strategic policy frameworks to fulfill prerequisites for accessing ESIF funding for the
2014-2020 programming period. Five agreements helped to satisfy these ex-ante conditionalities
and made important contributions to increasing “the efficiency of policy instruments?—referring

to the CDRF-based assessment of how efficiently strategic frameworks or other formal
incentives guide stakeholders’ actions to achieve development objectives. RAS activities and
outputs also made modest contributions to strengthening stakeholder ownership and increasing
organizational effectiveness.

Ministry of Education and Scientific Research
The three RAS agreements paid for by the client using POSDRU funds in the education sector
focused on lifelong learning (LLL); reducing early school leaving (ESL); and increasing tertiary
education attainment, quality and efficiency. Each RAS focused in its own content area and
engaged the relevant stakeholder groups, but they shared similar objectives (supporting the
preparation of national strategic frameworks), overlapping implementation periods, and parallel
design elements. The components for each RAS included developing a draft strategic framework,
disseminating the framework, and strengthening the capacity to monitor LLL, ESL, or tertiary
education programs.

The RAS engagements achieved their objectives and the data compiled for this evaluation
provided a consistent picture of high quality contributions by the Bank team. As illustrated by
Box 2, in-depth interviews with 10 stakeholders across the education sector underscored the
value of the RAS outputs and the achievement of collaborative results. Particular strengths for
informing the strategic guidance that MoESR representatives highlighted included the RAS
teams’ detailed analysis of the “not always flattering? current context and conditions at the start,
the inclusion of best practice examples, and the convening and/or consultation of all relevant
stakeholders.

    Box 2. Example Perspectives on the Support for Strategies in the Education Sector
 “Romania has an important partnership with the World Bank in the education sector. There is a
 growing group of local experts working with the Bank team and we know the capacity and skills to
 expect. We can collaborate well together.?
  “The World Bank support for the strategies has been hugely important for writing the operational
 programs for the next funding period. We could not do this strategic approach ourselves and we
 really benefited from the combined efforts happening at the right moment. As we used to say in
 Romania, ‘you don’t have spring with one flower’.?
 “The analysis of the context and reasons for early school leaving and the resources needed is very
 thorough and useful for the ministry to substantiate future decisions related to education policies.?
 “I always found the World Bank team to be very open and flexible. The strategy required several
 reviews and changes and they provided the needed support during all the stages.?

Outcomes for each RAS extended beyond the changes in awareness, knowledge and skills of
individuals to reflect important progress toward strengthening institutional capacity for the
education sector. Data from the review of project documents, TTL survey, and stakeholder
interviews identified key institutional capacity challenges that each RAS was designed to
address. As described in Table 3, all three RAS engagements were very effective in improving

                                                   8
policy frameworks but the real evidence of these capacity changes will only be available once
the strategies are under implementation. Each RAS also made modest contributions toward
enhancing organizational effectiveness related to monitoring relevant programming financed
with EU funds.

In the summer of 2015, the GoR approved and adopted three national strategies for lifelong
learning; reducing early school leaving, and increasing tertiary education attainment, quality and
efficiency. Each national strategy was heavily based on the draft strategic framework and advice
provided through the respective RAS engagement. Stakeholders noted that the new strategies
were transparent and helped to clarify the roles and responsibilities across organizations.
According to the CDRF-based assessment applied for this evaluation, each strategy is expected
to guide stakeholder actions efficiently for achieving its development objective given the
strategy’s consistency with international standards and legitimacy with local stakeholders.
   Alignment with EU standards. The strategies satisfied the criteria for addressing ex-ante
    conditionalities related to ESIF financing during the 2014-2020 programming period.
   Legitimacy and inclusivity. The development of each strategy was based on an extensive
    consultative process with relevant stakeholders and review of data sources including the
    following:
       o Lifelong learning. Public consultation exercises engaged more than 530 stakeholders
         representing the GoR, education and training providers, employers, and social
         partners. These consultations included face-to-face group discussions is six of eight
         development regions of Romania and an online survey to further explore and confirm
         key findings. In addition, the RAS team compiled relevant existing data by
         consulting a range of non-governmental organizations and public agencies such as the
         National Institute of Statistics, the National Authority for Qualifications, the National
         Agency for Workforce Development, and many others for a total of 75 organizations.
       o Early school leaving. The comprehensive consultation process also engaged more
         than 500 individuals at the central, regional, and local levels. Key stakeholder groups
         engaged during the strategy formulation phase included government representatives,
         students, parents of students, employers, and social partners. Face-to-face discussions
         were organized in Bucharest, Brasov, Buzau, and Teleorman counties and a public
         online survey was conducted.
       o Tertiary education. The consultation process engaged representatives from the
         MoESR, academic staff, students’ unions, employers, as well as higher education
         agencies (160 individuals). An online survey was conducted and face-to-face
         roundtables were organized in four regions of Romania.
    In each case, input from the public consultation process helped to inform and prioritize the
    measures included in the strategies.

All three RAS engagements included components designed to build capacity for monitoring
LLL, ESL, or tertiary education programs. RAS activities and outputs provided guidance for
setting up monitoring arrangements and included the development of a monitoring information
system and training on its use for 70 to 80 staff in the Intermediary Body for Operational
Program for Human Resources Development (OIPOSDRU). Both OIPOSDRU and MoESR

                                                 9
stakeholders commented on the usefulness of the training for introducing “a monitoring culture?
but emphasized the need for more preparation and support before the new monitoring
arrangements and information systems could be implemented.

The World Bank collaborated with MoLFSPE to satisfy ex-ante conditionalities related to

on supporting Roma integration and reviewing the risk assessment and verification procedures

used for POSDRU. A focus group discussion with four MoLFSPE stakeholders supplemented
and corroborated the findings from the desk review of project documents and the TLL survey.

The RAS engagement to provide diagnostics and policy advice for supporting Roma integration
in Romania was designed to help MoLFSPE to develop national policies and identify cost-
effective programs in the key areas of poverty and social safety nets, employment, education,
housing and habitat upgrading, health, anti-discrimination, and institutional mechanisms for
effective local service delivery and the use of EU instruments. The assistance was designed to
support Romania in meeting the targets of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the ones of the
Romanian National Strategy for the Inclusion of the Romanian citizens belonging to Roma
minority 2012-2020;

As described in Table 4, the RAS was effective in contributing to more efficient policy
instruments. The diagnostics focused on gaps, challenges, good practices and lessons learned to
provide policy recommendations for supporting the social inclusion of Roma. The analysis
described in detail how legal provisions for addressing Roma needs were spread across a range
of policy instruments, including a total of 58 laws, decisions and ordinances that relate to local
service delivery, many of which cover multiple layers of government. This complicated the
development of a strategy that would be aligned with all these policy instruments. RAS outputs
were widely disseminated and discussed with policymakers involved in developing and revising
key national strategies and policies, including the National Roma Integration Strategy.

Some notable contributions of the diagnostic study related to housing. A key recommendation
was to make “informal settlement upgrading? eligible for funding under the new Regional
Operational Program. Another recommendation was to view “Roma housing? as one part of the
overall housing sector rather than a separate program, and to develop a National Housing
Strategy that is all-encompassing. This recommendation was implemented a year later when the
Bank was invited to help the government formulate a new National Housing Strategy under
Component 4 of the Harmonizing State and EU Funds RAS.

The diagnostic study presented new knowledge based on qualitative information collected from
field visits, focus groups, and interviews. The RAS involved four rounds of consultative
workshops to inform policymaking decisions and held a dissemination event with over 50
stakeholders form the government, civil society, and academia. This broad consultation informed
the policy recommendations delivered by the RAS team, but the extent to which stakeholder
participation helped to inform the national strategy and increase the commitment of leaders to be
supportive of the Roma social inclusion agenda was not clear.

Project documents highlighted the lack of coordination among the institutions tasked with
implementing the national strategy as a key capacity constraint. Specifically, there was limited
organizational effectiveness given the weak coordination between sector ministries and the
National Agency for Roma. The diagnostic study provided knowledge to support evidence-based
policymaking and for strengthening institutional arrangements. In addition, the RAS team
reported that the study helped to raise awareness of ministry and agency personnel regarding the
roles and responsibilities of their organizations related to Roma integration. The longer-term
effects of this awareness is not yet clear.

Managing authorities are responsible for managing and implementing operational programs in
accordance with the principles of sound financial management. While MAs can delegate key
tasks related to compliance and verification to Intermediate Bodies (IBs), they still have the
responsibility to ensure these duties were properly carried out. European Social Fund auditors
found deficiencies in the management and control systems for POSDRU funds during the 2007-
2013 programming period, and MoLFSPE sought World Bank assistance to address these
deficiencies.

In response to this request, a RAS agreement was designed to enhance the effectiveness of the
risk-assessment and verification procedures of the Operational Program for Human Resources
Development. The main components included the review and revision of the risk assessment
methodology and verification procedures, manuals for effective implementation by the MA and
IBs, and capacity building of the MA and IBs through training programs.

As summarized in Table 5, not all of the RAS activities and outputs were delivered as planned,
and no evidence was available to suggest that the manuals delivered by the RAS had contributed
to organizational effectiveness. The MA for POSDRU now has the manuals available and could
potentially adopt and use them in the future; however, the RAS team noted the following
shortcomings:
       Client feedback on the draft manuals was substantially delayed.



                                               12
        The RAS team lacked access to key people who could have facilitated piloting and walk-
         through tests.
        Due to the points above, the proposed revised procedures were not tested or piloted using
         actual or simulated data. The feasibility and appropriateness of the risk assessment and
         verification procedures proposed could not be confirmed.
        The three planned regional training programs were not delivered, given the delays noted
         above.

The advisory services agreement on the Romania strategy for the elderly and active aging was
designed to provide an analysis of the current situation, increase the technical capacity of the
GoR, and assist in preparing the Draft National Strategy for Active Aging and the Elderly for
2014-2020. A final key objective was to help the raise public awareness around the issue of
active aging and the elderly and build support for the Government's strategy. As presented in
Table 6, the RAS was effective in supporting the development of the new strategy but only
Change initiated in contributing to organizational capacity or changing widespread awareness

The strategic framework produced as a RAS output informed the new national strategy adopted
by the GoR in July 15, 2015. However, client stakeholders expressed dissatisfaction with the
RAS outputs, noting that the draft was missing key content and revisions were required by the
European Commission. For example, additional work was needed to add a detailed
implementation plan with indicators and financial sources. 8 Nonetheless, the final version did
satisfy ex-ante conditionality and has made a substantial contribution in terms of clarifying roles
and responsibilities across organizations.

  As described in the RAS progress report (November 1, 2014 - January 31, 2015), the Bank team arranged to
deliver the action plan later to accelerate the delivery of the framework at the request of MoLFSPE. However,
interviews with MoLFSPE stakeholders highlighted “a notable difference in quality? between the draft framework
for active aging and the one delivered for social inclusion and poverty reduction.

Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale: No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,

On the demand side, there has been weak stakeholder ownership related to active aging.
Responsible government agencies have tended to view issues related to the elderly in a simplistic
manner, limited to only a few aspects. Social participation levels are very low in Romania, with
volunteering by the older population being neither encouraged nor valued, and instances of elder
abuse being too frequent. As a starting point, the RAS established inter-ministerial working
groups and public consultation workshops for promoting increased commitment and cooperation
across agencies for addressing these issues. However, as noted by both the client and the Bank
team, widespread changes in attitudes will not happen through a one-year project, and new
initiatives and ongoing financial support will be needed to continue to keep raising awareness
over time.

While one objective of the RAS was to increase the technical capacity of the GoR, there is not
yet evidence that the MoLFSPE has the capacity needed to implement the strategy. During the
RAS, steering group meetings and consultative workshops informed the set-up of two new units
within the ministry for active aging advocacy and long-term care. At the time of this evaluation,
however, there was still only a small team within MoLFSPE dedicated to addressing issues
related to active aging and the elderly.

For the RAS designed to support the development of a Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty
Reduction, evidence collected from both the Bank team and the client indicated that capacity
constraints identified at the start included inefficient policy instruments and a lack of
organizational capacity. First, a coordinated approach was needed in the provision of policies,
programs, and interventions that are targeted to poor and vulnerable people and poor and
marginalized areas. A range of sector policies, programs, and interventions were already in

existence in Romania aimed at reducing poverty and social exclusion, but the key missing
ingredient was the coordination between these policies, programs, and interventions. Second,
there was weak administrative capacity, with specific shortcomings including the lack of an
integrated ICT system, the absence of evidence based policy decisions, and the need for the
modernization of the payments system.

RAS deliverables included a draft strategy for social inclusion and poverty reduction, a
background document with the diagnosis and analysis underpinning the strategy, an action plan,
and nine implementation plans for key policies (flagship initiatives) with high potential impact
for reducing poverty and social exclusion. After a series of consultations and revisions, the draft
strategy and action plan for 2015-2020 were adopted by the Government of Romania in May
2015. As noted in Box 4, client stakeholders were generally pleased with the work of the RAS
team, both for the quality of technical inputs and for the process of convening, coordinating, and
integrating a diversity of perspectives.

The RAS contributed to more efficient “policy instruments,? referring to formal mechanisms or
incentives that guide stakeholder actions across multiple ministries for achieving the longer-term
development objective. As summarized in Table 7, the new national strategy and action plan
addressed ex-ante conditionalities for attracting EU funds, and their implementation will be
closely monitored by the EC. These documents set the strategic directions for the next six years
in reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. In addition, five implementation plans offer
both a detailed implementation plan and an operational manual for key anti-poverty policies (for
activating poor beneficiaries which are out of the labor market; for the consolidation of means-
tested programs into a flagship anti-poverty program; for the development of integrated social
services; for addressing inequalities in disadvantaged schools; and for reforming the specialized
child care system).

Almost all of the diagnostic documents emphasized weak administrative capacity as a key risk
for the implementation of the measures adopted by the Government, and there was no evidence
available at the time of this evaluation that the RAS had contributed to building this capacity.
Four implementation plans offered a roadmap to gradually improve the administrative capacity
in areas where there are important deficits: policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation,
Management Information System (MIS) use and development, modernization of the payment
system, and targeting systems. Implementing these plans will be a key mitigation measure to
address this risk. The Government has now clear roadmaps on how to use their own resources,
as well as EU funds, to improve the quality of the staff and other policy and implementation
systems. It is too early to assess whether these resources will be used efficiently.

III.    Results for the Regional Operational Program

Overview
The Regional Operational Program (POR) is financed through the European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF) to support Romania’s sustainable and inclusive development. The
overall program objective for the 2007-2013 period focused on “supporting the economic, social,
territorially balanced, and sustainable development of Romanian regions, according to their
specific needs and resources, focusing on urban growth poles, improving the business
environment, and basic infrastructure.?9 As listed in Table 8, four of the RAS agreements
included in this evaluation were paid by using funds accessed by the clients through the
Managing Authority for the POR, in the Ministry for Regional Development and Public
Administration (MRDPA).

Available data sources provided extensive information about the activities, outputs, and results of
all four of the POR RAS agreements. Progress ratings for how much each RAS contributed to
changes in institutional capacity were based on the review of project documents, detailed input
via the TTL survey, and in-depth interviews with nine stakeholders based in Bucharest (MRDPA
and NGO think tank perspectives), Brasov, or Cluj-Napoca (local government and academia
perspectives).

Integration of Urban Marginalized Groups
Advisory services for the elaboration of integration strategies for poor areas and disadvantaged
communities focused specifically on identifying urban marginalized groups and including the
needs of these groups (including Roma settlements) into urban planning. Deliverables produced
under the RAS included an Integrated Intervention Tool for Urban Marginalized Communities,
an Atlas of Urban Marginalized Communities, and six pilot studies of different types of urban
areas.

As summarized in Table 9, the RAS was effective in improving the “efficiency of policy
instruments? in terms of how it contributed to formal incentives for guiding stakeholder actions
toward the achievement of the development objective. The outputs provided a detailed
implementation framework for the Community Led Local Development (CLLD) approach that
included a typology of urban marginalized communities and their characteristics, mechanisms to
identify the geographical location of different sub-types of the most marginalized urban
communities in Romania, and a proposed institutional arrangement with a detailed time frame.
As a result, the Regional Operational Program for the 2014-2020 programming period includes a
dedicated CLLD Priority Axis.

Evidence of the effectiveness of the CLLD axis for addressing marginalization will not be
available until projects are implemented. The only risk noted by stakeholders that could affect
the success of the new approach was that the CLLD mixes ERDF and ESF financing and thus
requires close institutional collaboration between MRDPA and the Ministry of Labor, Family,
Social Protection and the Elderly.

The RAS has effectively contributed to intermediate outcomes for increasing the organizational
effectiveness of the GoR, municipalities, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) over the
longer term. The Integrated Intervention Tool serves as a practical handbook for implementing
the CLLD and the six pilots simulated a CLLD process based on a diagnosis and needs
assessment for six types of urban marginalized communities. Together, the guidance and
detailed examples should help municipalities and NGOs to apply for funding to support
integrated interventions addressing urban marginalization.

Project Selection Models
The RAS for the identification of project selection models for the regional development, public
works, and tourism sectors produced recommendations to improve project selection models for
the 2014-2020 programming period for increased impact. The Bank team provided outputs
beyond what was stipulated in the Advisory Services Agreement, including detailed evaluation
and selection grids for the proposed ROP axes.

With the existing selection process, a major

Growth Poles
The World Bank also provided advisory services focused on the upgrade of growth poles for
strategic planning and economic impact. Deliverables under this RAS included a growth poles
policy report to guide the MA in improving the growth pole policy for the 2014-2020
programming period, a set of TRACE Energy Efficiency studies for Romania’s seven growth
poles, and an analysis of the integrated development plans for the seven growth poles.

The functional review of the 2008 growth poles policy highlighted several key shortcomings.
For example, it lacked a clear rationale for how designated growth poles can contribute to the
general development of Romania and it emphasized regional boundaries even though some urban
centers could capitalize on cross-regional synergies. A metropolitan area is defined to have a 30-
kilometer radius around a growth pole, but in practice workers are willing to commute up to one
hour each way on a daily basis. A larger metropolitan area could allow for a stronger economy
with a larger labor pool and better incentives for investments. In addition, the 2008 policy has
inconsistencies with other laws related to inter-communal cooperation.

At the time of the RAS completion, the Bank team expected that the RAS outcomes would
contribute to important improvements in the growth poles policy. However, the political
leadership within MRDPA considered the growth poles approach to be flawed and the
recommendations were not implemented. As reflected in Box 6, this resulted in some frustration
at the local level among municipal government stakeholders who viewed the analyses and
recommendations to be useful.

Overall, given the change in political leadership and the new approach adopted for the ROP
2014-2020, the Growth Poles RAS was a preliminary step for improving policy instruments over
the longer term. This case highlighted the real challenges RAS engagements encounter in trying
to achieve progress toward long-term development objectives within a changing political
context. Recommendations, even when informed by analyses and evidence, might require
demand-side changes in terms of increased commitment of the political leadership before they
could be implemented. Despite their expressed disappointment, the stakeholders interviewed
highlighted the importance of the RAS for achieving small incremental gains in terms of new

awareness and knowledge related to the potential roles and needs of growth poles for driving
Romania’s economic development.


                    Box 6. Reflections on Changes to the Growth Poles Policy
 “We worked with the Bank, thinking they had official support of the Ministry. Some growth poles,
 like us, started to develop a strategy for the next period based on the World Bank
 recommendations. Then the Ministry changed the approach and communication has not gone well.
 Most meetings are bilateral between the Bank and the ministry or the EC. We invested money and
 time and resources and now have to change gears.?
 “The Bank provided very important recommendations, but now the decision to give equal
 investment to all cities does not help very much. We have to think bigger for sustainable
 development. Transylvania is Cluj-centric, especially for hospitals and education. People come and
 they stay. There is a very high demand for affordable housing, for services, and for transportation.?
 “The Growth Pole Policy was not continued as envisaged. Still, all the studies and the analysis
 provided real support for us and helped to substantiate actions that we designed at the local level.?

Communication and Collaboration between MA and IBs
The Bank also completed a RAS designed to enhance the communication and collaboration
between the Managing Authority for the POR and the Intermediary Bodies (IBs) and to improve
the methods for providing support to beneficiaries. The main activities included an analysis of
how the relationship between the MA and the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) could be
improved, an assessment of beneficiary support instruments, and a knowledge exchange with
Spanish counterparts on MA-IB collaboration models to learn from the experiences of other EU
member states.

For the 2007-2013 programming period, the MA under MRDPA was responsible for the POR’s
design and implementation. The IBs, which consisted of eight regional development agencies
(RDAs) and one central IB for tourism, fulfilled tasks related to programming and
implementation as delegated by the MA. Beneficiaries included public, private, and non-profit
organizations that submitted financing applications and received POR funding for implementing

                                                        21
projects. Other key stakeholders included the Regional Development Council, and at the national
level, the Monitoring Committee of the POR, the Audit Authority, the Certification and Payment
Authority, and the Ministry of European Funds.

The institutional and legislative framework governing MA-IB collaboration had several points of
tension as a result of limited decentralization. The MA was overburdened with verifications,
approvals, and other procedures designed to validate operational decisions at the IB level. Also,
the day-to-day implementation tasks drained vital resources from the MA, distracting its staff
from more critical roles like vision-setting, communication with IBs and beneficiaries,
coordination among regional design and implementation, programming, and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E).

As summarized in Table 12, the RAS activities helped to improve the effectiveness of the POR’s
organizational arrangements. The RAS proposed a shift in paradigm, with beneficiaries of the
POR being put at the center of POR activities. A number of key recommendations have already
been adopted with the redesign of the POR 2014-2020. Some of these include changing the audit
trails to enable a faster processing of funding applications, strengthening the Project
Implementation Units at the level of beneficiaries, enabling direct financing of payment to the
contractors to avoid delays and to reduce the number of steps for the financing of works,
enabling design-and-build approaches to reduce the problems cause by poor technical designs,
and establishing less burdensome audit and monitoring procedures of beneficiaries.

Reflections
Interviews with MRDPA and local government stakeholders provided a positive account of
collaborating with the World Bank RAS teams. Without exception, any stakeholder who had
direct engagement with the RAS team found the TTL and/or team members to be responsive and
flexible. While there were some instances where the need for more local experts was noted, the
comments predominantly underscored the comparative advantage of the World Bank as a

Despite the positive assessment of the World Bank’s performance across all of the POR RAS
engagements for 2012-2015, there were recurring reflections among stakeholders about the
relative weakness of the Bank for providing technical guidance or helping to build
implementation capacity. As shown by the examples in Box 7, perceived strengths included
conducting in-depth diagnostics and elaborating strategies, but some frustration was expressed
that the Bank was not able to do more to ensure that the strategies could be implemented.


              Box 7. Perspectives on the Relative Strengths of the World Bank
  “We have really good communication with the Bank team. They are very responsive and try to
  put the right specialists at the right moment. It is a good collaboration.?
  “The World Bank is very good at strategies, policy development, policy elaboration, but they are
  not the right partner for the very technical documentation. We select them for the first level,
  elaboration of the framework, not for the technical design and details of the implementation.?
   “The World Bank has brilliant competence. Their analysis is very good…but in the part of giving
  strategic solutions they should improve a bit. It is not so well defined and clear how we can
  implement what they have produced.?
  “I would not say the Bank helps to build our capacity yet. There is a study, but how do we transfer
  the expertise from them to us? Maybe this is the problem with the current approach and the type
  of contract. The analysis they do is very sophisticated. Could they follow up and stay a bit near us
  to help process the data and make decisions? Perhaps there could be coaching to show us how to
  use the methods. That would be really building capacity.?

IV.       Results for the Technical Assistance Operational Program

Overview
The objective of the Operational Program for Technical Assistance (POAT) is “to ensure support
for the coordination and to contribute to sound, effective, efficient, and transparent
implementation and absorption of the Structural Instruments in Romania.?10 Specifically, the
program addresses needs identified for the whole system of management and implementation for
the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund, and Cohesion Fund. Other
sectoral operational programs benefit from the POAT for implementing operations, and the
POAT was designed to also give enhanced support for the coordination process and the financial
control and audit system.

As listed in Table 13, 11 of the RAS agreements included in this evaluation were under the
Managing Authority for the POAT, the Directorate for Technical Assistance within the Ministry
of Public Finance. The World Bank completed these for clients at the national, regional, and
county levels, including the Chancellery of the Prime Minister; Ministry of Regional
Development and Public Administration; Ministry of Environment, Water, and Forests; Ministry
of European Funds; Ministry of Public Finance; National Agency of Cadastre and Land
Registration; the Regional Development Agency of South Muntenia, and the Tulcea County
Council.

As in the other sections, the group of POAT RAS engagements was assessed in terms of how
each one contributed to addressing identified institutional capacity challenges such as weak
stakeholder ownership, inefficient (or missing) policy instruments, and limited effectiveness of
organizational arrangements. A standard desk review of project documents, survey of TTLs, and
interviews with selected clients informed the assessment of each RAS. The following
description of key outcomes is not intended to be an exhaustive list of RAS results but rather
focuses specifically on relevant, documented outcomes that are likely to contribute to and/or
support sustained institutional capacity changes over time.

Chancellery of the Prime Minister
Two of the RAS agreements paid for by the client under the Managing Authority for POAT were
conducted for the Chancellery of the Prime Minister (CPM) to strengthen the Center of
Government (CoG). These included the RAS providing support for the establishment of a
Delivery Unit (DU) and the one focused on strengthening the regulatory impact assessment
(RIA) framework in Romania. Data sources for these cases included the review of project
documents, additional inputs from the Bank team, and interviews with three client stakeholders
affiliated with the CPM and the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (NAFA). To rate the
effectiveness of the DU RAS for addressing identified institutional capacity challenges, the
evaluation also drew heavily on the sustainability review conducted by the RAS team and
delivered as the final output.11

The DU RAS aimed to achieve three objectives: to support the CoG in improving public sector
outcomes by mobilizing a new institution (the DU) to challenge and support line ministries, to
embed results-oriented practices within the line ministries, and to achieve selected policy
outcomes in four priority areas. The DU RAS was one of the largest RAS agreements completed
during the 2012-2015 period in terms of value ($6.04 million) and included 31 deliverables.

While the RAS did not achieve its central objective of establishing a Delivery Unit, the advisory
services contributed to incremental progress for enhancing institutional capacity in several areas,
as described in Table 14. Furthermore, while the CPM has not yet systematically embedded the
results-oriented practices within the CoG, the RAS contributed to important intermediate
outcomes in terms of raising the awareness of CPM staff and enhancing their knowledge of
approaches and tools, particularly related to establishing performance agreements, monitoring
progress against targets, reporting performance data, and using SMS mechanisms for citizen
feedback. Some of these practices are being integrated into ongoing programs, as reflected in


           Box 8. Use of Results-Oriented Practices from the Delivery Unit RAS
  “We started consulting taxpayers by means of text messages and this is how we were able to get
 information on what to improve. Taxpayers like giving this citizen feedback. We did have some
 ways to get feedback before but they were quite primitive—for example, formal questionnaires
 that people did not take seriously.?
 “With the citizen feedback and other models, now there are new programs that this government
 will put into practice. We are forming new working groups with four ministries for the anti-poverty
 effort, including labor, health, education, and regional development…the action plans follow the
 model of the Delivery Unit. We will sign agreements with the ministries involved that reflect
 priorities and milestones and then the reporting will also follow the same model.?

Box 8.


The DU RAS also achieved some important progress in the four priority areas even though the
results were not necessarily those planned for during the RAS design stage. RAS activities were
instrumental in facilitating the development of Romania’s new national strategy and action plan
for public procurement. They supported NAFA in launching the Private Virtual Space, an online
taxpayer platform, and in mobilizing the cooperation across agencies to create a registration
database for the young unemployed (Not in Education, Employment, or Training—NEET).
Institutions had failed to establish this cooperation on their own over the past ten years.

In the energy sector, the RAS team provided technical inputs for the national energy strategy, but
its drafting was delayed. However, other RAS activities were effective in improving the
transparency of State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and in strengthening mechanisms across
agencies for protecting consumer rights. Key performance indicators show important
improvements on the demand side as consumers have gained increased access to information and
opportunities for demanding accountability.

The RAS for strengthening the RIA framework in Romania was designed to create technical
capacity within the Romanian administration for using regulatory impact assessment, streamline
the RIA system, and raise awareness at the political level regarding the relevance and value of
RIA. Although the GoR has not implemented the recommended reforms, the RAS did make
notable contributions toward building institutional capacity, as summarized in Table 15.

First, the RAS was effective in starting the process of strengthening the RIA framework so that it
would be used consistently for evidence-based decision making. RAS activities included a
diagnostic exercise that was used to inform a series of recommendations. The RAS reports and
recommendations were published by the GoR to inform a debate. Second, the RAS contributed
to some intermediate outcomes for strengthening the technical capacity to conduct regulatory
impact assessments. Technical and legal staff and political leadership gained awareness of the
need for an improved RIA framework. The Department for the Coordination of Policies and
Programs (DCPP) of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister developed and started using a guide
based on the RIA methodology for the quality control of substantiation notes. Three RIA pilot
exercises were conducted to help government officials participating in working groups to prepare
RIA reports.

Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale: No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,
capacity change emerging, and capacity change in effect as defined in Annex 4.

Despite this progress toward enhancing institutional capacity in two areas (for more efficient
policy instruments and more effective organizational arrangements), the capacity change process
seems unlikely to continue without additional resources and interventions to establish the
consistent use of the RIA methodology. The recommendations in their current form have not
been accepted in the Romanian context, particularly given that the instructions to separate the
substantiation note from the normative act would require a legislative change. Also, leaders still
lack adequate commitment to systematically base decisions on evidence, despite their regular
requests for data, as illustrated by Box 9.

Neither of the RAS agreements financed under POAT to strengthen the Center of Government
achieved their objectives. However, with the current context of weak administrative capacity

RAS engagements paid for by the client under the POAT Managing Authority included four
completed by the World Bank for MRDPA. Assessments for how effective each engagement
was for contributing to local institutional capacity were based on data from the survey of TTLs,
desk review of project documents, and in-depth interviews with 11 non-Bank stakeholders from
MRDPA, local government, the private sector, and academia.12

The RAS for Competitive Enhancement Policies in the West Region was designed to develop an
in-depth competitiveness assessment of services and goods sectors in the West Region, and
identify policy measures and interventions to enhance the region’s growth potential.
Components included an assessment of trade competitiveness of the West Region’s economy in
a comparative perspective, case studies of selected sectors identified based on the findings of the
first activity, and identification of policy options and types of interventions to be supported
during the 2014-2020 programming period to improve the competitiveness of the West Region’s
economy.

Over the 2014-2020 period, the West Region has the opportunity to use its natural, human, and
financial resources to ensure consistent and sustainable development and achieve a gradual
convergence with Bucharest and the highly developed regions of Europe. This progress will
require that the region takes advantage of the available assets and financing and finds synergies
between the EU Funds and other financial sources in a strategic and integrated approach in order
to face the tremendous development challenges ahead and reach the strategic EU 2020 targets.
The project delivered analytical inputs which could be directly incorporated into a regional smart
specialization strategy.

Findings from this evaluation indicated that the RAS activities and outputs achieved intermediate
outcomes toward strengthening both the formal incentives that guide stakeholder behavior
(efficiency of policy instruments) and the organizational effectiveness of the Regional
Development Association of West Romania for designing support services to increase the export
competitiveness of the region. These changes are summarized in Table 16.

The Enhanced Spatial Planning RAS was designed to provide the GoR with actionable proposals
to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of territorial and spatial development policies and
investments. The two project components included an evaluation of the spatial planning system
and an evaluation of the urban development system in Romania. RAS activities produced five
reports that have been broadly disseminated, including Enhanced Spatial Planning as a
Precondition for Sustainable Urban Development, Competitive Cities: Reshaping the Economic
Geography of Romania; and three case studies for different territories (the Brăila County, the
Cluj Napoca Metropolitan Area, and the City of Alba Iulia).

As detailed in Table 17, the RAS helped to shift widespread development practices more towards
focusing on urban areas to drive economic growth, to inform the national territorial development
strategy and other key planning documents, and to improve the planning capacity and operational
efficiency of local governments. The benefits related to the administrative capacity of the
MRDPA appeared to be more limited, with no clear evidence that the reports and RAS activities
would directly support any long-term changes.

Even after its completion, evidence continues to emerge for how the Enhanced Spatial Planning
RAS is strengthening spatial and urban planning in Romania. The broad dissemination of the
spatial planning concepts and RAS reports are helping to engender a paradigm shift and to shape
strategic, programmatic and legislative documents at different levels. The reports have been
used in the Romanian Partnership Agreement for the 2014-2020 Programming Period (see Box
10), the National Territorial Development Strategy, the Regional Operational Program 2014-
2020, regional development plans and local and county development strategies. By the end of the

The RAS for the Danube Delta Integrated Sustainable Development Strategy was designed to
contribute to the planned and environmentally sensitive development of the Danube Delta region
and to support the GoR in applying a new EU funding mechanism called the Integrated
Territorial Investments (ITI) in the Danube Delta and Constanta metropolitan area. The scope
included also establishing a methodological framework for the efficient implementation of
sustainable urban development activities and producing a guide for promoting sustainable urban
development activities. These activities and outputs were intended to support the GoR in
developing a dedicated priority axis for sustainable urban development under the Regional
Operational Program 2014-2020. Changes were made to the RAS design during implementation
to accommodate this need.

During RAS implementation, the World Bank enlisted a team of over 100 experts to deliver 18
outputs. These experts represented a broad range of specialties such as fisheries, social
inclusion, administration, climate change, transport, regional development. As described in the
Activity Completion Summary, implementation was difficult for this project given the
complexity of the new ITI tool, the urgency to produce results, and the need to coordinate
communication and requests with the direct client (MRDPA) and one of the main future
beneficiaries (Tulcea County Council). Examples of the challenges for collaboration and the
RAS team’s efforts to respond to client concerns are in Box 11.

        Box 11. Reflections on Efforts to Improve Collaboration for Achieving RAS Results
    “The World Bank has very good experts. But the ones for the fishery, we never met them. This is not
    normal. We as the beneficiaries paid a lot of people and did not meet them. There was a big clashing
    debate about the fishery and we needed to validate the recommendations of the World Bank. But we
    could not arbitrate well because we were not even part of the discussion. For the next RAS, we will
    negotiate and communicate more to have a stronger joint collaboration.?

    “The flexibility of the World Bank is very important. At the start, the expert team was not appropriate
    for the activities, and things didn’t go well at the beginning. But they changed the project manager and
    the experts. They were open to revising the deliverables... we were quite pleased with the results.?

The Danube Delta RAS was designed to address key capacity challenges related to inefficient
policy instruments—that is, the strategies, policies, or other formal incentives that guide
stakeholder actions for achieving sustainable urban development. Notable challenges at the start
included:
     The framework regulation for urban planning in the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve
      (Government Decision no. 1516/2008) had not been fully implemented locally because some
      communes did not have the necessary resources to revise the general urban plans and the
      local regulations for urban planning accordingly.
     The institutional system for the administration of the Danube Delta is extremely complex,
      both vertically and horizontally, due to the special status of the area. Many of the institutions


                                                     34
    at different levels of government have had overlapping responsibilities with regard to
    environmental and biodiversity issues.
   Despite some decentralization measures, the central government remains vital for the
    administration of the Delta: five ministries have responsibilities in the area, but there is no
    central coordination mechanism for the Danube, and this cannot be compensated by the local
    cooperation between the various territorial structures.
   There have been several efficiency and legitimacy gaps between the organizations of the
    central government and those of the county / local government, the latter being forced to
    implement a number of central policies although they are often not involved in their drafting
    and they have an extremely low level of administrative capacity.

As summarized in Table 18, the RAS contributed to important progress in addressing these
constraints. Most notably, the Danube Delta Integrated Development Strategy (pending GoR
approval) provides the framework for how 1.1 billion Euro in EU funds will be spent between
2014 and 2023 in one of the most unique environmental areas in the World and one of the
poorest areas in Romania. The Sustainable Urban Development Guide provides the framework
for how 1.4 billion Euro in EU funds will be spent between 2014 and 2023 in the largest cities in
Romania to drive economic growth. In addition, the MRDPA now has a fully functional ITI
framework, which it should be able to implement independently in future programming periods.

Over the longer term, the innovative tools produced by the RAS can be expected to foster and
support more efficient planning and development by municipal governments. One valuable
contribution from the RAS is the specification of operational budgets for all beneficiary cities for
the 2014-2023 programming period. By providing an estimate of the funds beneficiaries could
allocate for capital investments, the budgets enable local authorities to identify integrated priority
project lists with multiple funding sources rather than just being limited to the EU funds
available through the POR.

The Danube Delta Integrated Sustainable Development Strategy was subjected to a longer-than-
expected review process, but there remained high-level commitment to finalizing and
implementing the strategy. On April 18, 2016, Prime Minister Dacian Cioloș participated in a
public debate organized by MRDPA, in collaboration with the Danube Delta ITI Intercommunity
Development Association and Tulcea County Council. Other high-level participants included
Deputy Prime Minister Vasile Dîncu, Minister of MRDPA, Aura Răducu, Minister of European
Funds, Dan Costescu, Transport Minister, and other representatives of central and local
administration responsible for implementing the strategy. The debate was expected to be a final
step in the consultation process, and the strategy received government approval in August
(Government Decision No. 602/2016).

The MRDPA also requested World Bank support for a RAS agreement focused on harmonizing
state and EU-funded projects in regions. Key aspects of this request included redesigning the
National Local Development Program (PNDL) and helping to elaborate a national housing
strategy to help coordinate and harmonize state-budget investments in the housing sector.

Romania’s Partnership Agreement, negotiated with the European Commission, outlines how 36
billion Euro worth of grants will be spent between 2014 and 2023. However, this funding will
only cover part of the infrastructure development needs in the country and significant sums are
also allocated from the state budget, county budgets, and local budgets in addition to private
investments and arrangements for public private partnerships. At the level of local authorities,
development strategies and plans are often geared toward specific funding opportunities, without
considering actual needs on the ground in an integrated manner (e.g., most cities produced
integrated urban development plans, which often were only geared towards attracting EU funds).
At the central level, as the World Bank 2010 and 2011 Functional Reviews showed,
communication and coordination across different ministries is deficient, leading to disjointed
interventions (e.g., paving the road, then digging to upgrade the water and sewage networks) and
failing to leverage potential synergies (e.g., financing back-to-back roads or “linking? two EU-
funded water projects with a state-budget-funded extension).

All public investment efforts have to be properly coordinated and harmonized. The PNDL is the
largest state-budget investment program and is largely focused on subnational investments that
are also covered under the EU-funded sectoral operational programs. At the start of the RAS, the
PNDL did not have any strategic document as its foundation nor did it have a clear
implementation timeline or clear criteria for prioritization and monitoring.


                                                        36
In addition, the GoR needed to define a comprehensive strategy for Romania’s social
infrastructure, particularly housing. While the housing law has been revised relatively frequently,
it lacks a rational framework as its basis. As described by the RAS team, “Romania’s housing
sector faces special policy, legal, financial, and institutional challenges? and “Romania’s housing
is among the most crowded, dilapidated, expensive, and poorly located of any country in
Europe.?13

RAS activities and outputs helped to address the identified institutional capacity challenges,
comprising one of the most ambitious efforts to reform public expenditure frameworks in
Romania after 1989. Notable results are presented in Table 19. Several of the recommendations
made by the Bank team (e.g. multi-annual implementation timeline, multi-annual budgeting)
have already been taken over by the Ministry of Regional Development in the re-design of the
PNDL. These are in line with best-practices in the design and operation of EU operational
programs.

Although the MRDPA leadership was initially reluctant to undertake the relatively bold
recommendations made by the Bank team, a political shift created more openness at the ministry.
Changes in knowledge, skills, and behaviors that are expected to support sustainable changes in
organizational capacity include the following examples:

      Investment Guides prepared by the team are now used not just by the PNDL team but have
       also been adopted by EU-funded operational programs. For example, the POR 2014-2020
       uses some of the prioritization criteria for the evaluation and selection grids for county roads.
       Similarly, they use the operational budgets proposed for each locality in Romania as a tool
       for the prioritization of investments for county capitals, under the Sustainable Urban
       Development Axis of the POR.
      The National Rural Development Program is using the Local Human Development Index
       developed by the RAS as a tool for their prioritization of investments at the rural level.
      The Large Infrastructure Operational Programme 2014-2020 is using the Investment Guide
       for Water and Wastewater for their investments in the sector.
      The Ministry of Transport wants to use the Investment Guide for County Roads as a
       blueprint for the prioritization of investments in the national road network.
      Several county councils (e.g. Brasov, Cluj, Calarasi) are already using the investment guides
       prepared during the RAS for developing multi-annual investment programs.
      The guides are also used by several metropolitan areas (e.g. Ploiești, Constanta, Craiova,
       Iasi) for identifying key investment needs in county roads, communal roads, water and
       wastewater, and social infrastructure.

Both the Client and the stakeholders involved have recognized the value of the work produced
by the Bank and have started to think about state-budget funded investment programs in a
different way. Organizations that stand to benefit from these outcomes in terms of improved
efficiency and effectiveness include MRDPA, the Ministry of Public Finance, Ministry of
European Funds, county councils, local administrations, metropolitan area intercommunal
development associations, the Romanian Association of Municipalities, the Romanian
Association of Communes, regional water companies, think tanks, and private consultancy
companies.

Ministry of Environment, Waters, and Forests
The Climate Change and Low Carbon Green Growth Program was the largest RAS in the World
Bank’s portfolio, with a value of $6.15 million. The advisory services agreement was signed
with the Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests (MEWF) in July 2013.14 The program
produced more than 30 reports, held over 30 events (workshops, review meetings, and
conferences), and developed an array of dissemination materials. The World Bank team
involved more than 50 international and local experts and four consulting firms covering 13
sectors.

The purposes of the RAS were to assist the GoR in updating and operationalizing Romania’s
national climate change strategies 2016-2030, developing the national action plan for 2016-2020,
identifying and integrating climate-related actions into EU-funded Operational Programs 2014-
2020, building an analytical base for impact assessments and climate-related decision making,
and enhancing climate-friendly practices and monitoring systems. This evaluation of the overall
RAS portfolio did not have the scope or timeframe to explore all of the potential outcomes of

this program. However, the desk review of project documents, input from the TTL, and
interviews with two Climate Change Directorate stakeholders helped to document how
effectively the RAS contributed to building institutional capacity in key areas.

As described in Table 20, the RAS contributed to key intermediate outcomes that could help to
facilitate needed institutional capacity changes over the longer term. Despite the period of
political transition and repeated turnover of MEWF personnel, RAS events and reports improved
the motivation and ability of some GoR officials in line ministries and agencies for focusing on
the climate change agenda. With the improved awareness and access to information, Romanian
policymakers are now in a better position to articulate and argue for integrating climate change
concerns into cross-sectoral public policies at the local, national and international level.

The Climate Change RAS helped to develop new awareness, knowledge, skills, and resources
that could increase the capacity of relevant agencies and ministries to plan, implement, and
monitor climate change actions. The program conducted a set of rapid sectoral analyses in key
sectors. The GoR was able to draw on RAS activities and outputs to integrate needed climate
actions by sector into the 2014-2020 operational programs for EU funds. The RAS also worked
with a range of institutions to develop an analytical base for making informed decisions,
including the operationalization of the climate change strategies for 2016-2030, development of
the 2016-2020 action plan for climate change, and identification of carbon financing
opportunities. As illustrated by the stakeholder perspectives shared in Box 10, the RAS reports
and events played an important role in highlighting the importance of climate change actions—
particularly for the key sectors of water, agriculture and rural development, forestry, energy,
transport, and urban development—and motivating management and staff to engage more in the
activities and decision-making.

Overall, clear challenges remain for planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating
coordinated multi-sectoral climate change actions. After a lengthy review process, the national
strategy and action plan were approved and published by the GoR in late September 2016. There
is still not a proven platform for cross-sectoral coordination, and the policies and measures for
mitigation and adaptation proposed as RAS outputs require an integrated approach to ensure
effective and efficient implementation, since measures within one sector potentially influence
others. The implementation capacity of relevant ministries and agencies, including MEWF,
remains a concern, with a continued need to increase staffing and enhance staff skills.

Ministry of European Funds
Two of the Bank’s RAS engagements under the Managing Authority for POAT were completed
in sequence for the Ministry of European Funds (MoEF). The first was to provide technical
assistance for improving the national framework for preparing and implementing public
investments projects and the second was to help establish a performance appraisal system for
GoR officials managing EU funds.

At the start of the first RAS on the national framework for public investments, Romania was
programmed to receive substantial funding from the European structural and cohesion funds.
However, Romania’s absorption of EU funds was the lowest among EU 10 countries, with
constraints across the entire project cycle. The Authority for the Coordination of Structural
Instruments (ACIS) therefore requested support from the World Bank to identify concrete
proposals for streamlining core procedures related to the public investment cycle. In response to
this request, the objective of the RAS was to provide the GoR with actionable proposals for
rationalizing the bureaucratic procedures that negatively impact the timeliness and quality of
public investments and enhancing the administrative processes and guidance to improve the
quality of public investment outcomes.

As described in Table 21, the RAS was designed to address challenges related to the current
regulatory framework and initiated the change process toward more efficient policy instruments.
One design flaw was that the primary client lacked authority for addressing many of the problem
areas. Also, existing cabinet and CoG processes were too weak to address topics requiring heavy
inter-sectoral coordination. One assumption had been that the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit,
having been established to help strengthen the CoG, would play an essential role in achieving the
RAS objective. However, the recommendations of this RAS were not adopted into the DU
agenda, and the DU has not yet proven to be effective over the longer term.

The MoEF is better informed regarding the issues that affect the Public Investment Management
Framework. The three-volume final report delivered by the RAS included matrices with
recommendations, potential timing, impact, and institutional responsibilities that were expected
to inform the Ministry’s action plan. The client also requested two follow-up RAS engagements
to develop a performance appraisal system for government officials managing EU funds and for
strengthening public investment management.

Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale: No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,
capacity change emerging, and capacity change in effect as defined in Annex 4.

To strengthen absorption and improve the effectiveness of officials managing EU funds, the GoR
and the EC agreed upon a Priority Action Plan for strengthening government effectiveness which
included the introduction of a performance appraisal system. The Romanian public
administration has had elements of a performance management system at the national and
regional levels, but a unified central system for all entities managing EU funds was needed for
the new programming period.

As a follow-up to the RAS for strengthening the public investment framework, the World Bank
provided advisory services to the MoEF to strengthen the performance management system for
GoR officials involved in the management of EU Structural and Cohesion funds. The RAS was
designed to analyze the revised institutional structure of managing authorities for the new
programming period with a focus on streamlining workflow and job functions for improving
performance, conduct a job analysis, and develop concrete qualitative and quantitative indicators
for the performance management of the identified job functions. The MoEF envisioned that the
new performance management system would act as an incentive for civil servants responsible for
managing EU funds by setting and regularly measuring goals for managing individual
performance and providing periodic opportunities to test and objectively evaluating staff
competence.

As described in Table 22, the MoEF is implementing the new performance appraisal system
developed as a result of this RAS to assess the impact on the performance of approximately
1,000 civil servants involved in managing EU funds. However, it is too soon to assess whether
this new system has contributed to enhanced institutional capacity over the longer term related to
improved effectiveness of organizational arrangements. Example perspectives on the need for
more time and effort to sustain longer-term changes is in Box 11.

interesting example how the World Bank and GoR can effectively work together. The RAS was
planned to start following revisions to the institutional structure for managing EU funds under
the 2014-2020 programming period. The overall timeframe was therefore very tight for
delivering outputs on the timeline set by the European Commission. In addition, the GoR and

Ministry of Public Finance
Romania’s efforts to transfer investments from the state budget to EU funds have been
challenged by inefficiencies in the preparation and management of public investments. In this
context, the World Bank received a request from the MoPF to improve the effectiveness of
public investment management, rationalizing the existing project portfolio, and strengthening the
link between prioritized projects and resources from EU funds and the state budget.

The PIM RAS reflected an ambitious effort by the World Bank to deliver 14 analytical reports
within 15 months. Project activities focused primarily on diagnostic and analytical activities in
order to develop a more effective and efficient PIM system. Therefore, the main targeted
institutional capacity change targeted by the RAS was to increase the effectiveness of
organizational arrangements as described in Table 23. In fact, the RAS outputs potentially
inform improvements for a broad range of organizational functions within the MoPF—
particularly for the Public Investment Evaluation Unit (PIEU)—but these are grouped together
under one summary rating in terms of the available evidence for whether RAS activities have
resulted in measurable changes in organizational capacity and performance related to public
investment management.15

Overall, the review of project documents indicated that RAS activities initiated the change
process for contributing to the improved effectiveness of the PIM system. The diagnostic
exercises provided valuable information about the existing strengths and weaknesses of the
organizational structure, technical expertise and staff capacity, information systems, and other
aspects which informed detailed recommendations for a proposed strategy and action plan
presented in the final report. However, it is not yet clear how or whether this information will be
used by the client. In the RAS Activity Completion Summary, the team noted that “it is highly
likely that further technical assistance would be needed in order to guide the GoR on the
implementation of the suggested reforms.?

To a lesser degree, the RAS was also expected to help build leadership commitment to the PIM
reform. However, the RAS team encountered unexpected challenges during implementation and
there was no evidence that the activities increased stakeholder ownership of the PIM reform.
The PIM RAS was originally strongly supported by the Minister of Budget – a position which
has since been abolished. Since then, the ownership and interest in PIM reforms has decreased
and there was no high-level administrative or political figure who could act as champion and
convene and unite PIM-stakeholders behind the necessary reforms to facilitate their
implementation. Also, the legal agreement was based on the assumption that MoPF and pilot
ministry officials would play a much more active role in the project implementation, while the
Bank experts would play more of a facilitative role. In reality, the participation of government
officials was rather limited.




15
  No client interviews were conducted to explore the results of the PIM RAS, so the overall assessment is based on
the review of project documents and does not reflect any progress achieved after the final report (November 2015).

stall the reform process.
Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale: No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,
capacity change emerging, and capacity change in effect as defined in Annex 4.

In reporting lessons, the RAS team noted that defining a RAS based on legal or political
requirements for actions to be taken by the client may provide for a clearer mandate and more
active client participation. While all elements of the PIM RAS were crucial to achieve reform
outcomes, only few of them were based on existing and clear legal or political requirements. For
example, there was no requirement to rationalize the portfolio or improve the quality control
despite the importance of such reforms to solve the overarching PIM-challenges. For the time
being, such reforms hinge on the political willingness to go ahead and create the necessary legal
framework.

RAS activities early on identified problems in the current legal and regulatory framework, such
as changes needed to strengthen MoPF’s quality assurance and independent review functions, for
supporting portfolio rationalization, and introducing multi-annual commitment appropriations for
public investment projects. However, the RAS was not designed to change laws or policies (i.e.
to achieve progress related to the “efficiency of policy instruments?) but rather to enhance the
capacity of the MoPF by providing guidance and recommendations to do this in the future.
Therefore, no progress ratings are assigned for this type of institutional capacity change.

National Agency for Cadastre and Land Registration
The World Bank provided technical assistance to the National Agency for Cadastre and Land
Registration (ANCPI) to strengthen the agency’s capacity to improve its policy, regulatory and
institutional framework. RAS activities and outputs reflected an ambitious effort to inform the
development of a strategy for land registration in Romania, revise ANCPI’s legal and
institutional framework, and develop a national program for improving the coverage, efficiency,
service delivery, and responsiveness of real estate registration in Romania.

While no client counterparts for this RAS were interviewed as part of this evaluation, the project
documents provided detailed information about existing constraints and RAS results. This

information was used to assess the extent to which RAS activities and outputs effectively
contributed to longer-term institutional capacity changes, as described in Table 24.

Some progress was achieved for two types of institutional capacity. First, the draft National
Strategy for Systematic and Sporadic First Registration and the draft legislation for the
Integrated Cadastre and Land Book System both reflect improvements related to the “efficiency
of policy instruments? given their potential to formally guide diverse stakeholder actions to
contribute to the development objective. Second, preliminary outcomes produced by the RAS
could help to strengthen the “effectiveness of organizational arrangements? for both ANCPI and
for the National Program for Cadastre and Land Book (NPCLB).

The ongoing political and institutional stability of ANCPI presented substantial challenges
during RAS implementation. ANCPI has had frequent transitions, with 12 Directors General
over 17 years. One major institutional change during the RAS was the transfer of ANCPI from
the General Secretariat of the Government to the MRDPA. Also, while the fees ANCPI’s
services generate could fund, as in many other countries, a program to establish a comprehensive
cadaster and land registration system, the agency instead has been a source of profits for the
central government. In February 2014, the GoR approved an emergency ordinance establishing

                                                          46
the agency as a partially fee-financed agency, which completely changed the agency and created
new legal requirements for ANCPI to respond to in a tight timeframe to prepare the NPCLB.

Sustained efforts will be needed to complete the policy, regulatory and institutional reform
processes that were started under this RAS. ANCPI has therefore requested follow-up support
from the World Bank under a new RAS. The objective of this technical assistance is to support
ANCPI in implementing its investment programs and legal and institutional reforms, and in
developing new electronic services using the improved digital records as the base.

Regional Development Agency South Muntenia
The Regional Operational Program for 2007-2013, discussed previously, included an analysis of
the Integrated Development Plans prepared for the growth poles and ways that these could be
improved. The Office of the Growth Pole Coordinator in Ploiești and the Regional Development
Agency South Muntenia reviewed this RAS work and requested that the World Bank help to
implement recommendations through a new RAS Agreement focused on the Ploiești Growth
Pole. This metropolitan area includes the city of Ploiești and 13 neighboring localities.

The main activities of the RAS included helping the Ploiești Growth Pole Coordinators Office
to update the Ploiești Integrated Development Plan (IDP) for the 2014-2020 Programming Period
and to offer recommendations for an improved institutional framework for the implementation of
the 2014-2020 IDP. Building on the methodology the World Bank prepared for the MRDPA, the
team proposed an integrated package of priority projects for the Ploiești Growth Pole, the first
time this was done in Romania. All the major cities in Romania will have to prepare similar
priority project lists, and the Ploiești Strategy is expected to serve as an example for them.

As described in Table 25, the RAS helped to shape formal incentives to guide stakeholder
actions across organizations through the design of an Integrated Urban Development Strategy
(IUDS) and a proposed institutional framework. The IUDS also serves as an important resource
and model for other cities and will potentially enhance their planning capacity for developing
their own strategies.

The RAS team managed to bring several stakeholders together (the Ploiești City Hall, the
Prahova County Council, the Prahova Prefect, the local authorities that are part of the Growth
Pole, public companies, the local university, the private sector, and the citizens) around the
shared goal of determining the key projects for the Ploiești Growth Pole through 2023. The scope
of the development strategy was then adjusted from a list of around 600 projects to a priority list
of 22, given the implementation capacity of the local authorities.

RAS outputs included recommendations for a new institutional framework that highlighted
various concerns with the current system. However, it is not yet clear to what extent these
recommendations will be implemented. Also, the local authorities in Ploiești faced a number of
challenges during the implementation of the project (e.g. the mayor was arrested and
subsequently the acting mayor was ousted by the Local Council). As such, much of the dialogue
with one of the most important clients of this work was done at a technical level and increased
leadership commitment is still needed.

Tulcea County Council
The focus of the World Bank’s RAS collaboration with the Tulcea County Council was to
provide support for the institutional capacity development of the Danube Delta Inter-communal
Development Association (ADI) to coordinate the Integrated Territorial Investments (ITI)
instrument. The ITI is a new EC instrument intended to draw on resources from different EC-
funded operational programs to finance priority investments based on a development strategy. In
this case, the ITI is intended to be the main funding mechanism for implementing the Danube
Delta Integrated Sustainable Development Strategy.

RAS activities were designed to support the development of the human, procedural and logistic
resources needed to support the preparation and implementation of the ITI. Specific outputs
included a capacity building report, operational manual, and organizational report. The team
also provided training with the aim of enhancing capacity related to communication and
visibility, financial management, procurement, project selection, monitoring and evaluation, and
general management.

As summarized in Table 26, the RAS contributed to intermediate outcomes for building the
organizational capacity of the ADI. While the planned knowledge products and initial training
were delivered, there remain substantial challenges for implementing the ITI. These include:
       Frequent changes in ADI management during the last couple of months of the RAS
        implementation period. Leadership commitment to using the RAS outputs under these
        conditions has been unclear.
       A need to address organizational structure and protocol issues. An analysis of the
        Articles of Association of ADI ITI DD highlighted key issues and presented
        recommendations. These mainly concerned protocol issues that are important from a
        legal and administrative point of view. Also, the current structure has some overlapping
        responsibilities such as between the Beneficiary Liaison Department and the MA Liaison

        Department. Recommendations to clarify roles and responsibilities were made, but these
        require commitment and actions by the client organization to implement.
       A risk of turnover among trained ADI staff. Continued support and commitment is
        needed to retain the training participants and facilitate their application of new knowledge
        and skills.

Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale: No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,

Despite the risks, the RAS outputs do have the potential to continue supporting institutional
capacity changes related to the use of the EC’s new integrated financing instrument. The manual
and reports provide recommendations for developing new organizational capacity, systems, and
processes. These could form a strong foundation for the future operations of ADI-ITI Danube
Delta if there is renewed commitment to implementing them.

Overview
The Operational Program for Administrative Capacity Development (PODCA) focuses on
creating and strengthening the legislative and institutional framework necessary for improving
service delivery to support the longer-term aims of economic growth, improved social
conditions, and good governance. The priority axes of PODCA for 2007-2014 were designed to
address horizontal management problems at all public administrative levels (central and local)
and target improvements to the decentralization of service delivery in prioritized sectors (health,
education, and social assistance). Targeted beneficiaries therefore include the central
administration (ministries and their subordinated agencies) and the local administration (county
authorities, municipalities, and communes.16

The World Bank completed 14 RAS agreements that were financed by the client under the
Managing Authority for PODCA, as listed in Table 27. The clients for these engagements
included the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the Ministry of
Education and Scientific Research, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the Ministry of Public Finance
(MoPF), the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI), and the Romanian Competition
Council (RCC). One RAS was also completed directly for the MA within MRDPA.

Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
The modernization of the Romanian economy and progress toward higher living standards over
the past two decades have largely bypassed the rural economy. Transforming agriculture is
therefore central to Romania’s European integration and social cohesion objectives.

In 2012, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development embarked on a far-reaching reform
agenda that covered both policy and public administration. The program consisted of four
interrelated RAS agreements signed with the World Bank intended to strengthen agri-food sector
strategy formulation, develop strategic planning capacity within the agricultural and rural
administration, implement an internal management and control system, and develop an
integrated financial management system in the sector administration.

The RAS for supporting the agri-food sector strategy formulation was designed to address
inefficiencies in the current strategic and operational management of public policy cycles by
MARD. For example, public policies in agriculture and rural development were driven mainly
by a sectoral perspective (e.g. cereals, milk, fruits and vegetables). Gaps in horizontal issues –
such as land and structural reform, taxation in agriculture, value chain and market integration,

                                                  51
and professionalization of farmers – were systematically overlooked. Key RAS components
included developing a medium/long-term vision for the ARD sector, producing policy papers
and technical notes to improve the effectiveness of policies, and proposing a new integrated
solutions architecture to improve data management for decision-making.

As summarized in Table 28, the RAS was effective in supporting the development of a
transparent sector-wide strategy that reflects broad stakeholder input and is consistent with
related policy documents. The strategy coherently integrates EU and non-EU programs and
services, has received the needed clearances from ministries in the field, and is now available on
the MARD website.

Implementation of the strategy will require sustained effort that starts with comprehensive
institutional reform for the agricultural administration to modernize and digitize its systems and
procedures, strengthen its human capacity to better meet current and future business needs, and
effectively manage the risks faced by farmers. Therefore, RAS activities also developed a
prototype for the ARD sector information database and a proposed integrated solutions
architecture to support strategic analysis and reporting.

Feedback from the project team and from the client indicated that the ARD Sector Information
Database Prototype focused on the livestock sector generated important new knowledge and
skills about how to process, analyze, and report on data to form better management and decision-
making. However, RAS outputs did not include a fully-functioning database and resource
constraints inhibited further design and implementation progress within MARD. In a new
collaboration between MARD and the Institute of Statistics to establish a similar database, it is
not year clear to what extent the prototype and lessons learned from the World Bank RAS will
inform the new design.

The second RAS in the reform agenda for the MARD was focused on increasing the capacity for
strategic planning within the agricultural administration. The main activities included supporting

                                                         52
the drafting of an institutional strategic management plan, analyzing and providing proposals for
the restructuring of the agricultural administration, training for staff to increase awareness and
knowledge related to institutional strategic planning, and developing an ICT prototype for
strategic planning and performance assessment to serve as a feedback loop for policy
formulation.

As part of the larger reform program, the second RAS faced some inherent challenges given that
the development of an institutional strategic plan would normally follow the development and
adoption of a sector strategy. The sequencing of activities should be to start with the sector
strategy to determine what actions and resources are needed at the institutional level to achieve
the medium and short term objectives and to monitor implementation. Despite the fact that the
sector strategy has only recently been formally disseminated by the MARD, the Strategic
Planning RAS was effective in enhancing the organizational capacity of the agricultural
administration for strategic planning, as summarized in Table 29.

The Strategic Planning RAS placed significant emphasis on involving client ministry staff
closely and directly in the development and testing of the new strategic planning tools. Also, the
RAS made ongoing efforts to train client ministry staff in the use of the new tools, as well as to
share good international practice. Surveys and interviews conducted at RAS completion
indicated notable improvements in the knowledge and awareness of the client ministry
management and staff. Comments from the client—as shared in Box 12—highlighted the value
added by the RAS team not only for MARD but also potentially for other ministries throughout
the GoR working to strengthen their strategic planning functions.

The third RAS implemented by the World Bank as part of the MARD reform agenda was
focused on the implementation of an internal management system for the client ministry and its
subordinated structures. RAS activities included reviewing the implementation status of the
internal management and control system (IMCS) for MARD and the Agriculture Payments and
Intervention Agency (APIA), Paying Agency for Rural Development and Fisheries (APDRP),
National Agency for Livestock Amelioration and Breeding, National Agency for Fisheries and
Aquaculture, State Domain Agency, and four County Agricultural Directorates selected to ensure
regional representation. Other RAS components included developing modern management tools
necessary to ensure efficient internal management/control systems and support for operating
them, strengthening the human resource capacities of the MARD to develop the internal
management/control system through dedicated training, and assessing progress for the
implementation of the management tools.

The diagnostic review conducted at the start highlighted important shortcomings of the existing
system to inform improvements, including:
   Self-assessment reports, as stipulated in MoPF Order 946/2005, are not sufficient to assess
    the real level of IMCS implementation. The reports are based on personal declarations of the
    senior managers of each institution and are subject to interpretation and subjectivity.
   The assessment of MARD, APIA, and APDRP revealed that IMCS implementation is mainly
    driven by the obligation to strictly comply with the legal provisions in place, without a real
    impact on the efficiency, effectiveness, and financial side of the operations. Nearly all of the
    institutions have instituted ad hoc internal working groups and internal structures for IMCS
    implementation.
   There is a strong need for hands-on training for the IMCS coordinators. All staff in general
    and new staff in particular need to be included in an institutional awareness program on the
    rules of IMCS.

                                                54
As described in Table 30, the RAS was effective in strengthening the IMCS for MARD and
selected subordinated institutions. The RAS assisted the client in developing a new framework of
policies and procedures while streamlining and aligning the standards and controls to the internal
legal requirements and international practice. These changes were supported by a proposed IT
platform with specifications for a document management system and dashboard reporting for
MARD. The system was also designed to assist new staff members become effective in their
roles and have a clear understanding of how the institution operates soon after their recruitment.

Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale: No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,

The wide participation of staff in meetings with the RAS team and their active contribution to the
RAS activities enhanced their exposure to international practice. They gained knowledge through
participating in the process and through training on the implementation of the new system
(IMCS) and should be prepared to contribute to system development.

Despite the intermediate outcomes achieved by the RAS, there remain some key risks for
sustaining the institutional capacity change process for increasing operational efficiency at the
MARD and its subordinated agencies. Although the client has produced and distributed a manual
outlining standards for the IMCS, the MARD has been challenged to formulate data sheets for
the standards and did not receive the expected support from the RAS team for this process. In
addition, the lack of resources to support the development and implementation of the proposed
approaches has delayed the implementation of the action plans, including the staff training plan.
Increased leadership commitment to the principles and components of the IMCS is needed to
reduce the risks and promote implementation.

The fourth RAS implemented by the World Bank as part of the reform agenda for the MARD
focused on the development of an integrated financial management system (IFMS). RAS
activities included evaluating the performance of the existing financial management system of
the MARD and its subordinate agencies, identifying how the systems could be integrated,
proposing solutions through the adoption of modern financial management tools, and providing
the basic functional specifications for the IFMS.

RAS activities initiated the change process for contributing to improved financial management
for the MARD, as detailed in Table 31. RAS outputs were designed to address identified
weaknesses, including the lack of coordination and integration across financial management
functions and across subordinated units and agencies at MARD and the need for automation to

standardize manual-intensive processes or ad hoc solutions. However, MARD has yet to start
implementing the IFMS, with the first release limited to Accounting, Payroll and Human
Resource Management. As such, other IFMS core components such as Budget Management,
Cash Management, Procurement and Asset Management and Integrated Reporting are not being
implemented. Further, additional plans for implementation remain unclear.

Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale: No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,

The lack of financial resources to fully implement the system designed under this RAS has
limited the effectiveness of the RAS for contributing to a sustainable institutional capacity
change. A partial implementation of IFMS will not provide MARD with comprehensive,
reliable and timeline financial information for planning, management and reporting. Also, the IT
landscape will not be simplified through a piecemeal implementation of the IFMS, and financial
accounting and management will continue to be challenged with multiple sources of information
and inefficient, manual processes to transfer data from one system to another.

Ministry of Education and Scientific Research
As a result of the Functional Review conducted by the World Bank in 2010 and 2011 for the pre-
university sector in Romania, the MoESR requested assistance in enhancing its administrative
capacity and in developing the management and leadership skills of its managers and staff.
Activities for the RAS to assist the MoESR in developing its administrative capacity focused
mainly on reorganizing the MoESR and helping to improve its organizational culture and
management practices. Information on the RAS results was collected through the TTL survey,
in-depth interviews with six client stakeholders, and a review of project documents.

As described in Table 32, the RAS provided integral support for strengthening the effectiveness
of the Ministry. An innovative approach was used by the RAS team for analyzing organizational
culture, management and organizational structure issues, some of which reflected very sensitive
areas. Management and staff participated in extensive debates around the desired organizational
culture and helped to design action plans on how to achieve needed changes. The team reported
active engagement of key stakeholders throughout the process, with 85 percent of all Ministry
staff participating in surveys and key outputs disseminated and debated in all 42 county school
inspectorates in Romania.

RAS activities demonstrated the possibility of a much more efficient allocation of resources and
responsibilities within the MoESR and across the pre-university schooling system. A pilot on the
delegation of authority showed promising results for freeing management up from time-
consuming administrative tasks. Similarly, new internal functioning regulations and job
descriptions were promoted as management tools aimed at clarifying the roles and relevance of
different directorates for the mission and vision of the Ministry. MoESR stakeholders
recognized both the value and the ambitious scope of the change processes that had been started,
as shown by the examples in Box 13.

Given ongoing political transitions, the longer-term results of this RAS engagement remain
unclear. However, inputs from the Bank team and the MoESR stakeholders reflected a
determination to continue implementation of the planned changes in the organizational structure
and culture for a more effective and efficient pre-university schooling system.

 concrete issues based on functionality. I have been here for 15 years now and this is the first time
 we had this kind of change.?
 “The delegation project should be rolled out in the ministry because it allows you to unblock the
 managers. Managers should focus on preparing policies, not so much solving administrative issues.
 The General Directorate with the highest number of petitions has 5,000 per year. A huge part of the
 time goes to this activity. So the delegation should continue but it is up to the DG and needs
 approval of the management of the ministry. I don’t know of any plans to continue it.?

 example, the consultant went to the high school to see who there is responsible for learning
 outcomes? No one!?

Ministry of Justice
After Romania’s accession to the EU in January 2007, a Cooperation and Verification
Mechanism (CVM) was established to help Romania address shortcomings in areas related to
judicial reform and corruption and to monitor changes in these areas through annual progress
reports. Starting with the 2010 Progress Report, the EC recommended that Romania launch an
independent performance review of its judicial system to inform needed improvements. The
Ministry of Justice therefore requested assistance from the World Bank to assess performance of
the judicial system.

The main objective of the RAS for the MoJ was to analyze the functioning of institutions of the
judicial system in Romania and to provide analytical and advisory input to enable the Romanian
authorities to formulate an action program for improving its performance. The longer-term aim
was that the recommendations could lead to the end of the CVM and to Schengen accession. Key
RAS activities included:
     Assessment of the organizational structure and functioning of the judicial system;
     Analysis of the use of human and financial resources allocated to the judicial system;
     Assessment of the functionality of the ICT environment and architecture of the judicial
         system; and
     Provision of a systematic framework to identify and mitigate risks affecting the
         performance of the judicial system.
In addition, the RAS team organized workshops with relevant institutions individually and
jointly to discuss findings and build consensus on the recommendations.

As described in Table 33, the RAS provided the basis for an action plan, an important
intermediate outcome for strengthening the performance of the judicial system. The detailed
analysis and subsequent recommendations addressed challenges related to the overall use of the
system’s resources, quality in terms of the uniform application of the law, efficiency in dealing

                                                   58
with priority cases, and access to justice. The data and analysis have informed the GoR’s policy
dialogue with the EC on justice in general and on the CVM in particular.

Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale:No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,

Political volatility and transitions were acknowledged by the RAS team to be the greatest risk for
building on the RAS results. At RAS completion, the MoJ started the process for developing an
action plan based on the recommendations.

Ministry of Public Finance
Four of the World Bank’s RAS engagements under PODCA were conducted for the Ministry of
Public Finance. Stakeholder interviews were not conducted in 2016 for this set of projects, so
findings are based on the review of project documents, inputs from TTLs, and the pilot case
study conducted for the RAS on Strengthening Debt Management during 2015.

RAS engagements for the MoPF followed on a functional review of the public finance sector
conducted by the World Bank in Romania in 2010. The recommendations from the functional
review were approved and included in the MoPF’s action plan. As part of the implementation of
this action plan, the MoPF requested assistance from the Bank to modernize the budget
execution and treasury functions, and the Advisory Services Agreement for Strengthening Debt
Management in the Ministry of Public Finance was signed in October 2012.

The Strengthening Debt Management RAS was designed to help bring debt and cash
management practices in line with that of other countries in the European Union by filling in the
gaps in policy guidelines for debt and cash management and by improving the execution capacity
of the Romanian Treasury in the MoPF. The World Bank team worked in close collaboration
with client counterparts in the General Directorate of the Treasury and Public Debt (GDTPD) to
complete a range of diagnostic exercises and training for the staff in the Middle Office (MO) and
Front Office of the GDTPD.
The effectiveness of the RAS in contributing to multiple sustainable institutional capacity
changes is described in Table 34. Perhaps the most notable achievement of the RAS team was
the early and ongoing progress in enhancing the capacity among MO staff for developing and
implementing a medium-term public debt management strategy, which culminated in the
approval of Romania’s Public Debt Management Strategy for 2014-2016.

Outcomes for the Strengthening Debt Management RAS are emerging or were achieved despite
notable challenges including leadership transitions within the GTDPD and persistent staff
turnover. Increased political support will be needed to implement the needed cash and liability
management policies that might involve changes in the role of the National Bank of Romania
and within units of the MoPF. Constraints such as these to further progress were identified by
the RAS team but not intended to be resolved during the limited RAS implementation period.

The second RAS designed to help implement the MoPF’s action plan for improving the
management of public finances was focused on improving human resource management for the
MoPF and subordinated bodies. RAS activities included an institutional analysis of human
resource management, assessment of the training needs of the MoPF and subordinated agencies,
development of a medium-term HR strategy and action plan for the MoPF and subordinated
agencies, and the training of civil servants at these institutions.


                                                         60
Diagnostic activities at the start of the RAS highlighted various challenges to effective human
resource management. First, MoPF policies are largely governed by those set by the National
Agency of Civil Servants (NACS), limiting the flexibility to adapt to changing needs. Also, the
HR Department’s role is mainly administrative and not strategic, and there has been no
restructuring or review of current HR deployment. There has been no recruitment for several
years and the recruitment process lacks transparency. Finally, there is also an inadequate
performance appraisal system and a lack of staff development programs.

As described in Table 35, the RAS was effective in producing key intermediate outcomes that
are likely to lead to enhanced organizational capacity related to human resource management
over the longer term. However, no evidence was available yet that the new HR strategy has
translated into any measurable changes in HR management practices. Going forward, the RAS
team recommended additional support to facilitate the successful implementation of the HR
strategy including designing an executive development program with a special emphasis on HR
topics such as group dynamics, coaching techniques, change/strategic management, the use of a
balanced score card, performance management, operational/process management, and total
quality management for all the MoPF managers.

The World Bank conducted a third RAS for the MoPF financed under POAT to strengthen the
capacity of the Ministry of Public Finance in fiscal and non-tax policy formulation. The RAS
team reviewed Romanian tax legislation on specific issues to compare them with best practice in
other EU member states, assessed current training needs to develop a training plan, and
conducted one-week training sessions for groups of MoPF and tax agency officials.

As described in Table 36, the RAS activities transferred knowledge to officials at the MoPF and
the National Agency for Fiscal Administration, which is enabling these organizations to
formulate tax policy more effectively. The RAS team noted that reports in the areas of property
taxation, oil and gas taxation, natural resources (oil) taxation, and VAT law were used to make
relevant amendments to the existing tax policy framework to align it better with international
best practice.

Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale: No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,
capacity change emerging, and capacity change in effect as defined in Annex 4.

The RAS was strongly driven by client demand, with the technical assistance for each tax policy
topic specifically identified and requested by the MoPF. Both MoPF and NAFA have
demonstrated increased capacity that is likely to be sustained. Political changes might have an
impact on some of the tax policy changes (i.e., labor taxation), but will not on others (i.e., VAT,
which is bound by EU regulations). In the future, the World Bank expects to continue the tax
policy dialogue with the GoR and to offer Bank services to work with the MoPF as needed to
bring about specific tax reforms.

The World Bank also provided advisory services to develop a unified and transparent set of
procedures for issuing clarifications, interpretations and rulings on tax issues based on requests
from taxpayers, NAFA or the General Directorates of County Public Finance (GDPFs). The
RAS team conducted diagnostics and comparative analyses to draft a new system procedure for
facilitating institutional communication and provided training sessions for the staff in the
selected directorates of the MoPF and NAFA.

As described by the project documents, RAS activities were designed in response to clear
institutional capacity challenges. The services and communication with taxpayers provided by
the MoPF, NAFA, and the GDPFs were not fully clarified with a large number of different
normative acts providing a fragmented regulatory and procedural framework. This situation
undermined the consistency and quality of information provided to taxpayers. Furthermore,
there were no integrated procedures within the MoPF, ANAF and GDFPs to facilitate
institutional communication in relation to issuing clarifications, interpretations and rulings on tax
issues. The system is highly decentralized, which makes it difficult to operate, both logistically
and from a quality control perspective.

This RAS was an interesting case given that it is likely to contribute to enhancements in all three
general areas of institutional capacity over the longer term. By design, the RAS directly
contributed to improving the formal system procedures (more efficient policy instruments) and
building capacity within the MoPF and NAFA to implement the new procedures (increased
effectiveness of organizational arrangements). Incremental progress for these two institutional
change processes, based on available evidence, is described in Table 37. However, it should be
noted that both of these changes are intended to lead to improvements in the broader socio-
political environment (strength of stakeholder ownership) over the longer term. As aptly
described in the Activity Completion Summary, the main criteria for establishing a process for
issuing resolutions is that “the delineation of power is transparent, logical and well-defined, so


                                                       62
that there is no confusion either among the taxpayers or the government about which Tax
Authority has to issue resolutions for specified subject matters.?

Note: Ratings are based on a six-point scale: No outputs, change initiated, knowledge gained, knowledge used,

While it is clear that the RAS has produced intermediate outcomes related to knowledge, skills,
and implementation know-how (i.e. the draft system procedure), there was not yet evidence
available for this review as to how these changes are being applied in the MoPF and NAFA.
Some of the recommendations are likely to be implemented through other World Bank support;
for example, the Revenue Administration Modernization Project (RAMP) will be able to provide
the resources needed to set up the IT systems for responding to taxpayer queries and resolving
issues.

Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure
The functional review of the public administration commissioned by Romania in 2010 and
conducted by the World Bank included Transport as one of the 12 sectors covered. As a follow-
up engagement to this review, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure requested technical
assistance for strengthening strategic planning and transport sector governance. RAS objectives
also included improving the MTI’s capacity for evaluating road and railway infrastructure cost
recovery, determining transport sector funding requirements consistent with EC directives and
principles, and ensuring the cost-effectiveness of road contracts. In addition to this direct focus
on enhancing the ministry’s capacity, RAS activities were designed to support the setup of an
urban transport coordination authority.

Overall, the advisory services were designed to provide the MTI with the tools and knowledge to
implement an ambitious reform agenda. The RAS spanned a broad range of issues and produced
24 deliverables. The approach of the Bank team was to facilitate a participatory process,
providing international best practice examples but leaving the relevant stakeholders to decide
what would work best in the Romanian context. The series of reforms therefore reflect an
ongoing process and will take time to complete.

                                                          63
The evaluation of the World Bank RAS portfolio did not include any interviews with
stakeholders in the transport sector. Instead, the assessment of this RAS is based on the review of
project documents and focuses on general areas of institutional capacity to which RAS outcomes
appear to have contributed. As described in Table 38, the RAS made effective contributions
towards establishing a coherent strategic plan for the MTI and building the capacity of the
ministry for prioritizing road and railway infrastructure investments and monitoring the
effectiveness of road construction costs. The RAS also provided support for reforming the
governance of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in the transport sector to move them from being
national liabilities to national assets.

To a lesser extent, the RAS also contributed to the institutional changes needed to establish a
fully integrated and sustainable urban transport system in Bucharest. High quality outputs were
delivered related to reviewing the current legal framework for the Bucharest Metropolitan
Transport Authority (AMTB) and prescribing transitional arrangements, drafting the AMTB’s
first strategic plan, and other guidance to provide a roadmap for transferring AMTB from MTI to
the metropolitan level. However, the implementation of key recommendations was delayed
given the volatile political environment, and high-level commitment will be needed to advance
these changes further.

To undertake the much-needed improvements in the transport infrastructure, the GoR anticipated
that a number of projects should involve private sector participation in the form of long-term
financing or operating commitments. The World Bank’s second RAS for the MTI therefore
focused on increasing the capacity of the relevant government agencies responsible for the
management, preparation and implementation of public private partnerships (PPP) in the
transport sector, with a specific focus on the road sector.

The RAS components included an institutional and legal review of the PPP framework, support
to the identification, preparation and bidding of a pilot transport PPP project, and capacity
building on specific topics covered by the activity. By design, the RAS targeted two important
institutional capacity challenges related to an inconsistent legal framework and inadequate
capacity within the MTI and subordinated agencies for implementing PPP projects. As described
in Table 39, the RAS team was not able to achieve the expected progress in these areas due to
changing circumstances during the implementation period.

A key clarification regarding the results of the PPP RAS is that part of the RAS was premised on
the implementation of a PPP program that did not happen. This meant that the counterpart could
not advance as much as was planned on the development of a PPP project. The RAS team
responded to this situation by changing, with the client’s approval, the scope of work to keep the
spirit of the RAS (and the development objectives) while adapting it to the reality of the practical
developments.

Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration
The 2007-2013 Operational Program on Administrative Capacity Development was designed as
an instrument to support public administration reform in Romania, but it did not have the impact
that many hoped it would. The Managing Authority for PODCA therefore requested World Bank
assistance to help increase the effectiveness of administrative capacity programs so that central
and local administrations can deliver better public services. The RAS focused on the analysis of
capacity building activities in the public administration to inform the design of PODCA for the
2014-2020 programming period.

The RAS provided diagnostic services across two components focused first on capacity building
activities to strengthen the civil service and factors that influence their effectiveness and second
on PODCA's Role in supporting the capacity of local governments and decentralization. The
team actively consulted and shared findings with key stakeholders throughout this process
including the MA for PODCA (the client), the General Secretariat of the Government, the
Chancellery of the Prime Minister, representatives of the National Agency for Civil Service, the
MoESR, Ministry of Health, the MoLFSPE and local government associations. The review also
included the analysis of the central NACS-managed civil servants database, documentation of
past projects, and a survey of 68 institutions from all administrative levels.

By design, intermediate outcomes achieved by the RAS were intended to contribute to the
increased “efficiency of policy instruments? by strengthening PODCA as an instrument for
guiding stakeholder actions related to public administration reform. However, as summarized in
Table 40, there was not yet evidence that the RAS contributed to this longer-term capacity
change. The outputs do not appear to have been used to inform PODCA design for the 2014-
2020 period. Furthermore, the team identified substantial implementation challenges related to
policy development processes and human resource management practices that will need to be
addressed for PODCA to achieve its agenda for public administration reform.

Romanian Competition Council
The Romanian Competition Council (RCC) is charged with guaranteeing market competition,
enforcing compliance with competition law, ensuring that state aid meets rigorous EU criteria
without creating market distortions, and promoting a broader understanding of competition rules
and benefits. The 2010 Functional Review of the RCC highlighted the need for a whole-of-
government approach to mainstream competition principles in Romania’s administrative
agencies. Based on the findings and recommendations of this review, the RCC and GoR
endorsed a Reform Action Plan, and the RCC requested the World Bank to provide advisory
services for increasing the effectiveness of competition policy and supporting the
implementation of the action plan.

The objective of the RCC RAS was to increase the effectiveness of competition policies,
including the enforcement of competition law, integration of competition principles in sectoral
policies, and enhancing the capacity of the RCC to efficiently perform its mission. RAS
components included a review of the legal and regulatory framework governing market
competition, advocacy activities to promote competition in public and governmental bodies,
implementation of a new business architecture in the RCC, and human resources capacity
building. The RAS produced more than 42 technical reports, 12 training sessions, and 12
advocacy events.

Overall, the technical assistance focused strategically on positioning and enabling the RCC to
serve as a competent and effective change agent to promote the achievement of development
goals related to domestic market efficiency, economic growth, and European market integration.
As summarized in Table 41, the RAS effectively contributed to numerous institutional capacity
change processes, including revisions to the legal and regulatory framework and improvements
in the systems and operating procedures of the RCC.

Given the scope of this broad review, the areas of institutional capacity targeted by the RCC
RAS that are described here should be considered illustrative rather than exhaustive. Project
documents provided the main source of information and did not necessarily reflect recent
developments. No RCC stakeholder interviews were conducted as part of this evaluation in
2016, but the RAS was one of the four RAS case studies conducted in 2015 for which selected
stories of knowledge results were explored.

and the level of information available via the desk review of project documents.

The outputs of the RCC RAS will continue to contribute to institutional capacity changes and
time must elapse before the effects of legal and regulatory changes can be fully assessed. The
implementation of the new business architecture for the RCC will evolve with the new releases
to maintain alignment with ongoing reforms.

The RCC and the World Bank expect to continue this collaboration through a follow-on RAS
using funds under the 2014-2020 programming period. This ongoing support will further help to
position the RCC as a center of excellence within Romania’s public administration and as an
agent of change for achieving domestic market efficiency, economic growth, and European
market integration.

                                      Competitiveness

Overview
The objective of the Operational Program for Increased Economic Competitiveness (POSCCE)
is to increase Romanian companies’ productivity, in compliance with the principle of sustainable
development, and reduce disparities compared to the average productivity of the EU.17 The
program was developed based on an analysis of the current status of entrepreneurship and
innovation in Romania with special emphasis on the small and medium-sized enterprises sector;
on resources for the research, development, and innovation sphere; on the ICT sector; and on
energy efficiency and environmental protection issues in the energy and industry sectors.

As listed in Table 42, only one of the RAS agreements included in this evaluation was under the
Managing Authority for POSCCE in the Ministry of Public Finance. The World Bank’s
engagement was specifically to support the priority axis focused on ICT for the private and
public sectors.

Ministry of Information Society
The National Strategy on Digital Agenda for Romania (NSDAR) is designed to foster both
economic growth and economic competitiveness. Some progress has been achieved in
implementing the strategy, such as the development of the National Plan on Next Generation
Access and Network Infrastructure (NGA, NGN) and the Smart Specialization Strategy and
Policy. As part of its efforts to further operationalize the NSDAR, the Romanian Ministry of
Information Society (MIS) requested World Bank assistance. The overall development objective
of this RAS engagement was to help the GoR in leveraging ICT to facilitate integration into the
European digital single market and align Romania’s ICT development with other countries in the
region.

Technical assistance provided through this RAS was designed to assist the MIS in the
implementation of the NSDAR. Specifically, the RAS team provided support related to
broadband infrastructure development and the real-time monitoring and evaluation of the
NSDAR. Evidence of the results of RAS activities and outputs were collected and analyzed
through a desk review of project documents and the survey of TTLs. No stakeholders were
interviewed in the ICT sector as part of the World Bank RAS evaluation.

As described in Table 43, the RAS effectively helped to address at least four identified
institutional capacity constraints. Notable achievements included building stronger leadership
commitment to the implementation of the NSDAR, informing potential changes to improve the
legal and regulatory framework for broadband services, helping MIS develop the capacity to
propose tailored solutions for broadband supply and demand at the community level, and
developing a real-time, online M&E system. RAS activities engaged and helped to address
capacity issues for the MIS, ANCOM (telecom regulatory authority), and most of the 17 other
public entities involved in the implementation of the Romania Digital Agenda (ICT Strategy).

At RAS completion, the team was aware of the remaining risks to sustainability regarding the
implementation of the NSDAR given the weak institutional capacity within MIS and the broad
range of stakeholders involved without roles and responsibilities being clearly defined. The GoR
has expressed an interest in a potential follow-up RAS to conduct a functional review of the MIS
to strengthen its capacity related to strategic planning, human resources, work flow processes,
and ICT.

          VII.                     Formative Feedback from World Bank Task Team Leaders and Clients

Overview
The data collection for this evaluation captured advice from RAS task team leaders and clients
about how to continue and strengthen effective collaboration for future RAS engagements. The
survey of TTLs focused primarily on documenting RAS results but included a section about the
TTL’s RAS implementation experience.18 Similarly, in-depth interviews with clients and other
stakeholders were structured to identify evidence of results but also included questions to explore
the quality of collaboration between the World Bank and the GoR. Findings presented in this
section are therefore based on survey responses from 20 TTLs, interviews with 19 stakeholders
representing the GoR, and a review of lessons presented by Bank teams in each RAS Activity
Completion Summary.

TTLs’ RAS Implementation Experience
The RAS TTLs were asked to reflect on their general RAS experience in Romania and indicate
which factors during implementation challenged the World Bank’s ability to achieve targeted
development objectives. As shown in Figure 3, more than half of the respondents (55 percent)
indicated problems related to the cumbersome WB administrative processes, the high turnover
and/or weak capacity in public administration, and the compressed timeframe of the RAS
engagements.

18
  TTLs with more than one RAS were asked to complete a separate results module for each RAS but only
completed the implementation experience module once. Therefore, there were 20 TTL responses providing
formative feedback based on the experience of implementing 40 RAS agreements.

                                                                               72
       The least common challenges indicated by TTLs included the limited availability of international
       experts, the lack of local experts, and the inadequate translation of outputs into Romania. Each
       of these factors was selected by only two respondents (10 percent). TTLs had the option to add
       comments to describe other challenges, which included differences with EU staff in Brussels on
       the main challenges to include in the scope of the RAS and underestimated costs. One TTL
       noted that “many Bank staff find it difficult to deal with a client that has clear demands and
       expectations.?

       Respondents also indicated which factors during RAS implementation helped the Bank’s ability
       to achieve targeted development objectives as shown in Figure 4. The most common facilitating
       factors included frequent communication with the client (75 percent) and having continuity in
       the WBG team, meaning that the same personnel worked with the clients on multiple RAS
       engagements (65 percent). More than half of respondents also identified the availability of
       relevant international expertise as a helpful factor supporting successful RAS implementation.

       TTLs generally indicated that their RAS engagements were relevant, high quality, and effective
       for achieving development objectives. As presented in Figure 5, most respondents provided
       positive ratings for how well the current structure and processes helped to ensure the RAS
       program’s relevance (77 percent) and high quality and effectiveness (79 percent). Nearly two
       thirds (64 percent) provided positive ratings for efficiency, in terms of helping to ensure that the
       RAS achieved targeted results at the lowest cost.

Fewer than half of respondents were confident that the current structure and processes helped to
support the sustainability of RAS results (44 percent). Concerns about sustainability were
presented in TTLs’ comments and were commonly expressed by clients, given that RAS
agreements often help support longer term reforms that require follow-up.

Although fewer than half (45 percent) of the respondents indicated that the current structure and
processes were very good (28 percent) or excellent (17 percent) for helping to ensure the
coordination of RAS implementation with other relevant WBG operations, TTLs noted in
various comments that the leveraging of RAS findings has been instrumental for preparing new
Bank operations. In fact, as presented in Figure 6, the RAS was the most highly rated instrument
in the Bank’s portfolio for effectively addressing development objectives in Romania.19

            Very good      Excellent


All except one TTL (95 percent) found the RAS to be a very good (60 percent) or excellent
(35%) instrument for effectively addressing development objectives. This share was sharply
above the proportion of positive ratings assigned for investment project financing (65 percent),
development policy financing (57 percent), economic and sector work (56 percent) and technical
assistance (54 percent). Comments throughout the survey mentioned the unique value of the
RAS and the importance of having the client pay for the services to demonstrate commitment.

Responses to the TTL survey reflect a relatively small group of stakeholders (20 TTLs), but the
ratings provide useful guidance for areas to explore for strengthening RAS results. For example,
the World Bank country management could consider whether there are any opportunities to
streamline administrative processes or help to facilitate the processing of documents and
approvals given the compressed timeline of RAS engagements. As explored in Box 14, TTLs’
comments and ratings indicated a need in particular to explore potential improvements in the
ways that units in World Bank headquarters support effective RAS implementation.

       Box 14. Example Reflection on the Need for Better Support from World Bank HQ
 “The most hiccups we had with the RAS implementation is the slow response from staff in HQ.
 Everything seems to move slower there and we consistently have things falling through the
 cracks (e.g. STC contracts that are not processed, Consultancy companies that are not being
 paid, documents that are not processed).?

Feedback from Clients
The design for this evaluation did not include a survey of clients to minimize their response
burden and to allow for a more nuanced qualitative data collection to understand RAS results.
Instead, guidance from clients on the current strengths and areas for potential improvements in
RAS implementation was gained through the Client Feedback Survey of FY14 Advisory
Services and Analytical Activities and customized semi-structured interviews focused on a
subset of the Romania RAS engagements.

World Bank Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) conducted the Client Feedback
Survey and provided the subset of the responses in the FY14 data linked specifically to the
Romania RAS program. This subset included 22 respondents reporting on 13 RAS agreements.

Although the TTL Survey and the Client Feedback Survey do not share the same questions or
rating scales, a general comparison of the response patterns by topic shows a convergence of
attitudes and experience across these two groups. As shown in Table 44, both sets of
stakeholders generally viewed the RAS Program to be effective, relevant, and of high quality.
However, they were much less positive about issues related to the sustainability of RAS results.
Fewer than half of TTLs (44 percent) indicated that current systems were adequate for helping to
ensure sustainability, and less than a quarter (22 percent) of clients reported that theKnowledge
used via the RAS was actually used and “led to change.?

Both surveys explored strengths and weaknesses of the RAS experience. For clients, this section
focused on what the World Bank did well versus poorly during RAS delivery. For TTLs, the
focus was on what factors challenged or helped to facilitate RAS implementation. While the
closed-ended response options were quite different, there were some areas of commonality. For
example, both clients and TTLs indicated that the success of the RAS program is helped by
frequent clear communication and by the Bank’s ability to bring together diverse stakeholders.

As part of the evaluation of World Bank RAS results for the 2012-2015 period, interviews were
conducted in March and April of 2016 with 19 clients to explore the results of 20 RAS
agreements.20 These semi-structured discussions identified evidence of RAS outcomes
(presented in previous sections) but also elicited formative feedback about how effectively the
World Bank was collaborating with the GoR and what changes might help to strengthen this
collaboration.

Together, the reflections on strengths and areas for improvement highlighted recurring themes
across sectors. These inform the following crosscutting lessons for future RAS engagement.

         Active negotiation and communication by both the Bank and the GoR at the start of the
          RAS engagement will promote smoother implementation and greater effectiveness. GoR
          officials from MoEF, MARD, MRDPA, and MoLFSPE in particular emphasized that
          strong engagement by both parties is necessary to identify and achieve the right
          objectives. Key ingredients identified for this success include that both the GoR and the
          Bank teams must be comfortable in describing any expectations and concerns and that the
          Terms of Reference and Inception Report should provide concrete details regarding
          processes and deliverables. Example reflections are in Box 15.

             Box 15. Perspectives on the Need for Strong Communication at the Start of the RAS
     “If there is a lack of interest from the beneficiary and an assertive TTL, then the results will not be
     good.?

     “Technical assistance must involve thinking about the details. The ToR should explain clearly what
     you want. When things are left vague, you might discover later that the RAS team had a different
     understanding of the task than what we had.?

      “There might be a misunderstanding. When we say we need a certain deliverable on a certain date,
     two or three months from now, that means that is the day we need to use it. So then we are
     confused and disappointed if we receive the report at 9 or 10 in the evening on that date and it has
     not yet even been translated.?
     Source: Interviews with GoR stakeholders


         RAS teams should consider whether RAS outputs (reports, strategic frameworks, etc.) are
          “useable products? for the client. Nearly all stakeholders interviewed expressed
          satisfaction with the quality of World Bank’s diagnostic work and reporting. However,

20
  A total of 31 non-Bank stakeholders were interviewed, and 19 of these were current or recent GoR personnel who
offered client perspectives. The remaining 12 represented local government, academia, and a think tank.

                                                        78
    they also made clear suggestions for how the RAS products could trigger and facilitate
    action rather than “just ending up on a shelf.? Their recommendations included:
       o Including local examples if possible to supplement international best practice
         examples to show how the concept or approach would work in the local context
       o Providing specific implementation instructions to articulate how the audience is
         expected to use the information, with concrete next steps
       o Summarizing dense narrative text in easy-to-read tables, with objectives,
         indicators, and suggested actions as appropriate
       o Placing a higher priority on the translation of outputs into Romanian, with at least
         one content expert engaged in the process to ensure that the language is
         technically accurate

   A more integrated approach to technical assistance will help to ensure that the client can
    apply the new knowledge and skills generated by RAS activities. Closely related to the
    lessons above, client stakeholders broadly reflected that the new generation of RAS
    engagements could include more comprehensive support by the World Bank to help
    ensure that the RAS outputs are used and recommendations are implemented over time.
    MoESR and MRDPA officials among others described the value they would gain by
    having a RAS include coaching or mentoring, as shown by the example in Box 16.
    Another common suggestion was that substantial “academic? reports should be
    accompanied by presentations and follow-up sessions to help facilitate their
    understanding and use.

   Strong collaboration by the Bank team requires frequent communication and a good
    grasp of the changing local context throughout the RAS implementation period. One oft-
    cited reason why GoR officials
                                                Box 16. Example Reflection for Strengthening
    valued their RAS engagements                            Future Collaboration
    with the World Bank was because
    they found the teams to be              “The RAS was the proper intensity and scope.
    responsive and adaptable. Key           Coaching would not have been good because people
    success factors described by            needed to get used to the external expertise. But
    stakeholders from CPM, MARD,            now we have reached the critical part of the change
    MRDPA, MoESR, and MEWF                  and the coaching idea is haunting me. An expert
    included having either a local TTL could stay here in my office and show me how to
    or a local senior specialist on the     address problems. We believe the future
    team who could meet with the            collaboration with the World Bank should include
    team on short notice if needed.         this.?
    Stakeholders also emphasized the        Source: Interview with MoESR stakeholder
    importance of engaging relevant
    local experts as part of the team
    and allowing the client to participate in identifying the best matches for address project
    needs. Examples of these common themes voiced by clients are in Box 17.

   Engaging the right stakeholders is critical, so the plan for doing this should be formed at
    the start of the RAS. As with the Client Feedback Survey and the TTL Survey, the

                                            79
        interviews highlighted the value offered by the World Bank as a convening power. Most
        GoR stakeholders mentioned the efforts invested by RAS teams to both identify and
        include relevant stakeholder groups in awareness raising and priority setting activities.
        This was viewed as critical to the success of the RAS and linked to the other lessons.
        The negotiation and communication during the design stage should include clear
        decisions about which groups to include and how to engage them, and a participatory
        approach should be supported as appropriate throughout the RAS period.


                Box 17. Reflections on the Need for Local Support and Local Expertise
  “We had good communication with the TTL and a chance to discuss everything hundreds of
  times. It is important in each project to have a good local team with people here on the ground
  that know the realities. They can respond to the most urgent issues.?
  “I don’t want to minimize the international experts—certainly important—but local experts really
  made the difference.?
   “I feel the need for more local expertise. They understand the context of the institutions. It’s
  about local context but also about culture: it’s very difficult for international experts to be giving
  the advice and more comfortable and familiar to rely on the local people. So the reform really
  needs to have both.?
  “We need really concrete inputs from the World Bank that work here in Romania. So for
  example, the project models need to be adapted to our legislation. We cannot just have
  examples from other countries. We must have the national context and therefore we need
  experts from Romania. Then we can understand how to use the information.?

Overall, the clients’ reflections on their RAS implementation experiences were very positive.
The teams were responsive and generally met or exceeded the expectations for providing high
quality technical expertise. Ideas for strengthening the collaboration largely focused on how to
further improve the evolving partnership between the Bank and the GoR given the established
trust and shared objectives.

VIII. Conclusions

Value of the Conceptual Approach
Reviewing the results of advisory services through the lens of the Capacity Development Results
Framework provides a meaningful assessment of how the World Bank’s RAS Program is
contributing to the achievement of development objectives. Rather than counting piecemeal
outputs and outcomes (e.g., number of officials trained, adoption of a strategy, etc.), the
evaluation assessed how targeted institutional capacity challenges were being addressed. The
method can be applied systematically across sectors.

Defining outcomes in terms of incremental progress along an institutional capacity change
pathway provides an immediate filter for relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability. Outcomes
lack meaning if they are not tied to a development objective. An intervention is unlikely to have
any long-term effect if it has supported only preliminary changes in knowledge, skills, and
behavior without helping to ensure that these changes can and will be applied in the desired
context. Therefore, any RAS that did not achieve at least one rating of “knowledge used? or
better to show progress in addressing an identified capacity challenge is unlikely to have
sustainable outcomes without some form of follow-up support to the client.

Given the broad scope of this evaluation, some assessments of individual RAS agreements might
be superficial or outdated. The level of detail included in project documents, the responsiveness
of TTLs, and the engagement of clients for interviews all varied widely across the portfolio.
This dynamic led to more detailed and up-to-date assessments of institutional capacity changes
for some engagements and summary reviews for others. Nonetheless, the systematic assessment
of each RAS allows for a comprehensive snapshot of how the World Bank’s Romania RAS
Program from 2012 to 2015 helped to improve the strength of stakeholder ownership (on the
demand side), and the efficiency of policy instruments and eff ectiveness of organizational
arrangements (both on the supply side).

Aggregate RAS Results
The evaluation documented some progress achieved by 38 of the 39 RAS agreements
implemented from 2012 to 2015 in addressing a total of 98 institutional capacity constraints. For
the majority of these improvements, stakeholders had already started using changes in
knowledge, skills, behaviors and/or relationships, and the changes were likely to translate to
stronger institutional capacity over the longer term without continued World Bank support.

Overall, RAS engagements reflected comprehensive support for public sector reform in
Romania. The program directly served 15 client organizations at the national, regional, and
country levels. Organizations that benefitted included multiple units within more than 20
ministries, agencies, commissions and other bodies of the GoR along with countless other
institutions at the sub-national level. Examples of these include local municipalities and regional
development agencies using new tools for spatial planning and urban development and school
inspectorates in all 42 counties receiving new regulations and guidance for organization and
functioning.



                                                81
RAS agreements were often designed to address more than one institutional capacity challenge
blocking the achievement of a development goal. Two-thirds of the projects (26) addressed
multiple challenges, according to the project documents and TTL input. The portfolio
collectively addressed 54 challenges related to the effectiveness of organizational arrangements
(37 projects), 34 challenges related to the efficiency of policy instruments (26 projects), and 10
challenges related to the strength of stakeholder ownership (8 projects).

Most of the RAS engagements (11 of 13) that targeted just one institutional capacity change
focused on improving the effectiveness of organizational arrangements. This streamlined
approach proved to be effective for strengthening organizations in relation to specific
development objectives: nearly two thirds (7 of 11) of these engagements resulted in new
knowledge being used, compared with only half (23 of 46) of the efforts in projects targeting
more effective organizational arrangements among other capacity changes.

Efficiency of Policy Instruments
The collaboration between the World Bank and the Government of Romania was most effective
for the elaboration of laws and strategies. Results assessed in terms of “more efficient policy
instruments? included changes in legislation, regulations, strategies, standards or other formal
incentives established to guide stakeholder actions more efficiently in pursuit of development
goals. Of 34 identified capacity challenges related to policy instruments, RAS engagements
contributed to ratings of “knowledge used? or better results for 26 of these.

RAS results played a critical role for helping Romania to leverage EU funding for achieving
development objectives. Bank teams helped to elaborate strategies to satisfy ex-ante
conditionalities for accessing European funds for the 2014-2020 programming period related to
lifelong learning, reducing early school leaving, increasing tertiary education attainment,
supporting the elderly and active aging, and promoting social inclusion and poverty reduction.
RAS outputs also provided the coordination mechanisms to harmonize State and EU-funded
projects for integrated planning and development, informed the policy lines regarding integrated
territorial development for the Romanian Partnership agreement 2014-2020, and contributed to
the design of the Community Led Local Development and Sustainable Development priority
axes for the new Regional Operational Program.

Effectiveness of Organizational Arrangements
RAS activities and outputs helped to strengthen the capacity of public sector organizations at the
national, regional and local levels. Evidence of effective improvements (“knowledge used? or
better results) was documented in 29 instances, commonly indicating an organization’s increased
operational efficiency, improved financial management, increased adaptability, or better
achievement of outcomes related to a development objective.

Most of the RAS results related to the effectiveness of organizational arrangements focused on
refining or reinventing administrative structures, systems, and/or processes. For example,
establishing criteria for prioritizing unfair competition cases will allow the Romanian
Competition Council to operate more efficiently in processing complaints about unfair
commercial practices. Local municipalities such as Alba Iulia are using new analytical
approaches and tools for a more efficient planning process, including pursuing inter-municipal

                                                82
planning with nearby cities and setting criteria for project selection and prioritization. Assistance
to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research included producing new regulations for
organization and functioning to clarify roles, functions and responsibilities across the pre-
university school system.

ICT-based tools developed by RAS teams contributed to improved processes documented at the
organizational level. Of the 14 instances where ICT solutions were designed to address
institutional capacity constraints, half (7) were rated as “knowledge used? or “capacity change
emerging.? An ICT prototype for institutional strategic planning and performance assessment
developed for the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is expected to be adapted and
used by other ministries to strengthen their strategic planning functions. An online monitoring
and evaluation platform with a performance dashboard is being used by the Ministry of
Information Society for evidence-based decision-making. Assistance to the Romanian
Competition Council resulted in automation of the mergers process for improved operational
efficiency.

Training activities alone were generally not adequate for building technical capacity in public
sector units. For example, the RAS for strengthening debt management included training on
cash management and liability operations, with participants demonstrating increased knowledge
as a short-term outcome. However, the RAS team observed that an internal reorganization was
needed within the General Directorate of the Treasury and Public Debt in order for the staff to
apply the new skills as intended. Other RAS training exercises were also expected to have a
limited effect without additional follow-on support, such as for monitoring the implementation of
new national strategies in the education sector, implementing a new methodology for managing
public private partnerships in the transport sector, and applying promising new sectoral analysis
tools for climate-related decision-making in the energy, transport, urban, and water sectors.

Strength of Stakeholder Ownership
RAS agreements tend to focus on the supply side. GoR requests for technical assistance were
typically for help developing laws and strategies or strengthening the administrative or technical
capacity of an organization. However, these efforts had limited success in cases where there was
inadequate stakeholder buy-in and commitment for participating in the process and
implementing the recommendations, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the demand
side during RAS design.

Only eight RAS engagements included design elements to strengthen stakeholder ownership.
These institutional capacity results on the demand side included increasing the commitment of
leaders to the achievement of a development goal, improving the transparency of information,
increasing stakeholders’ demand for accountability from service providers, and changing
widespread practices.

The portfolio was generally less effective in contributing to these demand-side changes. The
eight RAS agreements identified and targeted a total of ten capacity constraints related to the
strength of stakeholder ownership, but only four of these changes reflected Knowledge gaineds
or better results. In all of the cases, the RAS design included components for contributing to



                                                 83
multiple institutional capacity changes, without the enhancement of stakeholder ownership alone
being a clear priority.

The more effective engagements provided some guidance for what works best in building
demand-side capacity. First, a continuous or iterative process rather than a one-off forum or
event is needed to foster broad stakeholder participation and commitment to the achievement of a
development objective. Second, new findings and concepts need broad dissemination through a
variety of formats to gain traction in shifting public awareness and attitudes. Third, a change on
the supply side—such as a new organizational mechanism or new legislation—can serve as an
important lever for strengthening stakeholder ownership. For example, the RAS providing
support for the establishment of a Delivery Unit included a mix of activities in the energy sector
for increasing the transparency of information and helping to ensure that consumers demand
accountability.

Lessons
Effective changes related to more efficient policy instruments and stronger stakeholder
ownership are not achieved in isolation. Without exception, the RAS engagements that resulted
in knowledge being used or better results had at least one component focused on enhancing the
effectiveness of organizational arrangements. Even when targeted changes in organizational
arrangements did not lead to knowledge use in that area, the supplementary support seemed to
act as an important lever for helping the client to develop and adopt new strategies and
frameworks and to strengthen demand-side capacity.

An adequate authorizing environment on the client side is critical for strong RAS results. The ten
RAS agreements that did not result in “knowledge used? or better ratings all suffered from
limited commitment, motivation, and/or institutional authority on the part of the client leadership
for supporting the delivery of RAS activities and implementing recommendations. Some
examples include the engagements focused on building capacity in the Ministry of Transport and
Infrastructure for public private partnerships, on the enhancement of risk-based systems for the
Operational Program for Human Resources Development, on support to the Ministry of Public
Finance to strengthen public investment management, and on the analysis of capacity building
activities in the public administration for the Managing Authority of the Operational Program for
Administrative Capacity Development.

Both high-level (political) and technical-level commitment is needed for RAS engagements to be
effective. Efforts to establish a Delivery Unit in the Center of Government were challenged by
the limited involvement of the Prime Minister, Victor Ponta. For the assistance to the Romanian
Competition Council, the combination of high-level and technical-level commitment yielded
strong results for all identified institutional capacity constraints. In the Ministry of Public
Finance, there was strong technical-level commitment but more political commitment was
needed for implementing recommendations (i.e. reorganizing the Treasury, reforming public
investment management, etc.).

In addition to adequate commitment on the client side, other common success factors helped to
facilitate the achievement of RAS outcomes. These characteristics were frequently mentioned by
both clients and Bank team members as key ingredients to help ensure the desired RAS results.

                                                84
Most or all of the success factors were present for the 16 RAS engagements with evidence that a
capacity change was emerging or in effect.

In general, other factors related to the timeline and scope of a RAS did not appear to influence
how effective the advisory services were. Across the diverse portfolio, there was no correlation
between the progress ratings and the length of the engagement. The ambition of a RAS in terms
of the number of institutional capacity changes targeted also did not appear to matter as long as
the common success factors were present.

The turnover in public administration management and staff has challenged efforts to enhance
the administrative or technical capacity of organizations. For the climate change RAS, changes
in the leadership and key staff of the Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests have
contributed to the low implementation capacity of the ministry. Frequent management changes
at the National Agency for Cadastre and Land Registration limit its institutional capacity to carry
out its mandate as defined in the real estate RAS. Similarly, changes in management at the
Danube Delta Inter-Communal Development Association (ADI) and staff turnover at the end of
the ADI ITI Danube Delta RAS are likely to constrain the use of RAS outputs.

Finally, the World Bank’s standard approach to reporting RAS results does not provide useful
information for understanding and tracking needed institutional changes. The Activity
Completion Summary filed at the end of each RAS tends to include subjective ratings without
any associated theory of change through which to assess the quality and sustainability of
outcomes. In contrast, the CDRF-based approach to results measurement associates outcomes
with an institutional change objective to report on not only what progress was achieved but also
what progress is still needed.

Strengthening the Results Focus of RAS Engagements
The traditional measurement of outcomes has limited value in the context of frequent political
transitions and high turnover among public administration staff. Defining the pathways or
program logic for achieving institutional capacity changes extends beyond the knowledge gained
at a workshop or the strategy adopted by the GoR to identify what should happen as a result.
Thus, while Bank teams and their clients do discuss and document outcomes, they often miss
opportunities to situate these outcomes within a larger change process, link them to longer-term
targets, and plan accordingly. There are also rarely opportunities for continuing to document and
learn from RAS results after RAS completion.

More work is needed to foster a productive M&E culture within the Bank’s RAS Program. The
methods and findings of this evaluation indicate that the following steps would strengthen the
focus on results.
   1. Continue to refine the CDRF approach to build a common language related to
      institutional capacity changes. Both the desk review process and the survey of TTLs
      highlighted remaining challenges with the CDRF’s terminology, where the types of
      institutional changes and their accompanying characteristics are not necessarily
      commonly understood. Continued peer review and stakeholder engagement in the
      development of M&E guidance would help ensure the value and consistency of its use
      across RAS teams.

                                                85
   2. Integrate tools and guidance throughout the RAS cycle. Current Bank templates (e.g.,
      concept note, activity completion summary) prompt teams to think about and identify
      outcomes, but they fall short of tracing a theory of change for how activities and outputs
      will contribute to local capacity over the longer term. Simple guidance and checklists to
      apply during the design stage can help teams to identify up front what institutional
      changes are targeted by RAS activities and outputs and to negotiate changes in the RAS
      design if warranted. Any outputs that are not expected to contribute to institutional
      changes over the longer term should be removed if possible.
   3. Educate stakeholders about the value of M&E. Defining and tracking intermediate
      capacity outcomes as part of larger institutional change processes will allow Bank teams
      and clients to better plan, monitor, strengthen, and communicate results. When RAS
      results are presented in terms of outputs, such as a new analytical report or a new
      strategic framework, the benefits of M&E are lost. Discussions of RAS design and
      presentations of RAS results should include examples whenever possible to build
      awareness of how M&E can provide more value than burden.
   4. Create a system to disseminate and apply lessons from RAS implementation. Common
      themes identified during stakeholder interviews for this evaluation and for the case
      studies conducted in 2015 provide guidance and tips on how to strengthen the
      collaboration between Bank teams and the GoR. Similar themes are reported in the
      lessons section of the Activity Completion Summary for each RAS. However, there is no
      formal mechanism for sharing these lessons when new RAS agreements are being
      designed. At minimum, there could be a simple checklist of points to consider during the
      design phase. A central repository of lessons reported by TTLs would also be a useful
      knowledge resource.

Overall, the findings of this evaluation reflect strong collaborative results and a productive
working relationship between the World Bank and the Government of Romania. Incremental
changes to define and strengthen the results focus will help to further elucidate how RAS
outcomes fit within the Bank’s development agenda and to prioritize areas for additional support
when needed.

                                  Annex 4. Rating System for Assessing Institutional Capacity Development
Each RAS is designed to address one or more institutional capacity constraints that impede the achievement of a development goal. Progress for
addressing each targeted institutional capacity constraint can be rated by selecting the highest level along the continuum below that is supported
by the current evidence. This rating system was used to measure changes in three areas of institutional capacity: the strength of stakeholder
ownership, the efficiency of policy instruments, and the effectiveness of organizational arrangements.

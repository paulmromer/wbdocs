                 Summary of the Findings of the Four Analytical Studies


Background and Objective
The World Bank is re-engaging in the Education Sector in Burundi at a time when the country
has launched a major reform of its school education system, including the lengthening of the
compulsory basic education cycle to 9 years in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.
Due to the withdrawal of many donors from the education sector, after the events of 2015, as
well as the general fiscal and economic contraction, the gains achieved in the last decade,
especially in primary education, might be rapidly eroded. Consequently, a stock-taking exercise
was undertaken by the Bank, focusing on four areas identified at the time of the Concept Note
Review. This summary report is based on the four pieces of analytical work and is intended to
help the World Bank engage with all stakeholders in order to consolidate the recent gains and
move the reform forward. In the next fiscal year, the findings from these studies will be used to
engage in a broader dialogue and consensus building with the key stakeholders.

Introduction
Despite facing significant challenges, Burundi’s education sector is recognized as having several
strong attributes – has good student learning achievement in the regional context, is currently
in the process of reforming basic education, enjoys strong community engagement in schools
(particularly in classroom construction), and has experimented with a promising pilot in
education that uses results-based financing.

It is these strengths that the World Bank wished to understand so that, by building upon them, it
could support the Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Research (French acronym,
MEESRS) moving forward in the implementation of its ongoing reform. The Bank thus
commissioned the following four studies:

   a) The current state of progress of Burundi’s Education Sector Plan (PSDEF 2012-20201) at
      the level of basic education;
   b) The quality of Burundi’s basic education;
   c) The current state of progress of the PSDEF community-based approach to construction
      at the basic education level; and,
   d) The feasibility of scaling up a results-based financing approach in education that was
      piloted in Bubanza province.

This summary brings together the findings of these four studies.

Context
Under Burundi’s Education Sector Plan, basic education was to be reformed to be nine
years in length in order to: i) permit all children to complete the first three cycles (Years 1-6)2 in
a good-quality learning environment and ii) allow an increasing number of students to pass into
the new fourth cycle of three years. The first changes to the new École fondamentale, as it is

                                                                                                    1
called, were put into place in school year 2013-2014 and focused mostly on cycle 4 (Years 7, 8,
and 9). These Years were added successively until a new final exam was offered at the end of
2015/16, completing implementation of cycle 4. In 2016/17, the reform continues up into the
post-basic level and also loops back to the primary level to begin reforming the first three
cycles. To do so, the current school year (2016/17) is being used by the MEESRS as a preparatory
year before the reform is implemented in schools.

It is the upcoming reform of these first six years that has been central to the dialogue between
the Government and the World Bank.

A strength to be built on: a relatively good quality education.
Burundi’s results in PASEC3 2014 were the best amongst the participating countries,
especially in the early grades. Students in early primary years scored 627.7 in language
(Kirundi) and 605 in mathematics, a full hundred points above the average of the ten
participating West African francophone countries (Figure 1); this is the equivalent of
approximately 4 years of schooling. These results are consistent with the EGRA4 results carried
out in 2011 and 2012, which revealed that 39.7 percent of the primary Year 2 students assessed
were independent readers, 39.9 percent could read partially, and 20.4 percent were non-readers.

Moreover, Burundi’s overall performance was the most equitable across the PASEC
countries. The gap between the best 10 percent of pupils and the worst was 125.9 points in
reading and 168.1 points in mathematics. The next best was Niger, with gaps of 191.7 and 187.2
respectively; while Senegal had the largest equity gaps, at 279.3 and 271.2 respectively.
Moreover, in general, most pupil characteristics (such as not having books at home) do not
translate in significantly worse performance, in contrast to most other countries (see Annex 2)

However, Burundi’s student results in Year 6 are much closer to the PASEC average in
French language, though mathematics performance continues to be strong. The language
of instruction changes from Kirundi to French in Year 5 and this likely explains the relatively
poorer performance in the PASEC language test even though Burundi’s students remain above
average, albeit now in a group of similarly-performing countries rather than out on its own
(Figure 1, right panel). The continuing good performance in mathematics is likely due to
students getting a good grounding in mathematics in the early grades and are able to build on
that learning, even after moving to French as language of instruction. As the PASEC mathematics
test does not require a high level of French language comprehension, it may test students’
competence in mathematics.

This strong performance takes place despite the learning environment in Burundi’s
schools being average or below average in comparison to other countries participating in
PASEC. Class size and repetition rates are high, double shifting accounts for 46% of the
classrooms, and official schooling time is low (855 hours annually vs 914 in PASEC countries).
The classroom and school equipment levels are close to other PASEC countries’ average; there is
a lack of textbooks in the classroom (5.1% of pupils have their own textbook versus 35.7% in
PASEC countries), a lack of books in the schools (5.1% of schools have a library versus 12.4% on
average) and, at home, pupils have little opportunities to do homework: 45.7% of Year 3
teachers never give homework (see Annex 3 for more details). Violence is not unknown in and
out of schools. In other words, the learning environment is relatively poor in comparison to
other countries and so should not be conducive to achievement, and yet Burundi is an
exceptional case, as the study on quality suggests. Please see Annex 3 which reveals the number
of times Burundi is an exception to the rule.

What, then, accounts for these good student results?

A significant factor is the language of instruction. Kirundi is used as the language of
instruction in the first four years of primary school (before a transition to using French in Year 5)
in conjunction with the following complementary factors: i) Kirundi is a relatively simple
language to learn, orthographically-speaking5, because of its transparency; ii) the adult
population is literate6 (and so can understand the language of instruction and help their children
with school work); and, iii) Burundi is a linguistically homogenous country with 95% of the
population speaking Kirundi. So, in the early grades, teaching and learning is facilitated by the
fact that the medium of instruction is the home language of teachers and pupils. Interestingly,
the PASEC results for language at the end of primary corroborate this: when students are
assessed in French, they score just 525, similar to the average score of other participating
countries.7

Other countries where maternal languages are used do not have Burundi’s high performance. In
EGRA 2012, for example, just 20.4% of the students tested in Burundi were non-readers but in
other countries where a maternal language was the language of instruction, the percentage of
non-readers ranged from 35.8% in Uganda that uses Luganda to 88.2% in Zambia where
Chitonga is used. This may partly be explained by less consistent implementation of the policy
(either through having available materials, teachers who know the language, etc.).

Other factors such as pre-service training, classroom pedagogy and the curriculum, all of
which are amenable to policy change, are suggestive. These include the pre-service training
of teachers (about 70% have had two years of training in comparison to a PASEC average of
38%), the participative instructional strategies employed in the classroom, teacher attitudes
about teaching that are generally positive (according the PASEC teacher questionnaire), and the
fact that the official curriculum had been in place for some thirty years and which is therefore
known and understood. Additionally, amongst schools in Burundi, econometric analysis of
PASEC results reveals that results were higher i) where the number of pupils per classroom was
smaller than 60, and ii) where four or more pedagogical meetings were held.Finally, qualitative
evidence suggests that high expectations about what students can learn may be relevant:
according to the PASEC 2019 developers who are accepting item suggestions from countries,

                                                                                                   4
Burundi is the only country to have proposed many very complex mathematical items for the
end of primary assessment, which, according to curriculum specialists at the University of Liège
helping to develop PASEC 2019, would usually be found at middle school.

Despite this relatively better performance, there is a significant proportion of children in grade 2
and early primary grades who do not master reading or basic numeracy skills. Moreover, these
good results are however under threat going forward by the current pressures on the
system, a combination of the increase in the number of students and sudden budget cuts that
have caused a slow-down in the implementation of the reform.

Initiatives in the PSDEF to improve quality in basic education
The PSDEF proposed that quality would be improved through the development of a new
competence-based curricula for basic education, teacher training (both in-service and pre-
service) based on that new curriculum to prepare teachers to teach in the École
Fondamentale, and textbooks and pedagogical support. In addition, expansion of physical
infrastructure, as we will see in the next section, was intended to improve quality: new
classrooms would ease overcrowding and so improve the learning environment, and a reduction
in the number of double-shift schools was intended to improve the quality of the learning
environment by offering students a normal, not shortened, school day.

The new curriculum of the École fondamentale was approved by the Government in
August 2015. It was developed with the support of the International Center for Educational
Studies (French acronym, CIEP) in Paris. The reform of basic education started in the 2013-2014
school year, giving priority to the development of a new curriculum and textbooks for Cycle 4,
starting with Year 7. The development of Year 8 and 9 textbooks followed in April 2014 and
2015 respectively. In the development phase, the new program for the first three cycles was
inspired by those currently in use in Rwanda, Uganda, Mali, Singapore, France, Belgium and
Canada. The present school year, 2016/17, considered a preparatory year, is being used to write
textbooks for cycles 1-3. Then, before the implementation of the new program in 2017/18, first-
year textbooks will have to be printed in appropriate quantities. Based on the comparable
process of printing the 4th cycle textbooks it is estimated that the cost for the
5 books needed in Year 1, with one book for two children, at approximately $1.25 per book, will
be US$1.83 million.

In principle, initial teacher training programs should be reworked to conform to the new
directions of the PSDEF reform which, among many other things, has identified the need
for teachers to be able to teach to the new competencies. In terms of pre-service training,
initial training for primary level teachers occurs in colleges, which prepares teachers to teach all
disciplines in cycles 1, 2 and 3 (the D6 qualification). In contrast, teachers qualifying to teach in
Years 7, 8 and 9 (cycle 4) are trained at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and the University of
Burundi. They receive the D7 qualification. This revision of pre-service programs is also justified
by the introduction of new disciplines such as Kiswahili and entrepreneurship, and by the
versatility needed in cycle IV where teachers (D7) now teach several higher-level disciplines (like
middle-school level math with science or languages with history and geography). However, to
date, no re-design of the pre-service programs has taken place or is planned.


                                                                                                   5
As for in-service teacher training, about 15,000 Cycle 4 teachers were trained but this was
considered inadequate and even greater challenges exist for teachers for Cycles 1 to 3. The
training of Cycle 4 teachers was an accelerated program of five days, which trained 15,369
between 2012/13 and 2014/15 to introduce the new content, structure and approach.8 However,
it was not considered adequate by many stakeholders (as explained in the study on quality). The
design team from the Bureau for Basic Education Programs (BEPEF) carried out the training, with
support from experts from CIEP. In Cycles 1 to 3, at the start of 2016/7, the sector had 39,723
teachers, who remain to be trained.

Ministry officials are considering alternative approaches for training teachers in Cycles 1
to 3. According to ministry officials, several other approaches were tried during the introduction
of cycle 4 – i) a modular self-study program (the Francophone Initiative for Distance Education
for Teachers (IFADEM)), ii) the Nderagakura School Radio, and iii) peer-to-peer training in local
networks of teachers. It is this last initiative that some are proposing for the in-service training of
teachers in cycle 1-3. It was carried out by creating clusters of local schools (usually within a 5km
radius); these clusters formed the training network where teachers participated in monthly
training sessions. While these took place, other teachers covered their classes during their
absence (which was possible because the cycle 4 teachers in question always team teach).
Though they have not yet been evaluated, these peer-to-peer training networks seem
promising. This approach deserves consideration because i) it favors peer to peer dialogue and
the exchange of experiences in a non-threatening environment without the ‘weight’ of authority
being present or risking to intervene; and ii) because it requires the mobilization of little
additional financial or human resources. The research literature supports this form of training as
well.9 However, generalization would need to be accompanied by careful monitoring and
evaluation of the its effectiveness in changing classroom practice.

The challenge of expanding basic education, improving retention and equity.
The relatively good quality education enjoyed in Burundi is threatened by several factors..
The relatively good performance has been achieved in the context of rapidly increasing
enrolment, which is creditable. Nevertheless, rapid enrolment increase and the entry of children
of different ages makes it difficult for teachers to teach effectively.. Enrolment in the first year
has almost doubled in five years from 264,900 to 492,600 between 2005 and 2010. Almost every
child of the relevant age is now in primary education: the NER stands at 95 percent (up from 56
percent in 2005); this is significantly above the weighted SSA average of 71 percent. However,
there are still a large number of over-age children: the GER stands at 128 percent10: many
students start basic education at seven years of age, not the recently introduced official age of
six. Most recent data (2014/15) reveals that only 13% of new entrants are the correct age of six,
54.6% are seven, and 28.4% are older.

Second, repetition rates remain high and remain above the SSA average: in 2013, repetition
stood at 24.7 percent, though repetition rates have been dropping over time from 2010 to 2015
(Figure 2). In each year, the trend seems to be comparable: rates tend to drop from Y1 to Y4 but
rise in Y5. On the other hand, dropout rates show no trend over time from 2010 to 2014 (2015
data not available), but within years a trend is, once again, discernible: students tend to drop out
significantly in the first year, a phenomenon that drops over the next three years until it peaks

                                                                                                     6
again in Year 5. It seems likely that both repetition and drop-out patterns are caused by the
introduction of French in Year 5 or students’ lack of readiness for the former Y6 exam which
served as a gateway to further schooling.

Initiatives in the PSDEF to improve Access and Retention
In order to address these concerns and so improve universal completion in Years 1-6, the PSDEF
developed a strategy of five pillars, including: i) construction; ii) a reduction in double-shift
schools; iii) reducing repetition; iv) improved teacher use and deployment; and v) support to
schools. Progress against each of these four pillars is now considered.

Pillar 1: Construction. The objective of this pillar is to i) reduce overcrowding and ii) allow a
reduction in the number of double-shift schools.

Between 2012-2015, the donor partners built 1,608 classrooms of good quality, while the
FONIC built 2,012 and the communities built 2,884 rooms, both of lesser quality and at
lesser cost, (for a total of 6,504). The target was for 4,769 classrooms to be built, using a
community-based approach, in the first three years of implementation (2012-2015) for the first
three cycles (Years 1-6) of basic education, to which would also be added the renovation of
dilapidated classrooms.11 Over this period, 6504 classrooms were completed, of which 1608
were built by donors in the context of the pooled funding that supported the PSDEF (what
constitutes “community-based? construction is discussed below).

The two output indicators to evaluate overcrowding were not met. The first was “gross
enrolment rate (GER) in Year 1,? with the idea being that as construction of rooms proceeds and
measures to contain repetition are put in place, overcrowding is reduced and so the GER would
(theoretically) drop. The figures reveal that the GER remained more or less the same but has not
reached the anticipated targets. The second indicator to be used -- the ‘average number of
students in classes (‘groupe pédagogique’) for cycles 1,2,3’ -- was dropped in favor of
student/teacher ratio (STR) in cycles 1,2,3. While the baseline value for this in 2010/11 was 49,
the STR has actually increased: in 2012/3, it was 45, in 2013/4, it was 46, and in 2014/5, it was 53.

A strength to be built on: community involvement in construction.
It is probably best to take the figure of 1608 rooms built by donors as the total completed under
the PSDEF12, as the construction study explains, yet exactly how many employed a ‘community -
based approach’ is unclear. On the other hand, what is clear is that while the FONIC-financed
and ‘community-based’ approaches were
community approaches they were not part of
the PSDEF plan (that is, construction of
classrooms under these initiatives would have
continued with or without the implementation of
the PSDEF).

The many construction initiatives can be
grouped into three sets: those from donor
partners (under the common-pooled funding
arrangement (the FCE)), those from National
Communal Investment Funds (FONIC13), and
those from local communities.14 The quality of
construction depends heavily on the approach
adopted. UNICEF construction, that uses its own
standard building plan like other donor partners,
is of good quality. While the standardized
                                                     Source: Author calculations. Notes: Acronyms explained in

                                                                                                            8
municipalities. The work of the communities is at the lowest end of the quality spectrum, with
average to poor quality provided the walls are made of fire-baked bricks and very poor quality
and durability when the bricks are of raw clay. Unit costs also vary considerably, with UNICEF
construction being much the highest, while unit costs of community-built schools are only one-
third of UNICEF costs (Figure 4).

Given the large demand for new classrooms but the limited national budget, the challenge
moving forward therefore is to increase the quality of community construction, while
retaining an acceptable unit cost per classroom. A large number of schools and classrooms
will need to be built over the next several years. It is very unlikely that donor-funded
construction funds will be able to contribute in a major way given the high unit costs. There are
three options to move the community-based construction of classrooms forward:

       Option 1: Delegated authority to communities (‘collines’). Communes could formally
        delegate the necessary project management authority to communities (‘collines’) for the
        construction of classrooms. In such cases, the local communities act as delegated
        contracting authorities (MOD) on behalf of the commune. Evidence from many countries
        shows that local communities can successfully play the role of MOD for the management
        of small-scale construction of low complexity and cost - such as building classrooms or
        school sanitation facilities. This community led initiative would need to incorporate
        technical oversight, perhaps provided by delegated technicians, in order to improve the
        quality of construction.
       Option 2: The integration of a construction component into the RBF approach. As
        mentioned earlier, Burundi has just completed a pilot project that adopted a results-
        based approach to financing. The experience proved successful and, as discussed in
        study 3, might be expanded. If this were the case, empowering communities to build
        their own school - as described in option 1 – could fit perfectly well into such a RBF
        approach.
       Option 3: Aligning the Common Pooled Fund for Education (FCE), if it were reinstated, with
        FONIC resources. One way in which donors could help to channel resources more swiftly
        to communities would be by using FONIC procedures, which are currently in operation,
        understood, and can target the community level in question. However, the FCE is
        currently not operational due to the withdrawal of donors.

The first option, or the first two options together, are considered most promising. In either case,
it would be desirable that the MEESRS develop a National Strategy for School Construction that
would take stock of the situation in 2017, reset priorities in this context, provide a long-term
vision, and prepare a multi-annual school construction program.

Pillar 2: A reduction in double-shift schools.

The target for reducing double-shift       Box 1. Two kinds of double-shifts in Burundi. These are
schools was achieved. The second           commonly referred to as double-shift ‘linked to the
pillar focuses on reducing double-shift    teacher’ and double-shift ‘linked to the classroom?.
schools, through: a) eliminating           Double-shift ‘linked to the teacher,’ refers to a situation
double shifts ‘linked to the teacher’      where a teacher teaches two different classes (or groups)
(see Box 1); b) reducing by two thirds     of students in two shifts, one in the morning, one in the
the number of double-shift situations      afternoon. These shifts, of usually 4 hours each, are two
‘linked to the room’; and, c) modifying    shorter ‘school days.’ In comparison to a teacher who
the regulations governing the length       teaches a typical school day of 5 or so hours, the teacher
of classes in double-shift schools. The    who does two consecutive shifts is over-employed.
target for 2014/15 of reducing the         Double-shift ‘linked to the room’ refers to two different
proportion of double-shifting in the       classes of students, taught by two different teachers, one
public sector to 41% was exceeded          teaching in the morning, one teaching in the afternoon,
with the actual value reached being        who share the same room. Again, each child has only 4
34.6%.                                     planned hours of instruction. In comparison to a usual
                                           school day, these two teachers are under-employed.
Going forward it is likely that trade-offs between reducing class size and reducing double-
shifting will have to be considered. Addressing the double priority of reducing class size
(which, as we saw earlier, has not moved) and eliminating double-shifts entails significant
challenges, especially if the third priority of reducing situations where teachers are
underemployed is also desired (in situations where they are employed in double-shifting linked
to the room (see box 1)). In the current state of budgetary constraints, there will be trade-offs to
be made. It may be that in earlier cycles, where overcrowding is greatest, recourse to double-
shifting should remain temporarily in place, in order to reduce class sizes (to a maximum of 60
as PASEC analysis suggests), while in later cycles where overcrowding is less prevalent, double-
shifting linked to the room could be reduced (thereby allowing the redeployment of underused
teachers). This approach makes sense also because learning outcomes of students in double-
shift schools seems no worse than in standard classes, though this fact deserves more
investigation17. A revised strategy and action plan should be developed, perhaps by province, to
address this issue for the coming 5 to 10 years.

Pillar 3: Repetition

The quantitative targets for this pillar have not been met, despite good progress. In
Burundi, high repetition rates have traditionally been seen as a sign of a quality education, an
aspect of the school system associated with rigor. And it is true that Burundi has been able to
avoid the outcomes found in most other countries that a student who repeats a grade is less
likely to pass the second time around: there is no significant gap in performance on PASEC for
those who repeat for either reading or mathematics, in stark contrast to very high differences in
every other participating country (except Niger). However, high repetition rates create
congestion in cycles and increase the cost per student completing the cycle. Hence, the third
pillar aims to reduce repetition rates through a series of policy measures18, the most important
of which is the adoption of new policy stipulating that no more than 5% of students in the first
year of each of the first three cycles and no more than 15% of students in the second year of
each of those same cycles may repeat. Progress has been made in reducing repetition rates
though targets for cycles 1-3 have not yet been met. In cycle 1, repetition stood at 31.5% in
2012/3, 26.8 in 2013/4, and 24.3, for 2014/5 while the target for 2015 was 14%; in cycle 2
repetition stood at 23.8% in 2012/3, 18.5% in 2013/4, and 19.1% for 2014/5 while the target for
2015 was 17%; and in cycle 3 repetition stood at 31.7% in 2012/3, 27 in 2013/4, and 23.7, for
2014/5 while the target for 2015 was 20%.

Pillar 4: Improved teacher use and deployment.

PSDEF Indicator     Target for 2014/15           Achievement 2014/15 Comment
Variance in teacher 20 %                         25 %                No
allocation


There has been no overall progress under this pillar. The fourth pillar focuses on improving
the use and deployment of teachers. This was to be carried out in two ways: first, by reducing
the number of situations in which double-shifting ‘linked to the room’ takes place and by
increasing the number of hours in double-shift schools, both of which would have the effect of
reducing the number of teachers who are under-used (see box 1). And, secondly, through the
redeployment of teachers, a measure that was initiated in 2010 at the national level, to improve
teacher allocation on a nationwide scale. This has now been continued at a decentralized level
(provincially) since the introduction of the PSDEF, which is also expected to further rationalize
their use as it will address local teacher needs locally. However, for the moment, the variance in
the allocation of teacher deployment, the indicator to track progress in the PSDEF, has not
improved: it stood at 25% in 2012/3, rose to 30% in 2013/4 before descending again to 25% for
2014/5 while the target for 2015 was 20%.

Pillar 5: Support to Schools.

Progress under this pillar has been minimal. Actions under this pillar include: a) supporting
school feeding in zones of food insecurity; b) the implementation of specific support to



                                                                                               11
disadvantaged and out of school children; and, c) a ban on excluding students from school who
lack school supplies, uniform or school fees.

In terms of school feeding, the MEESRS has recently formed (in 2016) a school canteen
unit, which now works closely with the World Food Program that had been until then
working in the country in its own way. The challenges of food insecurity in the country have
repercussions for learning: children in some areas are not attending school because they are too
hungry to walk to school, or if they do make it, are often too tired to study effectively. Students
from different catchment areas have also been reported attempting to attend schools with
school canteens, which is creating inequitable situations of under- and over-crowding19. For
these reasons, support to the school canteen unit and expanding access to school feeding
programs would be important in the context of a lending project.

In terms of specific support offered to students, an initiative for special needs rather than
disadvantaged students has been started. An inventory of their needs was carried out in
2015/2016 with about 8,000 students being identified. In May 2016, the MEESRS established an
Inclusive Education Unit (Cellule Education Inclusive) within the Ministry, with a mandate that
includes nine initiatives. There are six pilot schools, three in the capital and three in Gitega, with
Notre Dame de la Sagesse in Gitega offering cycle 4 of basic education to special needs
students. However, very little funding has been made available (approximately 1,000,000 BIF),
hardly enough to cover the needs of one school, let alone them all or the requirements of the
nine initiatives. In addition, the new staff of the Inclusive Education Unit requires training.

Finally, the net enrollment rate now stands at 95% (2015), indicating that a small
proportion of young children are still out of school. This is due in part to children starting
their first year late in Burundi, very often at 7 years, yet also due to other serious factors. Analysis
shows that being out-of-school affects poor children living in particular rural areas, especially
children from the Kirundo, Ngozi, Cibitoke and Ruyigi regions, and boys a little more than girls.
The main reasons cited by families to explain this phenomenon are that children are too young
to attend (45%), the high cost of schooling despite being free (34%), and the distance from
school (8%). Overcoming these constraints is not easy, but the Results Based Financing pilot in
Bubanza stipulated that the school was responsible for seeing that all children of school-going
age were in school (which in Bubanza meant all 7 year olds) and significant gains in enrollment
were seen in a short period of time. See discussion of pilot below.

As for the ban on a student’s exclusion from school for want of a uniform or other basic
items, it seems that few stakeholders know of the ban even at the Ministry, which suggests
that the policy has not been well communicated and is very probably not known in schools. 20
The ban on excluding students is expected tohelp the disadvantaged.

On balance, progress has been mixed in reforming Basic Education in the PSDEF. Of the 29
indicators in the PSDEF, 8 targets have been achieved, 4 have not reached their target but
progress has been made, 9 have not been achieved and there is no progress towards the target,
while against 8 indicators, data have not or could not be collected. A summary table of these
indicators is found in Annex 2. That said, many of the targets that have indeed been reached
stem directly from straightforward policy decisions, like the introduction of a new curriculum or

                                                                                                     12
the improvement in transition rates into cycle 4 (from the cut-off point for those transitioning
being lowered), while those indicators meant to reflect progress towards the major objectives of
the PSDEF reform have not been reached. More students have access to the first cycles of Basic
Education but the objective of universal completion of cycles 1-3 is not yet achieved. . The
primary completion rate stand at 62%. In other words, policy decisions have brought reform to
Basic Education but this has not yet brought the kind of change desired in terms of improved
retention, progression, and completion rates, which require action at the school level..

The challenges to Piloting and Managing the PSDEF Reform
In order for the PSDEF reform to succeed, a) the necessary financial resources had to be made
available; and, b) the necessary institutional capacity needed to be strengthened including the
capacity of the Ministry to monitor the reform.

Financing.

The budget for the reform rose significantly until 2013, doubling in absolute terms from
2008, but then fell dramatically in 2015.21 Resources allocated to the sector increased
significantly from 112 billion BIF (72.0 million USD) in 2008 to 207.8 billion BIF (133.6 million
USD) in 2013. The budget in absolute terms almost doubled in this period, as well as an increase
in relative terms of total government expenditure (from 24.1% in 2008 to 29.1% in 2013). Donors
also contributed through the Common Fund for Education (French acronym, FCE) or directly.
The contribution accounted for 38.2% of the education sector budget in 2015, a record amount
for external support to the sector, but then dropped to 5.3% in 2016. FCE expenditures
supported both investment and recurring expenditures during the period, although the portion
devoted to current expenditures declined over time.

Progress on the reform has been hampered by factors arising from the country context
with funding falling and the need for new projections. The most significant factor has been
the Electoral Crisis of 2015 which led to EU donors withdrawing funding. This resulted in a drop
of approximately 86% in external funding. The Ministry has made adjustments to its plans,
principally by leaving the construction of funding to other sources such as FONIC.22 However,
even if progress were to have been made as planned, the plans themselves may now be out of
date. This is because with hindsight it turns out that the PSDEF reference scenario and
projections (Annex 7.3 of the PSDEF) are inaccurate. The scenario forecasts a population of 9.29
million in 2015. However, the ISTEEBU has already revised this figure year on year - to 9.82
million (5.5% more) and the United Nations to 11.17 million (20.5% more).

Capacity-building.

At the central and decentralized level, funding was initially planned and made available
for capacity-strengthening, but the effect of that funding on the ministry today is not
apparent. Directors mention that inadequate funding is prevalent and training needs are
pressing. The capacity of the Ministry to monitor the reform was also to be strengthened, the
indicator used to assess progress being the annual production of indicator reports. Progress has
been made on this count as statistical yearbooks have been produced, though whether the
2015/16 yearbook will be made available is unclear, after that school year was disturbed. The
Ministry currently works with the yearbook from 2014/15; some new data from 2016/17 is slowly
                                                                                              13
becoming available. The yearbooks are produced as a result of a labor intensive process starting
with paper-and-pencil surveys being completed each fall at all schools. These are then sent to
the Ministry where they are entered, by hand, into the database. Finally, in this context, a word is
needed about a communication strategy. The PSDEF reform continues to be poorly understood
by stakeholders, both in its broader strokes by the general public and in its finer details by
central and decentralized ministry officials and those on the front lines, at the school level. This
is hampering reform efforts and so needs to be addressed quickly and effectively. For the reform
to succeed, it needs, first and foremost, to be understood.

A strength to be built on: the pilot in Bubanza testing a results-based financing approach.
One interesting initiative in this context is the two-year pilot using a results-based financing
approach in the province of Bubanza. The objective of study 4 was to determine the feasibility of
scaling up of this approach. It includes three sub-studies: a) a descriptive study of the education
pilot project in the province of Bubanza; b) a descriptive study of the RBF healthcare project in
Burundi; and c) a rapid assessment of the governance structure and the monitoring and
evaluation capacity of the education sector.

The pilot project in education was launched in 81 schools in the province of Bubanza in
2014 and has shown initial promising results. The project was primarily funded by Cordaid, a
Netherlands-based development aid organization, and lasted two years, from 2014 to 2016.
Designed as an output (opposed to input) focused program, the service providers (schools)
outlined an action plan and corresponding indicators, and were compensated based on the
results they achieved. The greater the results, the more funding they were able to access. This
instilled an entrepreneurial mindset in the stakeholders.

The pilot included six key characteristics that have been identified in the RBF literature as
crucial to the success of this approach: autonomy, establishment of contracts, transparency,
government buy-in, monitoring and evaluation system, and definition, separation and
decentralization of roles. Some aspects were stronger than others: the autonomy and
establishment of contracts was one. Empowerment (of school management committees) to
make decisions instilled an openness to ask questions and develop localized solutions to
problems, while contracts and action plans ensured understanding by all stakeholders.
Transparency, government buy-in and role definition and separation were relatively strong as
well. A transparent environment encouraged participation from the community, teachers,
administrators and government officials. The government’s support and integration of RBF into
the National Strategic Plan portrayed its commitment to improving the education system, and
the separation of roles ensured accountability of each actor. The last component, monitoring
and evaluation system, is in need of the most improvement: ts data collection system was
inefficient, requires the restructuring of roles, and needs updated M&E tools.

The project was in existence for only two years with one year dedicated to initial set up,
and the identified weaknesses may be a sign of early implementation rather than
fundamental problems. In addition, there existed overarching challenges to program
implementation, including economic constraints of schools and students, remote school

                                                                                                 14
geographies and adverse weather, and insufficient infrastructure, teachers and resources.
Program implementation deficiencies observed included inefficient payment mechanisms,
questions of cost efficiency and sustainability, effective stakeholder motivation mechanisms, and
data collection methodology.

Initial statistics, provided by Cordaid, indicate improvements in teacher attendance,
teacher performance, quality and content of education, and school-parent relationships in
the pilot schools.23 No independent evaluation of the program has been undertaken and the
Bank team has also not been able to access the databased. However, due to the limited two-
year lifespan of the pilot, this study cannot provide insight into program impact or draw causal
links between educational outcomes in Bubanza and the program. Further analysis needs to be
done on the indicators – with a special focus on the quality indicators – and on the costs and
sustainability of the initiative. The amount of data collection and reporting at the school and
other levels also needs to be assessed.

RBF in health is now a national program, having taken a pilot project to scale . A RBF
healthcare project in Burundi was also primarily funded by Cordaid, beginning as a health
project in three provinces in Burundi in 2006 (Bubanza, Cankuzo and Gitega). With consensus
from donor partners and the GoB, it was scaled up to be a program at the national level in 2010.
It was also adopted into the 2005-2015 National Health Policy. The healthcare program
separates four main roles: purchasing, regulation, verification and service provision. Since the
establishment of the program, the country has seen extraordinary improvements in health
outcomes. The rate of consultations for children under five years rose five-fold; births attended
by skilled personnel rose from 30% in 2005 to 73% in 2015; and the percentage of students
vaccinated increased to over 90%. In addition, the rate of completion and promptness of data
collected through the use of verification increased, and the quality of services provided in health
centers improved. In contrast to the education system, the health management information
system in Burundi is very well established, facilitating the review of performance indicators,
comprehensive M&E tools, and a multi-step validation system to ensure the reliability of the
data. The one drawback of the system is that it may be seen as costly24 and requires the
involvement of many RBF actors. The payment process has multiple actors involved in the
approval of payments for increased security but is completed within 50 working days of the end
of the reporting period (this is one of the performance indicators).

The assessment of the governance structure and the M&E capacity of the education sector
provides insight into the feasibility of scaling up the RBF education project. It was
observed that both the governance and M&E structure in education were not sufficiently
strengthened during the brief pilot project. The M&E system is currently disjointed; data are
collected at different levels (municipal, provincial and national) and are not integrated. The M&E
capacity in the education sector would need to be strengthened prior to scaling up the RBF
pilot. In terms of governance, the basic education sector has a three-tiered governance system
with autonomous community-based schools comparable to that of the health sector (national,
provincial, communal)..


                                                                                                15
The primary weaknesses observed in both the RBF health program and the education pilot
were associated with funding streams (from both the donor and government) and
sustainability of the program in the long-run. Cost efficiency is the largest concern in scaling
up RBF in education and, given that the health sector already identifies consistent funding as an
issue, this could lead to competing demands for funds, especially from the national government.
That said, there are cost efficiencies that could be drawn from the pre-existence of the RBF
health program in Burundi, such as M&E tools (survey instruments, software, technical expertise,
etc.) and institutional groundwork (pre-existing buy-in of the national government as a result of
successes observed in health).


Conclusion
There are several strong points to Burundi’s education sector, as the four studies have made
very clear, which suggest ways in which the World Bank could support Burundi’s ongoing PSDEF
reform of Basic Education.

In terms of sustaining the relatively good quality of Basic Education, the focus should be on
mastery of early literacy and numeracy by all children in the early years. This would require
helping teachers to teach reading and mathematics efficiently, with provision of adequate
textbooks, reading materials and assessment tools. The Bank should consider supporting the
teacher training networks started under the reform of cycle 4, in order to ensure that cycle 1-3
teachers also benefit from the advantages of having support from other teachers on an ongoing
basis when faced with the new curriculum that they must master. The relatively weaker
performance of students once French becomes the language of instruction in Year 5 needs
addressing.

In terms of improving access and reducing overcrowding, the WB should promote a strategic
approach to construction that leverages the dynamism of the locally-led community-based
approaches that are currently practiced across the country, but with the technical quality of the
construction improved through third-party oversight and a strengthened and agreed-upon
standardized building plan. A strategy is also needed which sets criteria for school construction,
balancing progress against double-shift schools (of both types) and reducing student-teacher
ratios.

In terms of improving progression, especially in the early years, a multi-pronged approach will
be called for. First, parents should be mobilized to send children to school at the right age.
Second, student attendance should be monitored regularly and those at risk of dropping out
should be identified and actions taken at the school level in cooperation with parents. In regions
of high food insecurity, school feeding programs could be considered. Reduction in the
repetition rates can be brought about through focused action at the school level, concentrating
on the one hand on improving attendance, and on the other hand, by improving learning so
that children can cope with the curriculum in the next grade.




                                                                                               16
In terms of improved management, the WB should consider expanding the RBF pilot to
strengthen service delivery in schools and management capacity in decentralized education
units, such as the provincial and communal level education authorities and inspectorates. In
addition, central level departments, most notably the Planning and Statistics department, must
be strengthened so that they may play the part required of them in this scale-up.

These issues will be discussed with the Ministry of Education as well as other stakeholders and
partners as part of the on-going preparation of the new project focused on improving learning
and student progression in the early grades.

To be noted:

         1. The circled figures represent the total number of classes built by donors during the three
            years of the first phase of the PSDEF for a total over the period of 1608. The total of 79
            for 2016 is also included in this figure as these classes were begun in the timeframe in
            question. Above the circled totals are the total number of classrooms (in light blue) by
            any donor for the period.
         2. Directly below the circled figures are the totals for construction financed by the FONIC
            (in yellow).
         3. Below that are the totals for construction carried out by communities (also in yellow).

  The literacy rate for 15-24 year olds is 87.6% (UNESCO UIS 2015), one of the highest in SSA.

   It cannot be excluded, given high dropout rates, that only the best students get through to year 5 to do year 5
PASEC evaluations. If this kind of selection bias is indeed at play, this would lessen the emphasis we should place on
what might appear to be good results in year 5. The results in year 2 remain less troubled by this phenomenon.

   The research literature suggests that in-service teacher training which focuses on classroom management, content
and/or specific pedagogical techniques (rather than general pedagogy) and contained regular follow-up, lead to
highest gains. Interestingly, providing textbooks alongside training was also associated with test score gains. An
analysis of PASEC results from Burundi corroborate these findings. For instance, test scores improved in those schools
in Burundi where 4 or more regular pedagogical meetings took place (RESEN 2016, p.85). See, for instance, Anna
Popova, David K. Evans, Violeta Arancibia. 2016. “Training Teachers on the Job: What Works and How to Measure It.?

    The primary Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) grew by about 49 percentage points between 2005 and 2014 (from 79 to
128 percent), while the primary Net Enrollment Ratio (NER) grew about 39 percentage points from 56 percent to 95
percent. Increases in secondary GERs were also significant (now standing at 40 percent), though pre-primary and
tertiary increases were much less spectacular.

    The reported progress for the indicator established to track community based construction in the PSDEF shows just
380 classrooms built between 2012-2015, but how this total has been calculated is unclear and so should probably be
disregarded. See Annex 3 of Study 1.

     To better understand what a ‘community-based approach’ means in Burundi, it is important to distinguish between
the terms ‘community’ and ‘commune.’ Local communities, basically villages, (called in Burundi ‘colline’) make up the
smallest identifiable municipal grouping in the country. ‘Communes,’ on the other hand, are the most decentralized
level of government, after province. In a commune, there are typically several communities. With this in mind, there
are three community-level approaches to construction currently in operation. First, local communities, through school
management committees, play an active role in their local school, not only in contributions to running costs but also
in contributions for the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms. Recognizing the need for a new classroom, for
instance, parents are willing to pay for materials such as baked bricks and to contribute their labor to build a modest
classroom. This, they do on their own. They may take advantage of a national initiative to request that a roof, which is
identifiable by its blue color, be provided by the Presidency. Secondly, as part of a long tradition of “ community
work,? communities, organized by communes, are expected to go out one day a month and work together on
projects deemed of importance, like building roads, ditches, and sometimes schools. These events have become
politicized. Thirdly, each of Burundi’s 128 communes receives a set amount of funding from the central government
as a part of its decentralization initiative. These FONIC payments may be used for any number of recognized
communal projects – health centers, stadiums, roads, and so on. If chosen, schoolrooms may also be built.

decision making in schools; b) prohibiting requests from families for voluntary repetition; c) establishing measures to
help reduce what was judged to be the excessively demanding expectations of teachers vis-à-vis repetition (that is,
teachers used it often expecting it would lead to having a remedial effect – which is not necessarily the case); d)
promoting information campaigns about repetition with families and schools; e) putting into place automatic
transition within cycles 1, 2, and 3; f) implementing a performance-based grant for schools that reach targets for
improved repetition rates

     According to UNICEF (UNICEF, 2016)

    The question is how the MEESRS can redress the situation. Firstly, it should be recalled that the reform is still
accompanied by the former FCE funding (about US$20M), although it is currently managed directly by UNICEF and
continue to fund the three main areas of the reform: access, quality, and piloting and management of the reform.
Nevertheless, means are lacking and so given the limited room for maneuver, the MEESRS has had to identify certain
priorities: for example, it has decided to leave the financing of school construction to other sources, such as the
National Funds for Communal Investment (FONIC) even if these funds are used to finance various communal needs,
like roads, ditches, classrooms, and so on, depending on needs). MEESRS also counts on donors to continue to take
part in the reform. So, for instance, the CTB, though retired from the FCE, continues to work at the post-basic level.
The MEESRS also appealed to the Pôle de Dakar. Normally the Pole does not accept to help produce a State Report
on the National Educational System (RESEN) based on older data. However, even though the 2015/16 school year was
too disturbed to produce a statistical yearbook, the Pole agreed to accompany the MEESRS in the drafting of a 2016
version of the RESEN, given the situation, though in this case a three-year transitional plan to help the sector emerge
from the crisis will be developed.

   Unfortunately, no data is available in other schools so no comparisons can be made.

   The cost of the education pilot in 81 schools in Bubanza for two years was 948,000,000BIF (approximately
US$550,000).

1. OVERVIEW

1.1. Where do we stand now and how did we get here?
1.      Nicaragua remains one of the poorest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC). About 30 percent of the population lived below the official poverty line in 2014, and eight
percent were considered extremely poor. GDP per capita stood at about USD 2,087 in 2015, the
second lowest in LAC after Haiti. Access to basic services, such as electricity and water and
sanitation, is low and largely unequal. Other key social indicators, including access to education,
completion rates, and teenage pregnancy, also lag behind the regional average.

2.      It is hard to understand Nicaragua today without having a close look at its past 70
years of development dynamics. The Somozas ruled Nicaragua for over four decades until 1979,
with growth benefiting mostly the country’s elite. Between 1950 and 1977, Nicaragua’s income
per capita doubled to USD 3,3491 but the benefits of such growth failed to be shared among the
vast majority of the population as wealth and land ownership were concentrated in a few hands.
Social indicators also lagged behind the region: in 1970, average life expectancy at birth was about
54 years, under-five mortality was the second highest in Central America, primary completion was
just 25 percent, and 48 percent of primary school-age children were not enrolled in school.

3.      Armed conflict, natural disasters, and economic mismanagement characterized the
1970s and 1980s, impacting per capita GDP. In 1972, an earthquake struck the capital city
(Managua), destroying physical assets of about 35 percent of GDP and leaving a death toll of over
6,000 people. The mismanagement of international aid relief by the Somoza family and the
National Guard in the aftermath of the earthquake led to widespread discontent and fueled the
Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional (FSLN), which eventually toppled the regime in 1979.
The armed conflict in the 1970s was extremely costly, with estimates of human casualties as high
as 35,000. Serious damage was also inflicted on the country’s infrastructure and productive
capacity. Throughout the 1980s, inadequate economic policies rendered market institutions weak,
and social and military spending in response to the contra-revolutionary insurgence (Contra War)
resulted in major fiscal and external imbalances, and hyperinflation. GDP per capita declined
steadily during the 1980s. At the end of the decade, Nicaragua was one of the most highly indebted
countries in the world while social conditions also reflected the extent of the economy’s
deterioration: infant mortality (72/1,000), maternal mortality (159/100,000), and moderate and
severe malnutrition (affecting around 13 percent of children under five).2

1.2. Factors behind the rebound
4.      Since the country’s democratic transition in the early 1990s, Nicaragua has
undergone a solid economic recovery from a very low base, due to three main factors. These
include i) improved macroeconomic management and debt relief; ii) reforms aiming at
transforming Nicaragua back into a market economy; and iii) demographic change. As a result,
real GDP growth averaged about 4 percent between 1994 and 2015.

5.       First, the implementation of a macroeconomic stabilization program, which together
with debt relief, lay the foundation for steady economic recovery. A stabilization plan in 1991–
1992 supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) helped lower fiscal and current account
deficits to more manageable levels and brought inflation down to single digits.3 Moreover, debt
relief from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) in the mid-2000s played a critical role in freeing up fiscal space for social and
infrastructure spending and supporting macroeconomic stability. Moreover, the country has
remained strongly committed to macroeconomic stability and prudent fiscal policies.

6.     Second, structural reforms have supported economic recovery through increased
market competition. These reforms aimed at transforming Nicaragua back into a competitive
market economy and included trade liberalization and abolition of state trading monopolies,
approval of a new Bank Superintendence Law, restructuring of the state-owned banking sector,
modernization of police and armed forces, and divesture of state enterprises.

7.     Third, demographic changes have also contributed through an increase in labor
supply. Declining fertility rates have resulted in a reduction of the young dependency ratio and an
expansion of the share of the population of productive age (15–64). Nicaragua’s working-age
population increased almost threefold over the past 40 years (or by about 2.5 million persons).
Today, 50 percent of the population is under 25 years old. The labor supply effect contributed to
about half of the average increase in GDP per capita over 1990–2015 (or slightly less than one
percentage point increase over an annual increase of 1.9 percent in GDP per capita).

8.      Despite the recent uptick, Nicaragua has not been able to keep pace with comparators
on per capita income growth and convergence. Its per capita GDP has not been able to recover
to 1977 levels. In terms of convergence, Nicaragua had a similar per capita income level to
Mauritius and Malaysia 40 years ago. GDP per capita also shows an important divergence relative
to the United States (US). In 1960, GDP per capita in Nicaragua was roughly USD 1,535 (in 2010
constant dollars) or one-eleventh of that of the US. As of 2015, it was only 3.6 percent of the US
GDP per capita.

9.       The growth rebound has mostly relied on factor accumulation, primarily on a
growing labor supply, and to a lesser extent on capital accumulation. Labor has been the
strongest contributor to growth over the last 15 years.4 This is in line with the decline in fertility
rates and the expansion of the working-age population in the country, together with increasing
female labor participation rates. Capital accumulation has played a growing role over time.
However, infrastructure and access to basic service indicators and their international comparisons
point to a large infrastructure gap. Nicaragua’s land productivity is also the lowest among regional
peers, with average value generated only USD 717/ha (constant USD). To put this into perspective,
this is between 40–60 percent of average figures for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and
only 16 percent of Costa Rica’s. Overall, the recent trend in productivity is promising: after either
negligible or negative contributions over 2000–2009, total factor productivity (TFP) contributed
positively over the last five years and labor productivity has rebounded since 2009.

10.    Solid growth contributed to a significant decline in poverty since 2005, yet levels
remain elevated and Nicaraguans are highly vulnerable to falling back into poverty. A one
percent increase in GDP per capita was associated with a 1.7 percent reduction in overall income
poverty between 2005 and 2014. The share of individuals with consumption per capita below the

 This is consistent with findings in Sosa et al. (2013) that labor (adjusted by education) contributed the most since
1980; however, the importance of both capital accumulation and TFP has increased in recent years.

                                                                                                 3
official extreme poverty line more than halved during this period, whereas the share of the
population living under the overall poverty line fell by more than a third. Poverty is primarily
concentrated in rural areas, where an estimated 1.2 million persons were poor in 2014. Even as
many individuals escaped poverty over the last ten years, around one in six non-poor Nicaraguans
were at risk of falling back into poverty, demonstrating the fragility of these recent gains.

11.     Labor income, remittances, and household composition changes were the main
drivers of poverty reduction. Labor income represented three quarters of total incomes at the
bottom 40 percent of the income distribution in 2014. Higher labor incomes contributed to more
than two thirds of the decline in both extreme and overall poverty between 2009 and 2014. That
contribution resulted from higher earnings in agriculture due to rising commodity prices for food
products, rather than more employment in the sector or the transition of workers to higher paying
sectors. This suggests that cyclical factors rather than structural policies were among the main
drivers behind the recent progress towards the twin goals, underlining the fragility of these gains
to changes in the external environment. Remittances have become more pro-poor and contributed
to some extent to poverty reduction.5 Demographic changes, which resulted in smaller household
sizes and falling dependency ratios, also reduced poverty. Public transfers, due to their small size
and inadequate targeting, had limited impact on poverty reduction.

12.     While high by international standards, inequality in Nicaragua is relatively low
compared to other LAC countries. Inequality fell in Nicaragua and the Gini coefficient
decreased from 0.49 to 0.44 between 2005 and 2009. This trend was somewhat reversed in the
following five years, as inequality rose to 0.47 in 2014, as a result of higher income growth at the
higher end of the income distribution. This seemingly low inequality relative to regional standards
helps explain why poverty is lower than expected for countries with similar levels of economic
development. Per capita household income of the bottom 40 percent grew at an annualized rate of
2.5 percent between 2005 and 2009, and accelerated to 5.2 percent between 2009 and 2014.

13.     Evidence suggests a low education premium due to the low quality of formal
education and labor market mismatches. Several studies suggest that the low quality of
education could potentially explain that lower demand for more educated individuals.6 Low returns
to education could also be the result of a mismatch between those skills offered by the formal
education system and those demanded by employers: Nicaraguans do not have the skills to fill
labor market demands.7 Declining education premia in Nicaragua appear to be one of the main
drivers of the inequality reduction before 2009: the returns of tertiary education compared to
secondary education decreased by 6.2 percent on an annual basis between 2005 and 2009.8

14.     Delivery of basic services, access to quality education, and fiscal policy tools, including
social assistance programs, have had a limited impact on reducing income inequality. Access
to basic services and education remains unequal and of poor quality, which has contributed to some

  See World Bank (2016) and Gindling and Trejos (2013) on the low quality of education. Gindling and Trejos (2013)
also suggest that the commodity boom could partially explain an increase in exports of unskilled labor-intensive
products, translating into declining returns to education through higher real earnings among less educated workers.

extent to high levels of income inequality by international standards. Access to basic services in
Nicaragua is among the lowest and most unequally distributed in LAC, especially water,
electricity, and sanitation. The country is also lagging behind in terms of quality of these services
among the most vulnerable groups: water provision in rural areas lacks continuity and suffers from
pollution. Poor access to these services results in greater health risks, especially among children
under five. There are marked disparities in access to education between income groups and areas
of residence and enrollment is particularly low in rural areas and for those at the lower end of the
income distribution. Low retention rates, together with quality of education issues, also raise
serious concerns. Fiscal policy in general, and social assistance programs in particular, have played
a modest role in addressing income inequality.

1.4. What’s the way forward?
15.     Given its per capita income level, a growth model based on improved factor
accumulation can continue to serve Nicaragua to some extent over the medium-term. GDP
growth improved vastly over the past two decades and helped the country reduce poverty
significantly. In order to accelerate and sustain growth over the short and medium-term, Nicaragua
can still rely on improved factor accumulation (that is, labor and capital). But this requires
education to harness the full potential of the ongoing demographic transition as well as basic
infrastructure (road networks, electricity, water, and access to basic services) to foster private
sector activity and trade, and promote inclusion while attracting fresh private capital.

16.     Improving the overall education and skills of the population will be key to take full
advantage of the demographic transition. Educational outcomes point to important deficiencies.
Fewer young adults in Nicaragua have completed secondary education compared to other lower-
middle-income countries. The lack of infrastructure, teachers, and population dispersion in rural
areas has favored an increase in multi-grade schools. Despite being a cost-effective solution, this
results in higher dropouts and widens the educational gap between rural and urban areas. In
addition, high prevalence of teenage pregnancy has important consequences for development and
growth, as it is highly associated with female school dropout, poorer labor outcomes and poverty.9
Empowering young population cohorts with more equal access, better quality of education, and
better suited skills can go a long way to build up human capital and raise productivity. Poor
educational attainment, low quality education, and inadequate skills that do not respond to labor
market needs preclude new entrants from securing better paying, higher productive jobs.

17.     Given Nicaragua’s characteristics and large infrastructure gap, investments,
particularly in roads, energy, and water storage and distribution, are likely to generate high
economic returns. Improving infrastructure would help reduce existing regional disparities and
boost competitiveness, in particular for labor intensive and low value-added products such as
agriculture. The existing road infrastructure network is among the least developed in LAC,
hampering the tradable sectors of the economy, particularly exporters. Expanding and improving
the condition of main and access roads can lead to lower postharvest losses, lower cost of
transportation and better access to local and regional markets, especially for producers located in
rural areas. Investing in water storage and distribution infrastructure would also be critical, given
the uneven seasonal and geographical distribution of water and the importance of the agricultural
sector. Nicaragua has one of the highest electricity prices in LAC due to the country’s heavy

dependence on imported oil for power generation and technical losses in the system. This has
important macroeconomic implications for the external accounts if oil prices rise in the future.

18.     Addressing disparities in access to basic services among the rural population can
break the cycle of intergenerational transmission of poverty. While access to basic services
has improved over time, it remains far from universal: roughly six out of ten households did not
have access to running water, four out of ten households lacked access to sanitation services, and
two out of ten households did not have access to electricity in 2014. The problem becomes more
acute among those in the lowest quintiles of the income distribution and among those living in
rural areas. Poor access to water and sanitation has resulted in increased environmental health
risks, especially for children under five, while lack of access to energy leads to higher health risks
as households tend to rely on solid fuels for cooking, resulting in acute respiratory infections and
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.

19.     However, a model based on factor accumulation alone will not be enough to lift a
significant share of the population out of poverty and absorb new entrants into the labor
market. Over the long run, Nicaragua will require higher growth rates to raise its per capita income
faster and make significant dents into poverty. Should Nicaragua be able to grow at 3.6 percent in
per capita terms (its average growth since 2010), it would still take 79 years in order to reach the
average GDP per capita of LAC. There are important interactions between factor accumulation
and productivity growth. For example, improvements in the provision of public infrastructure or
access to, and quality of, education can generate positive spillovers and be productivity enhancing.
While in practice the distinction between factor accumulation and improvements in productivity
are not that clear cut, for presentational purposes, this report separates these processes.

20.     To boost competitiveness and productivity, Nicaragua will have to: i) improve its
investment climate and firm level productivity; and ii) strengthen its institutions and
improve public sector efficiency. In terms of market competition, Nicaragua ranks at the bottom
of market dominance of the Global Competitiveness Index 2016–17 (135 out of 138). Barriers to
entrepreneurship are higher compared to other countries in LAC.10 Regulations that limit the entry
of competitors where competition is viable may reinforce market dominance in key service sectors.
High concentration of Nicaragua’s financial system may also exacerbate the lack of competition
and efficiency. In particular, expansion of credit for micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSMEs) can help employment creation with the sector employing around 1.5 million people.
Barriers to external trade also increase the cost of bringing Nicaraguan goods to international
markets, and border crossing times are among the highest in LAC. Nicaragua’s land-agriculture
productivity is the lowest among regional peers suggesting significant inefficiencies in the
allocation of resources and high returns to improvements in this area.

21.     Promoting better institutions and strengthening the capacity of the public sector
would improve public service delivery and promote efficiency. Nicaragua ranks in the bottom
third of the Worldwide Governance Indicators. Bureaucratic quality indicators suggest a need to
strengthen knowledge, capabilities, and systems for the civil service, including informing the
public of the collection and use of public resources in delivering government services. This process
requires reducing the concentration of decision making and empowering civil servants. Failing to

disentangle technical decisions from political forces may lead to inaction or failed implementation,
as continuously ensuring political loyalty can affect the speed and ability to take and implement
decisions throughout the administrative chain. One identified need is to foster broad-based debate
and evidence-based policy making. Using impact evaluations for selected programs and
strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems could lead to better development outcomes.
Although systematic administrative data is collected in every line ministry and agency, these are
rarely effectively used to adapt and adjust policies and programs, due in part to weak capacity and
over-centralization of key decision-making.11

22.     Improvements in agriculture productivity will require both continued effort in
improving land administration, including securing property rights, and agriculture
intensification. In terms of registering property, Nicaragua ranks poorly (146th) in the Doing
Business report. The quality of land administration is low (index of 6.5 on a scale of 0–30). An
estimated 35 to 40 percent of all land in Nicaragua faces some type of dispute or conflict. Several
studies have found a positive relationship between the receipt of a registered title, land value and
investment. To address these issues, the government of Nicaragua, with support of the donor
community, has already made important strides in strengthening the land administration
framework. Investments in research as well as extension services are also needed to increase
agricultural intensification. Moreover, thinking of the agricultural value chain as a whole, logistics
has an important impact on productivity of the sector.

1.5. Risks: sustaining the gains achieved in poverty reduction and shared prosperity
23.     There are three main risks for Nicaragua’s development going forward . These are:
i) Nicaragua’s large external vulnerabilities; ii) the financial position of social security, the
National Security Institute (INSS); and iii) the vulnerability of the country to climate shocks and
natural disasters, and its management of natural resources.

24.     Reducing the country’s external vulnerabilities arising from the financing of large
current account deficits remains one of the key priorities. Nicaragua has been running large
current account deficits, driven in part by a sizable oil import bill. These deficits have been
financed by foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and the oil collaboration agreement signed with
Venezuela under the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) since 2007. But
since 2015, financing from the oil cooperation has been on the decline due to the progressive
deterioration of Venezuela’s economy and finances. Lower oil prices in recent years have
temporarily reduced pressures on the external side. In order to mitigate external shocks stemming
from oil price increases, Nicaragua has to continue to move toward a more diversified energy
matrix. This would also help improve fiscal and external sustainability by containing government
subsidies and lowering volatility of tariffs arising from the volatility of oil prices. In addition,
improvements in the competitiveness in the tradable sector would help narrow the trade balance.

25.     Improving the financial position of INSS as well as the coverage of the system is
crucial from both a fiscal and social standpoint. The INSS provides benefits for old age,
disability, illness, death, maternity, and occupational risk. Nicaragua has both noncontributory and
contributory pension regimes. The contributory general regime works as a pay-as-you-go system,
financed by contributions of employers and employees. Since 2013, the INSS has been running
11
     IMF, 2015 Article IV Consultation.

                                                  7
increasingly larger deficits (about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2016) and the replacement rate of the
contributory system is high. Limited coverage of the labor force due to high levels of informality
in labor markets and ongoing changes in demographic trends pose important challenges. Only 29.2
percent of the total employed population was covered by social security in 2016. Moreover, the
ratio of employees contributing to the system for pensioners has been on the decline: 4.4 employees
were supporting a pensioner in 2016, down from 5.7 in 2008. Demographic changes are expected
to further strain INSS’ finances, which if left unaddressed, could potentially result in a drain of
fiscal resources. These changes would result in a decline in education expenditures and an increase
in health care spending, in addition to the largest projected increase related to pension
expenditures, with increases in social security contributions only partially offsetting these.

26.     Reducing vulnerability to climate shocks and natural disasters and improving
management of natural resources are critical for development in Nicaragua. The country’s
high concentration of poverty in rural areas (especially along the Dry Corridor), rapid and
unplanned urbanization, and the importance of the agricultural sector highlight the critical need
for adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce the vulnerability of the country to climate change
and natural disasters. Nicaragua is highly exposed to natural hazards, including hurricanes and
tropical storms, droughts, seismic and volcanic activity. Extreme weather events and seismic
activity have caused serious long-term damage to human and physical capital. This high
vulnerability is exacerbated by mismanagement of natural resources. Water resources are abundant
in Nicaragua, yet spatial and seasonal disparities, limited availability of storage infrastructure, and
pollution have resulted in a fragile water balance in many regions of the country. Deforestation
and unsustainable farming production systems and land-use practices have increased the risk of
drought over the last decades, contributing to land degradation and erosion, impairing soil retention
capacity and exacerbating the damage caused by extreme precipitation events and storms.

1.6. Priority areas
27.     In taking stock of progress and reflecting on constraints and opportunities that
Nicaragua faces on its path of shared prosperity and poverty reduction, this Systematic
Country Diagnostic (SCD) identifies a number of priority areas. The analysis of the
development challenges in any country, including Nicaragua, will likely find that there is space
for improvement on most areas fundamental for development. And yet, a long list of
recommendations is likely to be of limited use. Policy makers face budgetary and political
economy constraints that limit their ability to take action. Thus, an effort to prioritize among
competing policy interventions can add significant value to any diagnostic of country development
challenges. Exploiting a diverse set of analytic tools, a benchmarking exercise and country
knowledge, the SCD also contributes to Nicaragua’s policy debate by identifying a selective list
of priorities and opportunities.

28.     As a result, this SCD has identified five priority areas and one cross-cutting theme.
These are: (i) improvements in education, skills, and job outcomes for the youth; (ii) provision of
infrastructure (transport, energy, and water) and public service delivery; (iii) enhancements in
private sector productivity and investment climate; (iv) reduction of vulnerabilities from climate
change, natural disasters and better management of natural resources (water, forestry, and land);
and (v) decrease in external vulnerabilities. The cross-cutting theme is strengthening institutions
and the capacity of the public sector. While areas (i)–(iii) refer to changes that can have positive

                                                  8
impacts on growth and the twin goals, areas (iv) and (v) are critical for the sustainability of the
growth path, which are needed to avoid any negative externalities and consequences associated
with the selected path. Finally, the cross-cutting theme is crucial to enable progress in all five
identified priority areas.

29.     Going beyond the broad priority areas, the SCD provides a set of policy actions that
have been identified within those areas as opportunities to generate advances. The SCD
identifies the most critical actions or policies within these priority areas that represent opportunities
for Nicaragua to continue making progress on shared prosperity and extreme poverty reduction.
To hone in on those opportunities with the greatest potential impact, a series of filters or criteria
were applied during consultations with World Bank Group staff and stakeholders in Nicaragua.
This list of policy actions and/or opportunities can serve as a starting point for deeper analysis and
discussion going forward and are presented in Annex 1.

1.7. Knowledge gaps
30.     In the process of reviewing, analyzing, and synthesizing existing data and research on
Nicaragua, a series of knowledge and data gaps were discovered that, if addressed, would
help better inform the decision-making process. The SCD has made use of existing research,
new analysis, and consultations within and outside the World Bank Group and stakeholders in
Nicaragua. As such, the report identified several knowledge and data gaps in the existing literature.
Addressing these gaps would provide additional information to design crucial policy interventions
in many key priority areas identified in this document. Gaps identified in this SCD include:
 What is the poverty rate at a higher level of geographical disaggregation? Household
    surveys are not usually representative at a high level of geographical disaggregation. In
    Nicaragua, the Living Standards Measurement Studies survey (Encuesta Nacional de Hogares
    sobre Medición de Nivel de Vida, EMNV) is representative only at the level of four regions
    (Central, Caribbean, Pacific, and Managua). A higher level of geographical disaggregation
    would allow measuring poverty in specific areas (e.g., municipalities that are located in the
    Dry Corridor). The latest census data (and poverty map) was collected in 2005. Therefore, new
    census data is urgently needed in order to estimate poverty at a higher level of geographical
    disaggregation. Other data issues include frequency of data collection, availability to the
    general public and comparability across time. For instance, the EMNV is currently collected
    by the Statistical Office every four to five years. Annex 2 lists data gaps identified in the SCD.
 What are productivity developments at the firm level? This report shows a shift in structural
    change from agriculture to services that seems to have had a limited contribution to
    productivity gains. However, this analysis relied mainly on household surveys and national
    accounts series. In order to better understand firms and labor market dynamics, more
    specialized surveys are needed. The latest firm level data is from the 2010 Enterprise Surveys.
    Labor force surveys are conducted in the country, yet these were not readily available to
    conduct this analysis.
 What is the causal impact of remittances on well-being? Migration has grown considerably
    over the past 25 years and remittances have contributed to some extent to improving the
    welfare of the less well-off. Simulations show that overall poverty would have been 15 percent
    higher when excluding remittances from abroad. Therefore, it is crucial to measure the causal
    impact of migration and remittances on poverty, income inequality, and human capital.


                                                   9
   What is the causal impact of social assistance programs on poverty? To the best of our
    knowledge, no rigorous analysis has analyzed the causal impact of social assistance programs
    on poverty in Nicaragua. Simulations show that these programs had a modest impact on
    poverty, since they generally have low benefits and are insufficiently targeted. Understanding
    the mechanisms through which social assistance programs decrease both poverty and
    inequality is crucial for improving the design of these programs.
   What are the main constraints to women entering the labor force? Nicaragua ranks among
    the countries with the lowest female labor force participation. Given the importance of women
    participation in the labor force for poverty reduction and economic growth, it is crucial to fully
    understand the main drivers of low female labor force participation in the country.
   What are the potential implications of the recent tax reforms (Ley de Concertación
    Tributaria and subsequent changes) in terms of tax expenditures? A study by Pecho et al
    (2012) estimated that tax expenditures in Nicaragua amounted to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2010,
    88 percent of which corresponded to Value-Added Tax exonerations and exemptions.
    According to this study, Nicaragua had the second highest level of tax expenditures in LAC
    (second only to Guatemala). Nicaragua has undertaken a series of tax reforms, however,
    changes to the tax code in 2014 backtracked some of the reductions in tax exemptions and
    exonerations envisaged in the 2012 tax reform.

1.8. Structure of the report
31.     The report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 provides an analysis of poverty, inequality,
and shared prosperity dynamics and identifies the drivers behind them. Chapter 3 examines growth
dynamics and provides a better understanding of the growth structure and the structural
transformation of the economy. It also looks at potential sources of growth in the future and the
constraints that would need to lifted to unleash higher and sustained broad-based growth. Chapter
4 analyzes factors behind inclusion, inequality, and shared prosperity. Chapter 5 addresses
sustainability. The last chapter describes the prioritization process.

2. POVERTY AND SHARED PROSPERITY
After many years of stagnant poverty, Nicaragua’s poverty reduction has accelerated in the last
decade, mainly due to a growth of earnings in the agricultural sector. However, poverty remains
among the highest in LAC and many Nicaraguans still fell into poverty during the 2005–2014
period. The country’s exposure to climatic hazards and climate change poses additional
challenges for preventing individuals from falling into poverty since the largest economic group
is made up of Nicaraguans who are not poor but who are at risk of falling into poverty if hit by
shocks—i.e., the vulnerable.

2.1. Poverty has declined in recent years
1.      In contrast to stagnant poverty until 2005, poverty reduction has accelerated in the
last ten years. Nicaragua’s official extreme poverty rate remained stagnant at about 17 percent
between 1998 and 2005 (Figure 2.1, panel a). Since then, poverty was reduced to 8 percent in
2014. Similarly, official overall poverty remained stagnant at about 48 percent between 1998 and
2005, but was reduced to about 30 percent in 2014 (Figure 2.1, panel b).12 Although reductions in
poverty were observed both in urban and rural areas, more progress has been made in rural areas
(see Box 2.1 for definitions).

2.      Income-based poverty also decreased during the last decade and followed a similar
trend to LAC as a whole. The internationally comparable income poverty rate—defined in LAC
as the proportion of individuals with an income lower than USD 4 per day in 2005 PPP—decreased
by 18 percentage points (or 33 percent) between 2005 and 2014 (Figure 2.2, panel b). There was
an increase in incomes that contributed to upward economic mobility: almost half of the initial
poor in 2005 moved out of poverty by 2014. The reduction in poverty is comparable to the one
observed in LAC as a whole, where income-based poverty steadily fell by 14 percentage points
(or 38 percent) between both years. A similar trend is observed in terms of extreme income
poverty—defined as having an income of less than USD 2.5/day—which decreased by 15

     In 2014, the extreme and overall poverty lines were USD 1.87 and USD 3.02 per person per day at 2005 PPP.

percentage points in Nicaragua (or 48 percent) between 2005 and 2014 (Figure 2.2, panel a),
comparable to the fall of 10 percentage points in LAC (or 49 percent). Both extreme and overall
poverty reduction were more pronounced in Nicaragua than in Central America as a whole.

                                                       Box 2.1: Poverty measurement in Nicaragua
Official extreme and overall poverty estimates in Nicaragua are produced by the National Statistical
Institute (Instituto Nacional de Información de Desarrollo, INIDE) based on EMNV data for 1998, 2001,
2005, 2009, and 2014. Nicaragua estimates poverty based on the Cost of Basic Needs method by fixing an
absolute extreme poverty line of USD 1.87 and an overall poverty line of USD 3.02 per person per year in
2014 (both in 2005 PPPs). This poverty line is considered to represent a level of per capita consumption
required to access a basket of goods and services needed to achieve adequate living conditions. The most
recent official poverty numbers in Nicaragua are from 2014, when the extreme and overall official poverty
rates at the national level were 8.3 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively. The SCD relies on INIDE’s
official consumption aggregate to measure official country-specific poverty rates. However, the welfare
measure used for comparison purposes is income per capita, which are derived from a regional data
harmonization effort known as SEDLAC, a joint effort of the World Bank Poverty and Equity Global
Practice and CEDLAS at the National University of La Plata in Argentina. This project aims to increase
cross-country comparability of selected findings from official household surveys. For this reason, official
income and consumption poverty statistics reported by governments and national statistical offices may
differ from those reported here for cross-country comparison purposes.
This chapter calculates regional aggregated indicators for LAC by pooling micro data from Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. To analyze the same set of countries
every year, interpolation was applied when country data were not readily available for a given year. With
the exception of figures 2.13 and 2.19, all others do not include Haiti due to lack of recent data. The
definition of economic groups, from Ferreira et al. (2012), is related to economic security: (i) the poor, who
are those individuals with a per capita income below USD 4 per person per day; (ii) the vulnerable, who
are at high risk of falling back into poverty and have incomes between USD 4-10 per person per day; (iii)
the middle class, who are those individuals living with incomes between USD 10-50 per person per day;
and (iv) the rich, who are those with incomes above USD 50 per person per day (all in 2005 USD PPP).

3.       The growth of incomes among lower income households is behind the decline of
poverty. The reduction in poverty before 2009 was the result of growth of incomes among the
bottom 40 percent of the distribution (Figure 2.3)—the World Bank indicator used to measure
shared prosperity. The data show that per capita household income grew at an annualized rate of
2.5 percent for this group between 2005 and 2009, outpacing the zero average income growth.
Furthermore, from 2009 and 2014, Nicaragua experienced a higher income expansion among the
bottom 40 percent (5.2 percent). However, growth became less pro-poor as growth at the bottom
40 percent of the distribution was lower than the overall income growth between 2009 and 2014.
Still, average incomes of the bottom 40 percent grew faster than their counterparts in the other five
Central American countries. Despite significant income growth, most individuals in the lower 40
percent of the income distribution in general continued being poor in 2014 with an average income
of USD 2.73 per person per day, around 23 percent lower than any one of their counterparts in
LAC, and one-fourth of the income of Nicaraguans in the top 60 percent of the income distribution.

4.     Worryingly, income inequality increased slightly in the last five years, which stands
out as a risk going forward. The Gini coefficient, which is a standard indicator used to measure
inequality, decreased from 0.49 to 0.44 between 2005 and 2009 (Figure 2.4). This reduction was
more pronounced than the one observed in LAC as a whole, where inequality declined from 0.55

continued falling—though at a slower pace—in the LAC region.

5.      Growing inequality stems from higher income growth among those who are better-
off. The growth incidence curve (GIC), which shows per capita income growth by deciles of the
income distribution, confirms that growth was more pro-poor before 2009 (Figure 2.5). Income
growth was positive at the lower end of the income distribution, while it was negative for those at
the top. This pro-poor growth was a key factor behind the fall of inequality between 2005 and
2009. However, the growth pattern changed after 2009. Even when income growth continued
being positive at the lower end of the income distribution, it switched from negative to positive
among the better off, which contributed to the increment of income inequality between 2009 and
2014. Chapter 4 analyzes in more detail the role that certain external and internal factors and policy
tools played on these observed income inequality levels and trends.

6.      What are the main forces behind the poverty reduction of the last ten years? To
analyze why poverty has decreased we rely on two decomposition exercises: (i) one that sheds
light on the relative contribution of labor and nonlabor incomes to poverty and growth along the
per capita income distribution; and (ii) another one that helps in understanding the relative
contribution of household income growth and changes in the income distribution to explain
changes in poverty.

Decomposition of poverty changes (Barros et al. 2006; Azevedo, Inchauste, and Sanfelice 2013).

7.     Labor incomes have contributed the most to poverty reduction. Considering that labor
incomes represented 72 percent of total incomes at the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution
in 2005, changes in labor incomes are likely to have an impact on poverty and inequality reduction.

Since 2005, labor income has been the main force behind income growth among those below the
poverty line. Overall, higher labor incomes contributed to two-thirds of the poverty reduction
between 2005 and 2014 (Figure 2.6, panel b).13

 Source: Own elaboration based on SEDLAC data (CEDLAS and the World Bank). Note: The figure shows the
 Ravallion and Huppi (1991) sectoral decomposition of poverty changes. The intra-sectoral effect represents the
 contribution of poverty changes within sectors of the economy, controlling for each sector’ s initial population
 shares. The population shift effect represents the amount of the original poverty change attributed to population
 movements from one sector to another. The interaction effect arises from the correlation between both changes.
 Agriculture includes agriculture, hunting and forestry, fishing, and mining and quarrying. Industry includes the
 manufacturing sector and construction. Services include electricity; gas and water supply; wholesale and retail
 trade; hotels and restaurants; transport; storage and communications; financial intermediation; real estate, renting
 and business activities; public administration and defense; education; health and social work; other community,
 social & personal services; activities of private households as employers; extraterritorial organizations; and bodies.

8.      Nicaragua’s poverty reduction derives from higher earnings in the agricultural
sector. A decomposition of the contribution of every sector in the economy to poverty reduction
reveals that the increase in earnings in agriculture, together with the fact that most of the poor are
employed in this sector,14 explains much of the decline in rural poverty in the country between
2005 and 2014. The incremental change in incomes in agriculture accounts for about 50 percent
of total poverty reduction at the national level and almost 80 percent in rural areas of the country
(Figure 2.7). That contribution responds mainly to increases in labor earnings rather than more
employment (Figure 2.6, panel b). The population shift between sectors explains less than 3
percent of poverty reduction between both years in rural areas, consistent with the low mobility
across sectors. The increase in world commodity prices for agricultural products has likely played
an important role in the rise of earnings of the poorest segments of the agricultural sector and
reduction of poverty in rural areas.15 However, a cautionary note regarding the sustainability of
13
   Labor income also contributed to about 80 percent of inequality reduction between 2005 and 2009. This contribution
was higher than for LAC, where labor income contributed to a reduction of 54 percent in inequality (Cord et al. 2016).
14
   About 50 percent of the total poor obtained their incomes from the primary sector in 2005, compared to 22 percent
of the nonpoor population, and that sectoral composition remained fairly constant over the years.
15
   A similar situation already happened in the past. Despite declines in productivity in agriculture, wages and
employment in the sector increased between 2001 and 2005. This increment in wages was the result of higher
agricultural terms of trade faced by farmers in rural areas (World Bank 2008, 2013, 2016; FIDEG 2015).

                                                                 16
price increments and the fragility of the gains in poverty reduction: while higher food prices have
likely favored earnings in agriculture in rural areas and poverty reduction, this could pose a risk if
prices decelerate in the years to come. In urban areas on the other hand, poverty reduction was
more evenly distributed, although the increase in earnings in services played a more prominent
role explaining about 55 percent of poverty reduction.

9.      Nonlabor incomes played an increasingly more important role among the poorest
deciles of the income distribution. Approximately one-third of the growth of incomes of the less
well off in the last five years can be explained by nonlabor incomes. Overall, nonlabor incomes
contributed to less than one-fourth of overall poverty reduction between 2005 and 2014 (Figure
2.6, panel b). As such, the rest of this section discusses the role that some sources of nonlabor
income played in alleviating poverty: (i) migration and remittances; (ii) social protection
programs; and (iii) the demographic composition of the population.

10.     Migration grew considerably over the past 25 years. As of 2015, more than half a
million individuals have migrated from Nicaragua. About 45 percent of those migrants moved to
Costa Rica, while another 40 percent migrated to the US. Most migrants were males, aged 25 –40
years old, and from the Pacific and Central regions. The main motivation for migration was to
pursue employment opportunities: about 85 percent of those who lived abroad migrated due to
work and/or economic reasons. Men tend to migrate in order to work in agriculture, forestry, and
fishery, while women tend to work as maids and domestic help.16 In addition, returns to skills in
Nicaragua are lower than in many other LAC countries. Therefore, more and better education
might need to be translated into better paying jobs and higher returns to education abroad.17 As a
result of this, migrants tend to be more educated than the rest of the population: in 2014, over 50
percent of those living abroad had completed secondary education. However, skills levels differ
across countries of destination. The US, Spain, and Panama are the preferred destination among
relatively skilled migrants, while Costa Rica, the rest of Central America, and Mexico for the less
skilled. About half of those who migrated to Costa Rica have completed secondary education,
compared to over 80 percent of those who migrated to Panama, the US, and Spain.

11.     Remittances contributed to some extent to improving the welfare of the less well off.
Remittance inflows have considerably increased since the mid-nineties from about USD 75 million
(1.8 percent of GDP) in 1995 to about USD 1.1 billion (9.7 percent of the GDP) in 2014.18 The
share of those who received remittances and were poor remained fairly constant since 2005 (Figure
2.8, panel b). Nevertheless, remittances have become more important among the poorest
households in the last ten years: in 2014, they represented about 20 percent of household income
of recipient families in the lowest decile, up from 10 percent in 2005 (Figure 2.8, panel a). Overall,
remittances had an impact on poverty: in 2014, general and extreme poverty would have been
about 10 percent and 15 percent higher without remittances, respectively.19

   More than half of remittances in 2016 originated in the US, while about 20 percent came from Costa Rica.
19
   Fajnzylber and López (2008) also found that remittances relaxed budget constraints and affected household
behavior, leading to better school enrollment for children 12–17 years old and health outcomes in Nicaragua.

                             Knowledge Gap: What is the causal impact of remittances on well-being?

 According to the analysis in this section, remittances might have improved individuals’ well-being, given
 that overall poverty would have been 15 percent higher when excluding remittances from abroad.
 However, these results are based on simulations and it is crucial to measure the causal impact of
 migration and remittances on poverty, income inequality, and human capital.

12.     Nicaragua has expanded the coverage of its social assistance programs, though they
are generally small and insufficiently targeted, limiting their impact on poverty. Unlike most
LAC countries, Nicaragua does not have a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT). However, it currently
has about 46 social assistance programs whose beneficiaries are mainly children, women, the
elderly, and disabled.20 As described in Chapter 4, most of these programs have low benefits and
are insufficiently targeted. There is no evidence of the effect of these programs on welfare as there
is no impact evaluation. However, simulations show that these programs had a modest impact on
poverty (Figure 2.9). Among beneficiaries, Programa Amor is associated with a poverty reduction
of 4.5 percentage points, while the rest of the programs by about 2 percentage points, with the
exception of Mochila Escolar that does not have any impact. A study by FUNIDES (2017) finds
that social programs altogether decreased overall income poverty by about 10 percent in 2014,
driven mainly by educational social programs (i.e., Vaso de leche, Merienda escolar, Mochila
escolar, zapatos escolares, Uniformes escolares, and Materiales didacticos).21

        Knowledge Gap: What is the causal impact of social assistance programs on poverty?

 Results presented in Figure 2.9 are simulations, as they are not based on an experimental design. To the
 best of our knowledge, no analysis has produced a rigorous impact evaluation in order to fully capture
 the causal impact of these programs on poverty in Nicaragua. Understanding the drivers through which
 programs reduce poverty and inequality is key for improving the design of these programs and increasing
 their desirability by proving their effectiveness in improving the life of the less fortunate (World Bank
 2016).

13.     The demographic composition of the population changed in Nicaragua, with a larger
share of working age population (aged 15-64), contributing to the reduction in poverty. With
roughly half of its population being 25 years old or younger and almost a third being under 14 in
2013 (down from 65 percent and 21 percent in 2003, respectively) and a median age of 23 years
(the fourth lowest in the region and among the 26 percent lowest in the world), Nicaragua’s
population is strikingly young. Moreover, fertility rates in Nicaragua more than halved in the last
55 years (Figure 2.10, panel a). The demographic transition experienced by Nicaragua has already
been reflected in a decreasing dependency ratio, defined as the ratio of dependents (individuals
younger than 15 or older than 64) to the working-age population, a measure of pressure on the
productive population (Figure 2.10, panel b). The dependency ratio almost halved in the last 25
years. Nicaragua moved from having among the highest dependency ratios in the region after
Paraguay and Dominican Republic in 1960 to having a ratio of dependents to the working-age
population equal to the regional average in 2014. Apart from its direct impact on economic growth
as described in Chapter 3, a lower dependency ratio also implies that every working-age adult now
has to take care of fewer young dependents, which is likely to end up having a direct impact on
reducing poverty rates through an improvement in per capita household income. As such, the lower
dependency ratio was associated with a 12 percent reduction of the overall poverty between 2005
and 2014 (Figure 2.6, panel b).

14.     Economic growth was also key for poverty reduction in recent years. Between 2005
and 2009, a one percent increase in GDP per capita was associated with a 1.7 percent reduction in
overall income poverty. In other words, growth-poverty elasticity was –1.7 in Nicaragua.22 This
is an improvement with respect to the past: growth-poverty elasticity was –0.4 between 1993 and
2005.23 Income poverty remained equally responsive to economic growth in the 2009–2014 period
(Figure 2.11). This elasticity was higher than in many other Central American and LAC
countries—aggregate growth-poverty elasticities were –0.2 and –1.7 between both years,
respectively.

15.     Yet, changes in the income distribution have recently decreased the contribution of
growth to poverty reduction. A decomposition analysis helps to understand the relative
contribution of household income growth and income inequality to changes in poverty. Between
2005 and 2009, overall income poverty decreased by 4 percentage points driven mainly by a
reduction of income inequality (see Figure 2.12, panel a): poverty would have increased slightly
if inequality had not decreased. The situation was reversed after 2009 when poverty reduction was
mainly driven by economic growth. If income inequality had not increased, poverty would have
decreased an additional 1.6 percentage points between 2009 and 2014. This contrasts with results

in LAC where both income growth and inequality reduction contributed to the decline of poverty
over the last decade (Figure 2.12, panel b).

2.2. Poverty remains high
16.    Despite recent social gains, the proportion of people living in poverty remains high.
Although poverty has fallen in recent years, roughly one-third of the population (about 1.7 million
Nicaraguans) still lived with a per capita consumption below the overall official poverty line in
2014 (Figure 2.1). Poverty is highly concentrated in rural areas: about half of rural Nicaraguans
were considered moderate poor that year, compared with about 15 percent of the urban population.
Of the 1.7 million poor, 1.2 million (about 70 percent) were living in rural areas.

                                  Box 2.2: Indigenous people in Nicaragua

There is no recent census or household survey that reflects the indigenous population, with the latest from
2005. Nicaragua’s indigenous population was relatively low that year, with 6 percent of total population
(311,700 people) self-identifying as indigenous. As such, the proportion of indigenous people in Nicaragua
was significantly lower than other LAC countries, including Bolivia (41 percent in 2012), Guatemala (41
percent in 2002), Peru (25 percent in 2007), Mexico (15 percent in 2010), Panama (12 percent in 2010),
Honduras (8 percent in 2013), and Ecuador (7 percent in 2010). Indigenous households in Nicaragua tend
to have lower access to basic opportunities and services compared to nonindigenous groups in the country
and to indigenous households in other LAC countries. According to the census, 39 percent of indigenous
households had access to piped water—the lowest access in LAC and significantly lower compared to 65
percent of the nonindigenous in Nicaragua. Indigenous access to sanitation (10 percent) was also the lowest
in LAC and significantly lower than nonindigenous groups in the country (26 percent). As for electricity,
only 50 percent of indigenous households had access in 2005, once again significantly lower than non-
indigenous groups (70 percent).

Interestingly, human capital accumulation and employment tended to be similar between indigenous and
nonindigenous groups. For instance, less than 64 percent of the indigenous had less than primary education
against 57 percent of the non-indigenous and literacy was 70 percent among indigenous against 75 among
non-indigenous. Similarly, about 57 percent of the indigenous were employed, compared to 59 of the
nonindigenous. However, there were marked differences in terms of the type of employment: for instance,
about 51 percent of the indigenous were employed in the primary sector compared to 34 percent of the
nonindigenous.

"Indigenous Latin America in the twenty-first century: the first decade" and on the LAC Equity LAB. Note: The
indigenous population was estimated using self-identification. Creoles and mestizos are not included as indigenous.

17.     As such, Nicaragua remains among the poorest countries in LAC. Nicaragua had the
fourth highest proportion of individuals living with incomes lower than the regional USD 4 per
day poverty line in 2014 (Figure 2.13), only to be surpassed by Guatemala (where poverty
increased from 55 percent in 2006 to 60 percent in 2014), Honduras (where poverty was 56 percent
in 2014), and Haiti (87 percent in 2012). On the other end, the poverty rate in Costa Rica—the
country with the lowest poverty rate of Central America—was 12 percent in 2014, about one
quarter of the poverty rate in Nicaragua.

18.     The country also ranks among the poorest countries based on nonmonetary poverty
measures. Poverty is a complex phenomenon as it is associated with many factors. To capture the
complexity of poverty, two recent studies24 use the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) from
Alkire and Foster (2011). The MPI includes a number of equally-weighted dimensions—e.g.,
health, education, living standards—captured by a number of attributes considered to be relevant—
e.g., lack of access to proper sanitation and drinking water. Individuals deprived of a certain
attributes are considered multidimensionally poor. According to Duryea and Robles (2016),
Nicaragua was one of the poorest countries in LAC in 2014 when considering the MPI: more than
60 percent of Nicaraguans were multidimensionally poor, with four or more privations that year.25

19.    Consistent with the high levels of poverty, Nicaragua’s middle class is one of the
smallest in the region. Higher incomes have contributed to the growth of the middle class—
defined as the proportion of individuals with an income between USD 10-50 per day in 2005
PPP—during the last ten years. This group expanded from 11 percent in 2005 to 18 percent in
2014 (Figure 2.14, panel a). However, the share of this group in the total population was one of
the lowest in 2014, being only larger than the middle class in Honduras and Guatemala (12 percent
and 9 percent, respectively, see Figure 2.14, panel b).

20.    The largest economic group consists of individuals who are not poor but remain at
risk of falling back into poverty if hit by shocks—i.e., “the vulnerable”. The vulnerable
group—those who have an income between USD 4 and USD 10 per day in 2005 PPP—grew from
34 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2014. The country has one of the largest vulnerable populations
in LAC, ranking fourth in terms of vulnerability.

                                                    Box 2.3: Mobility into and out of poverty in LAC

In order to measure intra-generational income mobility between two periods, and in the absence of actual
longitudinal data covering long periods of time, an innovative technique developed by Dang, Lanjouw,
Louto, and McKenzie (2014) was used to construct synthetic panels using two rounds of cross-sectional
micro data. Lower and upper bound estimates of income were obtained as lower and upper limits of true
per capita income mobility. Cruces et al. (2015) performed a wide range of sensitivity analysis and stress
tests in Nicaragua (and two other LAC countries) and confirmed the validity of the technique. Dang and
Lanjouw (2014) improved this technique by obtaining point estimates based on a parametric approach. In
this analysis, results from Vakis et al. (2016) who applied this parametric approach to all LAC countries
between 2004 and 2012 were updated. To obtain income mobility estimates using two cross-sectional
surveys, a per capita income model was estimated in the first round using a specification that includes only
time-invariant covariates. Parameter estimates from the same model were estimated in the second round of
the data and then plugged into the same time-invariant regressors in the first round to obtain an estimate of
the (unobserved) second period’s income for the same households surveyed in the first round. See Vakis et
al. (2016) for more detailed information on the methodology.

21.    Despite recent poverty reduction, downward income mobility is particularly
worrying. Figure 2.15 presents the transition matrix of poverty status in Nicaragua and LAC for
the 2004–2014 period. The figure shows income mobility within generations by measuring

movements into and out of poverty in all LAC countries for which micro data is available.26 As
explained earlier, Nicaragua experienced notable upward economic mobility during the last
decade: almost half of the initial poor in 2005 (48 percent) rose out of poverty by 2014 (Figure
2.15, panel a).27 However, upward income mobility was lower in Nicaragua than in LAC as a
whole: upward mobility out of poverty was almost 10 percentage points below LAC (57 percent)
during the last ten years (Figure 2.15, panel b). Moreover, about one in six nonpoor Nicaraguans
fell into poverty during the 2005–2014 period, in contrast with just one in ten nonpoor in LAC
(Figure 2.16). This result suggests a high vulnerability of the Nicaraguan population to falling into
poverty. Indeed, as already noted, the largest economic group in Nicaragua are the vulnerable.

   Given lack of panel data following individuals over time, the analysis is based on the construction of “synthetic
panels” applying an innovative technique that allows the use of cross-sectional data in all LAC countries to define the
poverty status of a household in two moments in time. For a detailed explanation, see Box 2.2 and Dang et al. (2014).

   The percentage of the poor who left poverty is calculated as the ratio between the percentage of poor population in
the first period (the sum of the first row of each matrix) and the percentage of the poor who left poverty.

22.    Exposure to climatic shocks further exacerbates household vulnerability and poses
additional challenges for preventing individuals from falling into poverty. As highlighted in
Chapter 5, Nicaragua's geographical location makes it prone to high intensity climatic shocks.
Climatic shocks affect upward income mobility and tend to perpetuate poverty, which poses an
important challenge for Nicaragua given the size of its poor and vulnerable population. A recent
study shows that a drought in 1997–1998 and scarce rains in July 2004 increased the likelihood by
10 percent that poor households remain at the bottom of the distribution in Nicaragua.28 Exposure
to climate shocks can also have an impact on child development and perpetuate poverty across
generations through a reduction in human capital accumulation. For instance, children affected by
Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in 1998 were about 9 percentage points more likely to be
malnourished two years after the shock29 and child labor was more prevalent as a result of the
storm in rural areas of the country.

23.     While progress has been made in all regions in Nicaragua, substantial regional
disparities persist within the country. Regional disparities in official poverty rates were
significant in 2014 (Figure 2.17). Poverty reduction between 2009 and 2014 was observed in all
regions of the country. However, declines in poverty were higher in regions with lower initial
poverty rates between 2009 and 2014. In terms of concentration, about half of the poor lived in the
Central region and roughly a quarter lived in the Caribbean region in 2014, with the other 25
percent distributed between Managua and the Pacific region. This higher concentration of poverty
in certain regions has important implications for poverty reduction going forward. As explained in
Chapter 5, many departments of the Central region are located in the Dry Corridor and therefore
highly exposed to hydro-meteorological events. Consequently, natural hazards and climate change
could eventually intensify poverty conditions in this particular region.

therefore, more exposed to climatic shocks and natural disasters. Table 2.1 presents the

nonpoor households. The table shows that the poor were more likely to live in a male-headed
household, have lower levels of human capital, and live in larger families with higher dependency
ratios of younger children in 2014. In addition, there are marked differences in income-generating
capacity: the poor were more likely to work in the agricultural sector in rural areas, while the
nonpoor were working in retail and services, mostly in urban areas. As described in Chapter 5,
increasing climate variability, droughts, and excessive rains are expected to have greater impact in
the agricultural sector in rural areas by reducing productivity due to loss of crops, ultimately
exacerbating poverty and vulnerability in Nicaragua.

      Knowledge Gap: What is the poverty rate at a higher level of geographical disaggregation?

 The 2014 EMNV is representative only at the level of the four regions: Central, Caribbean, Pacific, and
 Managua. Figure 2.17 shows that there exists a high poverty heterogeneity within Nicaragua. Therefore,
 it is crucial to estimate poverty measures at a higher level of geographical disaggregation to allow for
 measuring poverty in geographical domains—within representative regions—that are relevant for
 poverty diagnostic (e.g., municipalities in the Dry Corridor). Expanding evidence on interventions that
 decrease poverty and inequality requires a greater investment in filling data gaps and increasing its
 availability, improving data quality, and maintaining data comparability over time. The latest census
 data and poverty maps are from 2005. Therefore, new census data is urgently needed to estimate poverty
 at a higher level of geographical disaggregation. Annex 2 presents in more detail additional data gaps.

2.3. Poverty is lower than in countries with similar incomes
25.    Although it remains high, the poverty rate is lower than that of the poorest
neighboring countries. Despite being among the poorest countries in LAC according to income-
based poverty measures, Nicaragua’s poverty rate was significantly lower than the poorest
countries in Central America, namely Guatemala and Honduras (Figure 2.1). About 36 percent of
Nicaraguans were poor in 2014, a poverty rate more than 30 percent lower than in the other two
countries.

26.     A more egalitarian income distribution might explain why poverty is lower than in
other neighboring countries. Income inequality has negative consequences for poverty levels.
The poverty rate will increase each time a country moves from a given income distribution to a
more unequal one while preserving the same mean income. In other words, higher income
inequality will translate into a higher poverty rate for a given value of mean income.30 Figure 2.18
provides some evidence for LAC countries of the relationship between poverty and income (both
measured in 2005 PPP) at different levels of inequality in 2014. Two stylized facts emerge. First,
the figure shows a strong negative correlation between poverty and mean income: poverty is higher
at lower income levels.31 Second, inequality captured by the size of the circles32 has a negative
impact on poverty at a given mean per capita income: smaller circles (lower inequality) tend to be
concentrated below the regression line, while bigger circles (higher inequality) are on or above the
line with few exceptions.

compared with other LAC and Central American countries (Figures 2.18 and 2.19). Nicaragua’s
Gini coefficient is the second lowest of Central America, just after El Salvador and considerably
lower than LAC’s Gini. This relatively low inequality helps explain why the proportion of poor
Nicaraguans is lower than what could be expected for countries with similar development (namely
the regression line in Figure 2.18). The low level of inequality might also have played a key role
in the reduction of poverty observed in Nicaragua in recent years, since countries with lower initial
inequality are generally better able to translate economic growth into higher rates of poverty
reduction.33 Chapter 4 analyzes other potential factors that could have contributed to the relatively
low levels of income inequality in Nicaragua. It is worth clarifying that, despite having one of the
lowest Gini coefficient in LAC, at 0.47 the coefficient is hardly low by international standards, as
the country stands out as one of the most unequal in the world. A recent study shows that Nicaragua
is among the top 20 most economically unequal economies in the world out of 101 countries for
which inequality data are available.34

  According to World Bank (2016c), eight LAC countries are among the tenth most unequal in the world (Haiti,

most unequal economy in the world.

                      Box 2.4: How does poverty reduction in Nicaragua compare with other LAC countries?

Since the sustained poverty reduction of the last ten years is prone to questions, we compare it with other
official poverty changes in LAC since 1990. We find that the reduction of poverty in Nicaragua has been
lower than many other episodes of poverty reduction in the LAC region. About a third of all the annualized
official poverty reductions35 in LAC countries in the 1990s and 2000s are higher than the overall official
poverty reduction in Nicaragua between 2009 and 2014 (Figure B.2.4).36 For instance, overall poverty
decreased by more than six percentage points in El Salvador between 2012 and 2013 and by about four
percentage points (annualized) in Chile between 2011 and 2013. This means that the recent drop in the
poverty rate in Nicaragua is not an unusual event considering the distribution of poverty changes in the
region in the last 25 years.

3. GROWTH
Nicaragua has experienced a remarkable economic turnaround since 1994, resulting mainly from
three factors: i) improved macroeconomic management and debt relief; ii) reforms aiming at
transforming Nicaragua back into a market economy; and iii) demographic change that reduced
dependency ratios and increased the share of the working-age population. Over a longer period,
however, Nicaragua has not been able to keep pace with comparators on a per capita income
basis. So far, this economic turnaround has relied primarily on factor accumulation. To accelerate
growth over the medium-term, Nicaragua needs to make improvements in human capital which
will enable it to benefit fully from the ongoing demographic transition. Moreover, the country
needs to continue improving physical capital accumulation crowding in private sector activity and
reducing the large infrastructure gap (mainly through investment in the road network and the
electricity sector). However, a model based on factor accumulation alone will not be enough to
lift a significant share of the population out of poverty and absorb new entrants into the labor
market. Moving to a higher growth trajectory will require taking additional steps to enhance the
competitiveness of its economy. This will require improvements in institutions and reform to the
public sector to make it more efficient. It will also involve enhancing the investment climate and
business regulations and addressing challenges to lift the competitiveness of firms, including those
in the agricultural sector.

3.1. Introduction
1.       With a population of 6.1 million and a total area of 130,370 sq. km, Nicaragua is the
least densely populated nation in Central America. Population is heavily concentrated in the
Pacific and Central regions. About 30 percent of the population lived below the official poverty
line in 2014 and 8 percent was considered extremely poor. GDP and GNI per capita (Atlas method)
were USD 2,087 and USD 1,940 in 2015, only ahead of Haiti.

2.      Since mid-1990s, real output more than doubled, yet in a longer-term perspective,
Nicaragua has not been able to keep pace with comparators on a per capita income basis.
Annual real GDP growth averaged 4 percent, comparing favorably with LAC but trailing that of
lower middle income countries. However, GDP per capita contracted on average by –0.1 percent
over the last 50 years, contrasting with a 1.7 percent average annual increase in LAC. Putting it
differently, Nicaragua’s GDP per capita fell over the past 50 years, whereas it more than doubled
for LAC (Figure 3.1). Figure 3.2 shows Nicaragua’s performance vis-à-vis other countries that had
similar GDP per capita levels in 1977. In that year, Nicaragua had similar income to Guatemala
and the Dominican Republic in LAC, Mauritius in Africa, and Malaysia in Asia. As of 2015, the
country had the second lowest income in LAC, just above Haiti. Between 1977 and 2015,


                                                                                                                           32
Malaysia’s and Mauritius’ GDP per capita increased almost four-fold, and Dominican Republic’s
almost three-fold. In contrast, Nicaragua’s GDP per capita fell by 28 percent.

3.       Nicaragua’s income per capita has also diverged relative to advanced countries. In
1960, GDP per capita in Nicaragua was roughly $1,535 (in 2010 constant dollars) or one-eleventh
of that in the US (Figure 3.3). As of 2015, it was only 3.6 percent, showing a significant divergence
in relative per capita income. Moreover, today’s group of upper middle income countries had , on
average, a relative GDP per capita of 8 percent of that of the US. In the early 1960s, Nicaragua
had a higher standard of living than the average upper middle income country of 2015. By 2015,
on average Nicaragua trailed both upper middle income (14.7 percent) and lower middle income
countries (3.9 percent) in terms of relative income to the US. This places Nicaragua’s growth path
well below countries that had similar or lower income levels 50 years ago. The next section
provides a historical perspective to understand the developments that led to the observed
divergence of income per capita in the 1970s and 1980s.

3.2. A historical perspective to understand where the country stands today
4.      The Somozas ruled Nicaragua for over four decades until 1979 with growth that
mostly benefited the country’s elite. 37 Between 1950 and 1977, Nicaragua’s GDP per capita
doubled to USD 3,349, outpacing the rest of LAC.38 But the benefits of such growth failed to be
shared among the vast majority of the population as wealth and land ownership were concentrated
in a few hands, including the Somoza family.39 According to a World Bank Report of 1973, “the
benefits of Nicaragua’s substantial economic growth accrued to a small share of the population.
The distribution of agricultural land is extremely concentrated [. . .]. A few small groups control
most profitable industrial, financial and commercial ventures.”40 Land ownership concentration
increased from the 1950s through the early 1970s (Booth, 1991, Brockett, 1988), due to, among
other factors, government policies that favored agro-industries tied to the Somozas.41

5.     Social indicators of that period lagged behind LAC, impacting to some extent social
outcomes of today. In 1970, average life expectancy at birth was about 54 years, and under-five
mortality was the second highest in Central America. Primary education completion was just 25
percent, whereas almost 48 percent of primary school-age children were not enrolled in school
(Table 3.1). Over half of the population 25 years and older had no education attainment, and only
3.8 percent completed secondary education in 1970. With 2.7 years of schooling on average,
Nicaragua trailed both developing countries (3.2) and the regional average (4.1).42

   Following the assassination of Sandino in 1934, General Anastasio Somoza García took power in 1936 with the
support of the National Guard. The revolutionary triumph of the FSLN forced Anastasio Somoza Debayle, his younger
son, to flee the country in 1979.

   Nicaragua’s GDP per capita grew on average by 3.2 percent over 1961 –77 (WDI, 2016). Confiscations following
the victory of the Sandinista revolution provide a rough idea of the Somozas wealth: between 1,500—2,000 farms
covering an estimated 800,000—1,000,000 ha located in the Pacific region generally in the best crop and pastureland
(World Bank, 1981).

   Figures from the 1970 Agriculture Census indicate that large farms (larger than 350 ha) represented 1.4 percent of
the total number farms in the country, but accounted for 41.2 percent of total agricultural land. Small and medium
farms (less than 7 ha) represented 50.8 percent of total farms but less than 3.5 percent of total agricultural land.

6.      In 1972, an earthquake struck Managua, destroying most of the capital city and
leaving 6,000–8,000 dead and 20,000 injured. 43 In addition to the staggering human cost,
replacement costs of physical assets destroyed by the earthquake amounted to around 35 percent
of GDP in 1972. About 32,000 housing units (or 45 percent of the housing in Managua) were
destroyed and all of the central zone of the city was rendered unusable.44 Somoza assumed control
of the relief and reconstruction effort, but a significant portion of the international relief aid was
illegally appropriated, mismanaged and redirected to his family and members of the National
Guard.45 This, together with a number of other political pressures that were building, precipitated
and accelerated the fall of the Somoza regime.46

7.      The armed conflict in the 1970s that led to the fall of the Somoza regime was extremely
costly. Guerrilla actions by the FSLN took place throughout the 1960s and 1970s, with a final
offensive against the Somoza regime in 1979. Some figures place human casualties of the conflict
as high as 35,000 (Box 3.1). Serious damage was also inflicted on the country’s productive
capacity, with direct damage to physical structures, equipment and inventories estimated at about
12 percent of GDP. Capital flight prior to and during the peak of the conflict resulted in many
insolvent banks. The war also caused significant damage to many urban centers, in particular
Estelí, León, Masaya and Managua. The slaughter of cattle and smuggling of herds to neighboring
countries also impacted agricultural output for several years.47 By 1980, GDP had fallen by almost
30 percent over three years, whereas GDP per capita declined by 35 percent in real terms.

8.      The decade that followed was characterized by political strife and economic
mismanagement, build-up of massive macroeconomic imbalances, and a steady contraction
of real output. A five-member Government of National Reconstruction took over in 1979. The

   The assassination in 1978 of conservative opposition leader Pedro Joaquín Chamorro, editor and publisher of the
newspaper La Prensa, and the suspicion that Somoza and the National Guard were behind his assassination ended up
fracturing the already fragile support of business groups to the Somoza regime.

new Government embarked on emergency measures, including confiscation of land, commercial,
and industrial holdings of the Somoza family and its associates, and followed an extensive process
of public sector reorganization.48 Inadequate economic policies rendered market institutions weak,
trade controlled by state trading companies, a bankrupt domestic financial system, and
compromised property rights. This was compounded by adverse terms-of-trade and climate shocks
that resulted in large production losses. Civil unrest and armed conflict against the
counterrevolutionary movement (Contra War) also dominated the 1980s. Military spending to
respond to the contra-revolutionary insurgence and expansion of public spending in social areas
gave rise to major fiscal and external imbalances and the rapid accumulation of public external
debt (which reached 600 percent of GDP by 1990). Public sector deficits averaged 20 percent and
current account deficits over 30 percent of GDP between 1985 and 1990, while hyperinflation
reached around 10,205 percent in 1988.49

                                      Box 3.1: Conflict and Development

Nicaragua experienced two armed conflicts in the recent past. The conflict between the FSLN and the
Somoza government led to 10,000–35,000 deaths. Clodfelter (2002) presents the most detailed battle
information, with total deaths amounting to 10,000, of which at least 7,000 were civilians. Leitenberg
(2006) places the casualty estimate much higher at 35,000, with 25,000 civilian deaths. The civil war that
followed (Contra War) from 1981–1989 led to 10,000–43,000 fatalities. Clodfelter (2002) places the
number of deaths at over 30,000, whereas Brogan (1998) points to 10,000 casualties. The Correlates of War
database (Sarkees, 2000) suggests a much higher toll (greater than 43,000).

As the 2011 World Development Report (WDR) notes, the costs of violence are enormous for countries
and their citizens, both in terms of human suffering and social and economic consequences, with the most
vulnerable groups in society being frequently the most affected. On average, the 2011 WDR suggests that
a country experiencing major violence over a period (1981–2005) had a poverty rate 21 percentage points
higher than a country that saw no violence. The disruptive effect of violence on development and the
widening gap between countries affected by violence and those not affected are deeply troubling. Poverty
reduction in countries affected by major violence is on average nearly a percentage point slower per year
relative to countries not affected by these episodes (Keefer, 2012). After a few years of major violence, the
contrast can be quite stark: countries affected by violence throughout the 1980s lagged in poverty reduction
by 8 percentage points, and those that had experienced major violence throughout the 1980s and 1990s
lagged by 16 percentage points.

Economic costs are also immense. A major episode of violence can wipe out an entire generation of
economic progress. The average cost of civil war is equivalent to more than 30 years of GDP growth for a
medium size developing country. Moreover, trade levels take on average 20 years to recover after major
episodes of violence.

   A World Bank report of 1981 indicates that “Commercial banks and insurance companies were nationalized, and
new ministries were established to control some of the country’s domestic and foreign trade. Moreover, the
Government rapidly expanded the scope and coverage of social programs, particularly in the areas of education and
health. The new regime endorsed a mixed economy, in which the Government will be involved in a variety of directly
productive activities, and will closely regulate the economic process. The role of the State in ownership of productive
assets has been radically changed. In sum, 37 percent of the country’s GDP in 1980 was produced in state-controlled
institutions.” (Nicaragua: The Challenge of Reconstruction, The World Bank (1981), Report No. 3524-NI, page i.).

   Hyperinflation peaked in January 1989, when it reached 43,000 percent (Ocampo, 1991).

9.      When the newly elected democratic government took office in 1990, Nicaragua was
coming out of a decade-long economic stagnation. The Contra War left over 30,000 people dead,
a damaged stock of physical infrastructure, growing unmet needs of the population and a large gap
in the provision of basic services. By 1993, about half of Nicaraguans were living in poverty and
one-fifth in extreme poverty. Economic output was around 59 percent lower than prior to the
Sandinista revolution. In 1991–1992, the government of Barrios de Chamorro began implementing
a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilization program. With an IMF supported program, inflation
was brought down to single digits by the second half of 1991 and fiscal deficits were reduced by
two-thirds to 10 percent of GDP. The Government succeeded in clearing arrears with the World
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank and reached an agreement with Paris Club
creditors in 1991.50 The impact of the protracted civil war, large accumulated macroeconomic
imbalances, and unmet infrastructure and service delivery needs are still felt today.

3.3. Recent growth dynamics and analysis

Factors behind the rebound
10.     Since the country’s democratic transition in the early 1990s, Nicaragua has
experienced a remarkable economic turnaround. Real GDP growth averaged 4 percent whereas
GDP per capita grew by 2.5 percent per year. Between 1994 and 2015, GDP per capita grew by
71 percent in Nicaragua while it only expanded by 34 percent in LAC. However, progress has been
below that experienced (on average) by lower middle income countries, which doubled their GDP
per capita over the same period (Figure 3.4). Nicaragua’s growth has been particularly strong since
2009. Growth differences based on the best single break point in trend (1990–2015) point toward
growth acceleration post-2009 (Table 3.2). Despite steady growth, with the only contraction
occurring at the onset of the global financial crisis in 2009, GDP per capita remained some 28
percent lower in 2015 relative to 1977 levels.

11.     This economic turnaround resulted mainly from three factors. These include i)
improved macroeconomic management and debt relief; ii) reforms aiming at transforming
Nicaragua back into a market economy; and iii) demographic change. Part of the rebound could
also be attributed to the post-conflict recovery from a relatively low base. This was fostered by
good macroeconomic management and debt relief that created fiscal space for spending on
investment and social services. Moreover, the gradual normalization of production and economic
activity, rebuilding of physical capital, and ongoing demographic changes played an important
role. These issues are discussed in more detail below.

12.     Nicaragua’s economic management improved considerably over the past two
decades. The country maintained a strong commitment to macroeconomic stability and prudent
fiscal policies. The exchange rate policy has placed an emphasis on price stability and
predictability in a highly de facto dollarized economy. The preannounced rate of devaluation of 5
percent of the crawling peg regime has been unchanged since 2004. On the fiscal side, the
combined public sector deficit averaged 0.5 percent of GDP per year since 2006. Several tax
reforms have brought additional resources to the Government, helping finance the increase in
expenditures. Public investment has gradually increased over time as a percentage of GDP, from
4.1 percent in 2006 to 6.9 percent in 2015, starting to fill some of the gaps in public infrastructure.
On the structural side, the state’s participation in the economy has declined since the 1990s.

13.    Debt relief played a critical role in freeing up fiscal space for social and infrastructure
spending and supporting macroeconomic stability. Nicaragua reached completion point in
January 2004, and became eligible for debt relief under the MDRI in January 2006.51 Total debt
forgiveness in present value terms as of the Decision Point amounted to USD 3.3 billion under the
HIPC initiative, and assistance under HIPC and MDRI in nominal terms was USD 4.5 billion and
USD 1.9 billion, respectively. Overall public external debt went from 160.8 percent of GDP in
2003 to 46 percent of GDP by 2007. Since then, public external debt declined to 38.1 percent of

debt service payments and increase spending in other priority areas.52

14.    Demographic changes have also contributed to supporting this rebound in economic
growth. Declining fertility rates resulted in a reduction of the young dependency ratio and an
expansion of the share of the population of productive age (15–64) (Figure 3.6). The resulting
increase in labor supply contributed positively to faster growth and is expected to continue
supporting growth. Nicaragua’s working-age population increased almost threefold over the past
40 years (or by about 2.5 million persons). Today, 50 percent of the population is under 25 years
old.

Drivers of growth
15.     Consumption has been the main driver of growth in Nicaragua since the 2000s.
Household consumption has been supported by large remittance flows, which averaged roughly
9.7 percent of GDP since 2000. As of 2015, consumption share of output accounted for 95 percent
of GDP. 53 Investment, on the other hand, has been the most volatile component of aggregate
demand (Figure 3.7, panel a). In the period that followed the Global Financial Crisis (2010–15),
Nicaragua’s investment to GDP ratio averaged 29 percent of GDP, which is comparable to other
lower middle income countries and one of the highest in LAC (see Figure 3.7, panel b).54 Net
exports’ contribution to headline growth between 2010 and 2015 has been negative, as import
growth—fueled by a large oil import bill and strong consumption and investment spending—
outpaced export growth. The resulting large trade and current account deficits (22.5 percent and
9.7 percent of GDP over 2010–2015) highlight important vulnerabilities arising from the external
side and the need for measures to improve the country’s export competitiveness and reduce its
dependency from fossil fuel imports.

16.     Agriculture has been a key sector for the Nicaraguan economy. Agriculture, livestock,
forestry and fishing accounted for 17 percent of GDP, followed by trade, hotels and restaurants
(15.3 percent); personal, social and business services (14.3 percent); and manufacturing (13.3
percent) (Figure 3.8, panel a, 3.8, panel b). In spite of its declining relative weight over the past
two decades, agriculture continues to be a key sector for the Nicaraguan economy (Figure 3.9): the
sector still accounted for 15.8 percent of goods exports over 2010–2015, and employment in
agriculture comprised about 30 percent of total employment (about 764,000 persons) in 2014.55
This underscores the important role the sector can play uplifting both growth and exports, and
improving the livelihood of the majority of rural population.

   The export figure does not include agriculture related export products, such as beef (9.3 percent), sugar cane (3.8
percent) and cheese (2.1 percent). Employment in the agricultural sector is based on authors’ calculations with the
help of data from EMNV 2014.

FDI
17.     Nicaragua has some comparative advantages in attracting FDI, including a stable
macroeconomic situation, low labor costs, low crime and violence, and an abundance of land.
Since the 1990s, sound policies provided a prudent macroeconomic and fiscal environment.
Nicaragua’s labor costs are among the lowest in the region. As of 2017, Nicaragua’s minimum
wage in Special Economic Zones was the lowest in the Central America region. 56 In addition,
relative to its Northern Triangle neighbors, the country has low levels of crime and violence (Box
3.2). Experience in neighboring countries suggests that gang-related violence could undermine
investment decisions, influence cross-country FDI flows and have profound impacts on the

competitiveness of firms. Finally, Nicaragua, in relation to its population, has a relatively high
supply of land for development, particularly in the Atlantic region.57

     Box 3.2: Explaining Nicaragua’s low levels of violence relative to Northern Triangle neighbors
A distinctive characteristic of Nicaragua relative to its Northern Triangle neighbors is that the country has
maintained an environment low in crime and violence. With 11.5 homicides per 100,000, Nicaragua
exhibits much lower homicide rates than El Salvador (64.2), Guatemala (31.2), or Honduras (74.6)
(UNODC Statistics, 2016). Experience in neighboring countries suggests that gang-related violence could
impact the competitiveness of firms by elevating the costs of doing business through direct losses, extortion,
increased insurance costs, and diversion of resources to private security spending, potentially deterring
investment decisions. It also has profound social and economic impacts through the continuous outflow of
people facing the fear and threat of violent crime, representing a constant drain of labor and human capital.
A recent study for El Salvador (2016) places the costs of crime and violence at 16 percent of GDP in 2014.
Several factors may explain Nicaragua’s lower homicide rates compared to neighboring countries:
 Migratory patterns and settlement: During the Sandinista revolution and civil war that engulfed Nicaragua
  in the 1980s, many Nicaraguan migrants settled in Costa Rica and Florida. US census data show that only
  12 percent settled in Los Angeles, where they account for just 4 percent of Central Americans, while they
  represent 47 percent in Miami. Unlike the more ‘open’ gangs of Los Angeles, Miami’s local gang scene
  is dominated by highly exclusive African-American and Cuban-American gangs, which do not allow
  Nicaraguans (Rocha, 2006) (WDR, 2011). This may partly explain the lack of activity of cells of gangs,
  contrary to what has been seen in neighboring countries.
 Criminal deportations: Nicaragua exhibits very low deportation rates of convicted felons relative to its
  Northern Triangle neighbors. In 1996, the US Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and
  Immigrant Responsibility Act, whereby non-US citizens sentenced to one year or more in prison were to
  be repatriated to their countries of origin. Out of 287,125 Central American criminals deported from the
  US from 1999 to 2014, only 2.8 percent were Nicaraguan (Figure 3.11). This contrasts sharply with El
  Salvador (28 percent), Guatemala (33 percent) and Honduras (36 percent).
 Legacy of socialist structures that evolved from the Sandinista revolution: These include neighborhood
  watch organizations and FSLN structures, such as the Committees of Citizen Power which evolved from
  the Committees of Sandinista Defense. These structures, with more community involvement, may have
  blocked the establishment of gang-related activities. This form of social capital might also have acted as
  a containment for the youth, reducing risk factors into gang activity.
 Role of the national police: Community-based policing focused on prevention, and close collaboration
  with civil society have been the cornerstones of police crime and violence prevention. This is reflected in
  the perception of the police force in Nicaragua vis-à-vis the region. Latinobarómetro (2015) shows that
  satisfaction with the police is higher in Nicaragua (54 percent) than in El Salvador (36 percent), Guatemala
  (31 percent) and Honduras (43.4 percent).

18.     Nicaragua has benefited from solid FDI inflows, but the potential is even higher if it
can be harnessed. In 2015, FDI flows amounted to USD 835 million, or 6.6 percent of GDP
(second only to Panama, which received 9.7 percent of GDP).58 Services attracted the majority of
FDI flows (65.3 percent), followed by manufacturing (18.9 percent). Among specific subsectors,
the renewable energy and financial sectors were among the main destinations of FDI (Figure 3.10,
panel a, Figure 3.10, panel b). In October 2014, assets from Citibank in Nicaragua were bought by

   Nicaragua’s arable land per person (hectares per person) was 0.25 in 2014, higher than Costa Rica (0.05), Guatemala
(0.06), Honduras (0.13), El Salvador (0.12), and Panama (0.15). It was also higher than other lower middle income
countries (0.14) but lower than the average for LAC (0.29). (Source: WDI, 2016).

the Honduran financial group FICOHSA. The expiration of the Tariff Preference Level in 2015
likely negatively impacted FDI in the manufacturing sector, but was partly offset by continuing
investment in wire harnesses for automobiles (Yazaki), telecoms (Movistar and América Móvil)
and meat processing (Sukarne). A number of issues affecting FDI are discussed in different
sections of this chapter, such as shortcomings in infrastructure, transport logistics and trade
facilitation, the quality of labor supply to undertake technical and operational tasks, and investment
climate and business regulations, among other factors.

Key industries driving private sector growth59
19.      Coffee is one of the most important crops in Nicaragua. The sector generated 300,000
direct and indirect jobs. Coffee accounted for 9.2 percent of total goods exports over 2010–2015.
In the last five years, Nicaragua has been among the first 13 of 56 coffee producing countries.
According to the 2011 Agricultural Census,60 there were 44,519 coffee producers, accounting for
over 180,220 mz. The majority of farms are small (less than 20 mz), representing some 97 percent
of total producers and 58.9 percent of total cultivated area. Most of Nicaragua’s coffee production
is Arabica and is concentrated in the North Central Region’s municipalities of Jinotega, Matagalpa
and Las Segovias. Nicaragua has been less affected by El Niño, since the microclimate in the
mountainous regions provide most coffee plantations with steady rainfall. Coffee rust has also had
a lesser impact in Nicaragua than in neighboring countries.61

20.     The sugar industry remains one of the main subsectors in commercial agricultural
production in Nicaragua. The industry accounts for more than 135,000 jobs in the country (of
which 35,000 are direct jobs).62 Sugar exports represent around 5 percent of Nicaragua’s total
exports, and together with domestic consumption make up 3.1 percent of GDP.63 The majority of
domestic sugar production is covered by four main producers/sugar mills, which have had a strong
historical presence in the country.64 There are more than 800 independent sugarcane producers,
feeding into the national supply chain. Currently, Nicaraguan mills operate at a cost of around 16
cents per pound which compares favorably to global standards. In recent years, the Nicaraguan
sugar industry had experienced significant growth as a result of expansion of cultivated areas
(which have increased by 30 percent since 2011). One of the main drivers of the increase has been
the diversification of three of the four producers into bagasse for energy production. In 2015–2016,
half of the energy produced was used to power the sugar mills, with the rest fed into the national
grid. Around 7–10 percent of all electricity produced in the country is sourced from biomass.

21.      Production of beef and dairy products has traditionally been an important
component of the national economy. It is estimated that Nicaragua has approximately 120,000
cattle farmers, 70 percent of which are small (up to 35 heads of cattle) and medium producers (36–
100 heads).65 Most of them are small and geographically scattered. Use of the land is extensive as
feed is based mainly on native pastures. The vast majority of the cattle operations is based on a
dual purpose herd for the production of milk and beef. The livestock sector accounted for 9.4
percent of GDP in 2010–2015. In terms of exports, livestock and beef exports amounted to 9.9
percent of total goods exports, whereas dairy products exports averaged about 3 percent over
2010–15, jointly making up the country´s main export sector.

22.    Light manufacturing has become one of the most important industries in Nicaragua
over the past two decades, becoming a major source of employment and exports. The industry

accounts for 12.3 percent of GDP and around 40 percent of all exports. The industry has attracted
USD 62.2 million in FDI in 2016 (or over half of all FDI). The majority of the industry is focused
on apparel and footwear (USD 1.5 billion in exports) as well as wire harnesses for the automotive
industry (USD 580 million in exports). The industry has mostly grown over the past decade, taking
advantage of the economic free zones, as well as the Dominican Central America Free Trade
Agreement. The country is particularly appealing to manufacturers for its extremely low labor cost,
large labor force, proximity and duty free access to the US and Mexican markets.

23.    The tourism sector represents a significant source of employment and foreign
exchange. Nicaragua’s tourism industry generated USD 529 million in revenues in 2015 (or 21.8
percent of total exports) and supported 97,000 jobs directly. 66 The industry structure is highly
competitive with many large international chains, such as InterContinental Hilton, Wyndham and
Barceló operating business and leisure hotels, besides a sizable number of smaller domestic
operators. In 2015, 55 new investment projects were authorized under the Law of Investments for
the Tourism Industry in Nicaragua (Ley 306) for a total of USD 103 million.67

Factor accumulation has been the main driver of growth
24.      Growth accounting decompositions show that factor accumulation has been the
major driver of growth. The economic rebound has relied primarily on a growing labor supply
related to ongoing demographic changes and to a lesser extent, on capital accumulation. Labor
(adjusted by education) has been the strongest contributor to growth over the last 15 years.68 This
is in line with the decline in fertility rates and growth of the working-age population, together with
increasing female labor participation rates. Capital accumulation has played an increasing role
over time. However, infrastructure and access to basic service indicators and their international
comparisons point to a large infrastructure gap. The recent trend in TFP is promising: after either
negligible or negative contributions over 2000–2009, TFP made positive contributions to growth
over the last five years (Figure 3.12, panels a–d).

growth (1.3 percent) in 2001–2005, labor productivity declined to 0.6 percent in 2005–2009 to
later pick up pace in 2009–2014 (1.1 percent). Table 3.3 shows that labor productivity growth
measured as GDP per worker was very low over 2001–2014. Employment growth outpaced
working-age population growth, resulting in an increase in the employment rate. This suggests that
GDP per capita growth can be explained by both positive changes in the employment rate and
labor productivity growth, especially for the period between 2009 and 2014. However, labor
productivity growth still lags behind peers: it trails Panama and Costa Rica in Central America and
is behind the average for LAC and lower middle income countries.69 This suggests that there is
scope for further improvement.

   This is consistent with findings in World Bank (2013a) that labor (adjusted by education) contributed the most since
1980; however, the importance of both capital accumulation and TFP has increased in recent years.

26.     A sectoral disaggregation of labor productivity suggests that structural change and
sectoral allocation of resources had limited impact on productivity gains. Between 2001 and
2014, total employment share of agriculture declined by 1.4 percentage points. Services gained
about 2.0 percentage points in total employment share (Figure 3.13). While this observed structural
change—from agriculture to services—is not too different than that in other LAC countries, the
productivity gains along this process seem to be smaller than in other countries. In Nicaragua, the
service subsector that experienced the largest employment gain was trade, hotels and restaurants,
with a sectoral labor productivity well below the national average and only marginally better than
labor productivity in agriculture. One plausible explanation is the weak quality of education in
rural areas, which constrains workers moving from rural to urban areas to take on better, more
productive jobs.

                                                      Knowledge Gap: Productivity analysis and firm level data

 The analysis presented in this chapter has relied mainly on household surveys and national accounts
 series. In order to better understand firms and labor market dynamics, more specialized surveys are
 needed. The latest firm level data are from the 2010 Enterprise Surveys. Labor force surveys are
 conducted in the country, yet these were not readily available to conduct this analysis.

3.4. Potential sources of growth and its constraints
27.    GDP growth improved vastly over the past two decades, yet this performance was not
up to par vis-à-vis other lower middle income countries. This suggests that there is some
potential to be able to grow at a faster pace. It would take the country about 14 years—with GDP
per capita growing steadily at 2.5 percent per annum, the average per capita growth over 1994 –
2015—to surpass its GDP per capita of 1977. Should Nicaragua be able to grow at 3.6 percent in
per capita terms (its average growth since 2010), it would still take about a decade to surpass that

                                                                                                46
level. Since Nicaragua is growing faster than other lower middle income countries in Central
America, it will eventually catch up with them. However, back-of-the-envelope calculations show
that it would take 15 years to get to the GDP per capita level of Honduras, 25 years to that of
Guatemala, and 37 years to that of El Salvador. Moreover, it would take 79 years growing at
current rates to reach the average GDP per capita of LAC.70, 71

28.     Sustained, faster, and more inclusive growth is needed to make a significant dent to
the prevailing levels of poverty. In order to sustain its growth over the short and medium-term,
this section argues that Nicaragua can still rely primarily on factor accumulation. This requires
education to harness the most from the ongoing demographic transition as well as basic
infrastructure (road networks, electricity, and access to basic services) to foster private sector
activity and trade, and promote inclusion. Yet a model based on factor accumulation alone will not
be enough to lift a large share of the population from poverty and absorb new entrants into the
labor market. 72 In order to move into a faster growth trajectory, Nicaragua will also have to
enhance its competitiveness by strengthening the quality of institutions and the capacity of the
public sector for service delivery, improving the business environment and investment climate,
and increasing productivity and lifting constraints at the firm level.

3.4.1. Enhancing the process of factor accumulation

Labor and human capital
29.     Improving the overall education and skills of the population will be key to take full
advantage of the ongoing demographic transition. Nicaragua is entering into a window of
demographic opportunity.73 The change in the age structure of the population, from having a very
large share of a young population 0–15 years old to a larger share of working age population,74 has
already been supporting growth. Household surveys show that the employment rate has either
remained constant or increased from 60.2 percent in 2001 to 62.5 percent in 2005, 60.3 percent in
2009,75 and 64.2 percent in 2014. Even without considering changes in the employment rate, back-
to-the envelope calculations indicate that the labor supply effect has contributed about half of the
average increase in GDP per capita over 1990–2015 (or slightly less than one percentage point
increase over an annual increase of 1.9 percent in GDP per capita). Nicaragua’s window of
demographic opportunity is expected to remain open until 2045 (Figure 3.14). This demographic

   Calculations assume that El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras grow at 1.6 percent, 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent
respectively, their average GDP per capita growth over 2010 –2015. It is assumed that the average LAC GDP per
capita grows at 1.5 percent.

   The SCD makes a clear cut between the process of factor accumulation and improvements in productivity. In
practice, this distinction is not that clear. For instance, improvements in the provision of public infrastructure or access
to and quality of education can generate positive spillovers and be productivity enhancing.

30.     This effect can be further reinforced with increasing female labor force participation.
In fact, this has been gradually taking place as fertility rates have declined over time and more
females have been entering the labor market. In 2001, female labor force participation stood at
46.8 percent, and by 2014, it had increased to 50.7 percent. Moreover, in 2001, only 4.2 out of 10
females in the working-age population were employed. This ratio rose to 4.7 in 2014. While the
employment rate for females has also risen faster than for males over 2001 –14, this figure is still
much lower than that for men (at 8.3 out of 10). Narrowing this large gender gap can be another
opportunity to further increase the supply of labor.

31.     As the dependency ratio falls and labor supply rises, Nicaragua faces a unique
opportunity, if properly harnessed. 78 To take full advantage of its demographics, Nicaragua
needs to generate enough good quality jobs to absorb the emerging workforce, by addressing the
multiple constraints to private sector activity analyzed later in this chapter. It is also crucial to
improve education access and quality, and create a supply of human capital suited to the needs of
an expanding modern sector.79 Policies are also needed to provide labor market opportunities for
young entrants, especially those from low-income households. Failing to do so could have long-
lasting adverse effects on Nicaragua’s development prospects.

32.    The high level of dropouts, especially in lower secondary school, likely reflects a lack
of job opportunities for secondary graduates. Since 2008, Nicaragua has improved access and

   If we let y = Y/N be the output per capita of a given country, we have that ∆ = ∆        +∆    where the working-
                                                                                       
age population is denoted by WAP. Thus, if the working-age share of the population rises by one percentage point,
then per capita output growth would rise by the same amount.

studying the ENMV surveys.

retention in basic education (grades 1 to 9) and has increased the educational attainment (average
years of completed education) of the emerging cohorts. However, primary and secondary
completion rates remain low, and learning outcomes (based on test scores) continue to be among
the lowest in Central America. There is a very high dropout rate in lower secondary school, which
suggests that the economic effort of keeping children in school is unprofitable for low-income
families, due to the lack of job opportunities for lower secondary graduates. This problem is
reinforced by outdated curricula and the lack of technical and vocational options.80

33.     Nicaragua’s educational attainment lags behind Central America and countries at
similar levels of development. The high school dropout rate is a particular cause of concern due
to its adverse consequences for youth opportunity, social cohesion and long-term productivity.81
Fewer young adults in Nicaragua have completed secondary compared to lower middle income
countries (Box 3.3). A cohort analysis using survey data (Adelman and Székely, 2016) reveals that
even though more young people now enroll in secondary than in the past, Nicaragua faces immense
challenges to keep them in school. The secondary school dropout rate is 36 percent, with 44 percent
occurring at lower secondary ages, 22 percent during the transition between lower and upper
secondary, and 34 percent occurring at upper secondary ages (Table 3.4). In addition, primary
dropout, and even initial participation, still remains a serious challenge in the country.

34.    The education system is not generating graduates adequately prepared for the labor

                             Box 3.3: Revisiting past World Bank advice (I)
Despite progress achieved over recent years, several World Bank studies indicate the need to address
pending issues in the education sector to better equip new entrants in the labor market. For instance, findings
in Better Jobs in Nicaragua: The Role of Human Capital (2012) indicate that “gains in years of education
at the cohort level have been small. For example, in 2009 the 20–25 year old group had only half-a-year
more of education than the 25–30 year old group, a small gain for a 5-year period, considering the young
age group. And within the 20 years old cohort, 75% have finished primary education and only 50% have
completed the first cycle of secondary education, placing Nicaragua behind Costa Rica, Panama, and El
Salvador, and at a similar level to Honduras . . . Hence, Nicaraguan youth are ill equipped to face the
demands in terms of skills of the labor market in the 21st century” (p. 27).

This situation, however, is not new. There are differences in the magnitude of the problem when compared
to the past, yet the assessment is similar. A description of the education sector in a 1973 report also indicates
that “in general, the labor force has a low level of education and only about 6 percent had post-primary or
higher education. The low level of formal education, which implies high costs of training workers for the
modern sectors, is evident also in urban areas where about 45 percent of the labor force has less than 3
years of formal education and only about 10 percent have post-primary education” (p. 14).

The 1973 report identifies issues such as low retention rates, weak performance of schools in particular in
rural areas, teachers’ qualifications and the irrelevance of a large part of the curriculum: “The education
system is extremely inefficient. At the end of the 1960’s, only 12 percent of students who started primary
school five years earlier entered Grade VI. This very low retention largely reflects the exceptionally poor
performance in rural areas where only 2 percent of students reach Grade VI. Even in urban areas, however,
almost two-thirds of students do not complete the primary cycle. The low average retention indicates a
tremendous wastage of resources, although it represents a significant improvement compared to the 8
percent of the 1955 cohort which reached Grade VI in 1960. About three-quarters of students drop out by
the end of the third year and can be considered functionally illiterate. Most primary school graduates enter
secondary school, but less than one-half continue beyond the basic cycle which is essentially a continuation
of primary, nonterminal education . . . The main reasons for the inefficiency of the secondary system are
inadequate facilities, uneven distribution of available capacity among various areas of the country, the
large number of unqualified teachers and the irrelevance of a large part of the curriculum. Many students,
especially in rural areas, cannot obtain a complete primary education simply because several schools—
about 60 percent of those in rural areas—do not offer instruction beyond Grade III” (p. 18).

The Central America Social Expenditures and Institutional Review: Nicaragua (2016) provides a strikingly
similar characterization: Despite gains in basic education attainment, completion rates are still low when
compared with peer countries. Furthermore, learning outcomes continue to be among the lowest in Central
America. Policies implemented since 2008 have contributed to improved access and retention in basic
education (grades 1 to 9), as well as to increased educational attainment of the population as a whole.
However, completion rates for both primary and secondary school remain quite low in comparison to other
Central American countries. Dropouts especially at late primary and lower secondary may be related to
the prevalence of overage students, whose population has grown due to high repetition rates. Secondary
school dropouts are likely driven by a lack of interest in school and/or by economic reasons. In addition,
secondary school might not be sufficiently attractive for students due to an outdate curricula and the lack
of technical and vocational education options” (p. 11)

“Multigrade schools were mainly present in rural areas due to the dispersion of the population, the lack of
teachers and/or the lack of infrastructure . . . Multigrade schools favor the existence of what are called
“incomplete schools,” which only offer first through third grade, third to fifth grade, or fourth to sixth
grades. Despite being a solution for very small communities, this division creates challenges to continuity
of learning and results in higher levels of dropouts, especially when the schools are far away from each
other (i.e., a student finishes first grade and has to move to another community school to attend third
grade)” (p. 61).

35.     As Nicaragua’s structural transformation accelerates, enhanced skills will be in
growing demand. Labor market outcomes are already strongly linked to education attainment in
Nicaragua. Unemployment rate for people ages 25–45 is higher among individuals who fell short
of completing upper secondary (Table 3.5). Informality also seems to be more prevalent at lower
levels of education attainment. The rate of informality among workers who only reached lower
secondary is 12 percentage points higher than for workers who reached upper secondary and 33
percentage points higher when compared to individuals with at least some higher education.
Adelman and Székely (2016) also present supporting evidence suggesting that there are important
differences in wage levels. As discussed in Chapter 4, Nicaragua has relatively low-skill premia,
likely reflecting a combination of limited labor demand growth and poor education quality.
Nevertheless, the skills premium for upper secondary relative to lower secondary for individuals
19–24 years of age is already at 45 percent and is likely to rise as Nicaragua’s economic
transformation accelerates. So if the quality issues in secondary education are not tackled, skills
constraints could quickly choke off the transition toward upper middle income status.

36.    High school dropout rates are closely related to the problem of ninis in Nicaragua.
Youth who are neither working nor in school, or NEET, are often labeled ninis (“ni estudia ni
trabaja” in LAC). Table 3.6 shows that about one in five youth in Nicaragua is not working nor



                                                     51
attending an educational institution.83 Following a steep increase around 2009, the number of ninis
only dropped marginally by 2014. Despite the strong economic rebound postcrisis and the
observed reduction in poverty over the same period, the problem has been persistent. In order for
Nicaragua to take full advantage of the first demographic dividend, and achieve higher levels of
income and faster economic growth, a higher number of working-age people need to be employed
productively. Youth who leave before completing the secondary level often fail to secure formal
sector jobs, either falling into the unemployed ranks or ending up with lower incomes and poorer
job prospects in the informal sector. Addressing the issues of ninis and school dropouts would
likely accelerate the growth rate of the economy and labor productivity.

Infrastructure and capital accumulation
37.     Given Nicaragua’s large infrastructure gap, investments in basic infrastructure will
generate high economic returns. Improving infrastructure and access to basic services would
help lift competitiveness, in particular for low value-added products such as agriculture, and also
contribute to the reduction of existing regional disparities. The existing road infrastructure is
among the least developed in the region, making access to markets difficult and decreasing product
quality due to long transport periods. In addition, Nicaragua has one of the highest electricity prices
in Central America, as well as across LAC, due to the country’s heavy dependence on oil for power
generation. Addressing these issues would crowd in private investment and foster private sector
activity.

38.      Nicaragua’s economic development is closely linked to international trade. A small
domestic market with low purchasing power of the general population underscores the importance
of external markets in the country’s development process. As of 2015, Nicaragua’s trade openness
(93 percent of GDP) was well above the average for LAC (44 percent) and lower middle income
countries (56 percent). As such, transport infrastructure and logistic systems will continue to be a
critical factor influencing competitiveness and the country’s attractiveness as a FDI destination. In
addition to some of the issues related to the road network discussed in more detail below, the main
logistics challenges stem from the high transportation costs, limited capacity of ports, reliance on
ports in neighboring countries, and long customs clearance waiting times.

  This is similar to the regional average. De Hoyos, Rogers and Székely (2016) estimate that one in five youth in the
region—totaling more than 20 million people aged 15–24—is living as a nini. The authors point that the most common
path to becoming a nini is school dropout followed by unemployment.

39.     Transport and associated logistics services account for a significant portion of the
final prices of goods in Nicaragua, affecting competitiveness in many sectors. Logistics
systems (i.e., the different interrelated services necessary to transport inputs of production from
suppliers to producers and to transport goods from producers to consumers) impact the
effectiveness of a country’s supply chain and, thus, the final prices of goods.84 High transport and
logistics costs primarily affect traditional import and export products, which tend to be low unit
value agriculture products, and therefore have direct implications for trade competitiveness. In
addition, this is particularly severe for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the rural poor,
due to their scale disadvantage and the longer distances they must cover to reach markets.

40.    Nicaragua has consistently received very low performance scores on macro indicators
related to transport infrastructure and logistics. The Global Competitiveness Index 2016–17
ranked Nicaragua 104 out of 138 countries in terms of general infrastructure, only ahead of
Venezuela (121) and Paraguay (122). Similarly, scores on the Logistics Performance Index 85
signal Nicaragua’s relative disadvantage in terms of transport infrastructure and logistics (Figure
3.15).

   About 50 percent of Nicaraguan firms surveyed indicated that they used material inputs and/or supplies of foreign
origin, highlighting the importance of imports for domestic production processes and the significance of an effective
logistics system for both imports and exports (Nicaragua Country Economic Memorandum: Promoting
Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth, World Bank 2014).

    The international Logistics Performance Indicator provides both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of
countries in six areas: (i) efficiency of the clearance process (speed, simplicity, and predictability) by border control
agencies; (ii) quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure (roads, ports, railroads, and information technology);
(iii) ease of arranging competitively priced shipments; (iv) competence and quality of logistics services (transport
operators and customs brokers); (v) ability to track/trace consignments; and (vi) timeliness of shipments in reaching
their destination within the scheduled delivery time.

                                                                               53
41.     Nicaragua’s road infrastructure is among the least developed in the region, and it is
a major constraint for domestic and international trade.86 Nicaragua ranks 84th in the world
in terms of its road infrastructure quality.87 The country’s current classified road network totals
24,137 km. Since 2010, the amount of paved network increased from 2,812 km to 3,653 km, and
the share of population with an access to a paved road rose from 28 percent to 38 percent. However,
the share of paved roads in the whole road network remains quite low at only 15 percent, of which
28 percent is in fair or good condition (Box 3.4). Moreover, floods have caused significant
damages to road infrastructure, and 30 percent of roads become unusable during the six-month
rainy season (May to October).88 Overall, lack of maintenance (Box 3.5) and poor condition of
access roads translate into high postharvest losses, high cost of transportation and limited access
to local and regional markets.89 This, in turn, reduces the competitiveness of Nicaraguan firms. In
the Pacific and Central regions, the poor quality of the roads rather than their availability is the
main constraint. As paved roads linking the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts are still lacking, most
of the country’s agricultural exports are shipped through Puerto Cortés in Honduras and Puerto
Limón in Costa Rica at a significant cost.

                                  Box 3.4: Revisiting past World Bank advice (II)

A World Bank Report of 1953 (The Economic Development of Nicaragua) identified challenges, constraints
and opportunities that are still relevant today for this diagnostic. Some principal weak points of the country
included “generally low standards of health and education” and “a transportation system improved in
recent years but still inadequate” (p. 4). Nicaragua has made important progress in these areas over time,
yet there is still ample room for improvement.
Road network
The report underscores the importance of transport investment centered “on the construction and
improvement of roads” (p. 214) to stimulate growth and the need for “a comprehensive network of main
roads on the west coast, supplemented by local meshes of feeder, access, and farm-to-market routes
throughout the country” (p. 214). The rationale for an expanded road network is that “Nicaragua needs
good roads not only to reduce the burden of inland transport charges but also to expand the existing
capacity of her transport arteries and to open for development new productive areas which are now
inaccessible” (pp. 214–15). Similarly, the Country Economic Memorandum of 2014 concludes that “poor
road quality leads to high domestic transport costs, reducing the competitiveness of Nicaraguan firms,
especially of those located in rural areas” (p. 123).

42.    Transport and logistic services play a key role in determining the competitiveness of
Nicaraguan firms. The analysis of key routes90 for the transportation of agriculture products (the
cases of beef in Nueva Guinea and watermelon in El Tuma Dalia) from production zones to
Atlantic ports indicates that logistics bottlenecks increase transport time to the nearest port by 32.1
percent in the case of beef (via Puerto Limón in Costa Rica) and 48 percent in the case of
watermelon (via Puerto Cortés in Honduras). A supply chain analysis for beef exports to the US
suggests that logistics costs could add 11 percent to the final wholesale price of a kilogram of
frozen ground beef in the best-case scenario and up to 21 percent in the worst-case scenario.91

43.      Heavy dependence on oil for power generation and sector weaknesses have led to
relatively high and volatile electricity prices, with negative implications for competitiveness
and investment. Table 3.7 shows the electricity tariffs disaggregated by residential, commercial
and industrial uses as of June 2016. Nicaragua had the second highest commercial and industrial
tariffs among Central American countries, only behind Costa Rica. Several enterprise surveys
(FUNIDES/COSEP 2016, World Bank 2010) identify electricity and the cost of electricity
provision as major constraints.

44.     Heavy reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation has translated into high prices
of electricity when oil prices were high. The costs of electricity generation have also proved to
be highly volatile given its strong correlation with international oil prices. Other underlying factors
behind higher prices can be traced to technical losses and lack of economies of scale in production
(FUNIDES, 2016) (Figure 3.16). Despite reducing losses from 31.9 percent of total generation in
2000 to 24.7 percent, Nicaragua displayed the second highest loss in 2015 only behind Honduras.
In addition, Nicaragua’s maximum demand of electricity was 665.4 MW, or just 61 percent of that
in El Salvador, reflecting the small size of Nicaragua’s market. Inefficient energy consumption

further undermined the country’s competitiveness. Nicaragua’s economy’s energy intensity is
among the highest in the Central America region and well above the LAC average. High, volatile
electricity costs increase production costs, thus hampering firms’ competitiveness and acting as a
disincentive for investment.

3.4.2. Enhancing competitiveness in Nicaragua
45.     Nicaragua has the potential to grow at a faster pace. So far, Nicaragua has relied
primarily on factor accumulation. Yet a model based on factor accumulation alone will not be
enough to lift growth into a higher trajectory. To enhance competitiveness, Nicaragua has to take
additional steps toward strengthening institutions and reforming the public sector to make it more
efficient and improving its business regulations and investment climate—particularly in areas such
as access to finance, regulations and red tape, customs procedures and competition—improving
the productivity in the agriculture sector and lifting constraints for the private sector to flourish.

Strengthening institutions and capacity of the public sector
46.      Institutional indicators suggest that Nicaragua faces significant challenges in this
areas. The Global Competitiveness Index 2016–17 ranked Nicaragua 122nd out of 138 countries
       92

in the institutions pillar. The country ranks low in several categories (Figure 3.17), in particular in
judiciary independence (136), favoritism in decisions of government officials (129), property
rights (124), and transparency of government policy making (117). The Worldwide Governance
Indicators (WGI) also signal broad institutional weaknesses. According to the WGI, for 2015
Nicaragua ranked at the bottom third of all countries: the median (mean) of the percentile rank
across the WGI was 31.4 (30.9). A comparison with the region (Figure 3.18) shows that the country
trailed LAC’s average (54.6) by a large margin. Nicaragua’s ranking in the WGI was also low
compared to other lower middle income countries.

92
  Since the 1990s, Nicaragua has gradually embarked in a transition process from being a conflict-affected state
toward becoming a relatively effective state. According to the 2011 WDR, even the fastest transforming countries
have taken between 15 and 30 years to raise their institutional performance from that of a fragile state to that of a
functioning institutionalized state.

47.     Bureaucratic quality indicators suggest that there is a need to strengthen knowledge,
capabilities, and systems for the civil service, including informing the public of the collection
and use of public resources in delivering government services. Respondents in the executive
survey of the Global Competitiveness Report identified the inefficient government bureaucracy as
the most problematic factor in doing business for six years in a row. In addition, bureaucratic
quality indicators suggest that Nicaragua is lagging behind all other Central American countries.93
In order to strengthen the capabilities of the civil service and their effectiveness, Nicaragua needs
to work towards decision-making processes that are less concentrated and further empowering

civil servants in this area. Failing to disentangle technical decisions from political forces may lead
to inaction or failed implementation, as continuously ensuring political loyalty can affect the speed
and the ability to take and implement decisions throughout the administrative chain. One identified
weakness is the need to foster broad-based debate and evidence-based policy making. Establishing
impact evaluations of selected programs and strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems
could lead to better development outcomes. Although systematic administrative data is collected
in every line ministry and agency, these are rarely effectively used to adapt and adjust policies and
programs owing in part to weak capacity, but also to this over-centralization of key decision-
making.94

48.     Nicaragua has shown incremental capacity to implement projects and improve access
to basic services, yet there is still ample room to strengthen accountability and transparency.
Challenges in this area, if left unaddressed, could become stumbling blocks in bringing long-term
certainty to foreign and domestic investors. According to the International Country Risk Guide
indicator,95 Nicaragua’s democratic accountability has shown a steady deterioration since 2008,
declining from 6 points to 2.5 by September 2016. The WGI Voice & Accountability indicator—
reflecting freedom of press and association—has fallen from percentile rank 45.2 in 2000 to 35.0
in 2015. Survey results96 also suggest a declining trend in political tolerance in the country, falling
from 60 points (out of 100) in 2010 to 46.8 points in 2014.

49.     The 2015 Nicaragua Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Report
identifies some key shortcomings in public financial management. The General Directorate of
Government Accounting within the Ministry of Finance does not prepare consolidated financial
statements, a practice that is also not followed by individual institutions, which makes assessment
of the balance sheet of the government and public entities difficult. Lack of reliable and
comprehensive information on public finances may have an impact on fiscal transparency and in
the monitoring of fiscal risk. Effective and transparent management of public finances may help
Nicaragua generate trust to mobilize internal and foreign investment, in addition to supporting a
more strategic allocation of resources and monitoring of public expenditure. Given Nicaragua’s
geographical location and institutional weaknesses, it is also important to strengthen the
implementation of an anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) framework to prevent and detect illicit financial flows (IFFs) in the country.
Transparency and better access to information enhance accountability and the efficiency and
efficacy of the public sector. Altogether, this suggests that citizens’ chances to make the
government accountable and responsive are somewhat limited. These perceptions and indicators
undermine trust in the system and the country, and can hamper investment prospects, and thus
long-term growth.97

   Good governance can be seen as an incentive structure that reduces uncertainty and promotes efficiency, thereby
being a crucial building block for sustained growth, poverty reduction efforts and shared prosperity. Improved
governance can contribute toward the effective delivery of public goods, a reduction of policy uncertainty and
favoritism, lower transaction costs for businesses, ensuring public accountability of elected officials and public
servants through public information disclosure, and better implementation of existing policies (North and Thomas
(1973), Shleifer and Vishny (1993), De Soto (2000), Acemoglu and Johnson (2005), and WDR (2017), among others).

Business environment and investment climate
50.     Improving investment climate and firm productivity can be promising avenues to
reinvigorate private sector activity and foster competiveness. The analysis presented below
points to several constraining factors: limited market completion, barriers to entrepreneurship, high
concentration in the financial system and limited access to credit for micro, small and medium
enterprises (MSMEs), and cumbersome border crossing procedures. In addition, raising
productivity in agriculture and lifting sector specific constraints remains crucial to accelerate
growth in the country.

Access to Finance
51.     The financial system in Nicaragua is relatively small and highly concentrated. The
banking sector is comprised of seven private commercial banks (including two microfinance
banks), and one development bank. Banking assets are 98 percent of total financial system assets.
The three largest banks concentrate 77 percent of total assets, which is above the median for the
LAC region and the income group. The combined shares of the five largest banks are 96 percent
of assets, 92 percent of loans and 99 percent of deposits. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for
assets is the second highest in the region (Figure 3.19, panel a, Figure 3.19, panel b). The high
concentration of the Nicaraguan financial sector may be limiting competition and efficiency.

52.     Private credit remains low at 31 percent of GDP and with strikingly short maturities.
Central American countries with similar income per capita and population have higher private
sector credit, for example, El Salvador with 42 percent and Honduras with 55 percent. Credit
growth has been higher than that of deposits, and the total system portfolio is mainly concentrated
in commercial credit (35 percent) and consumer credit (25 percent). Industry and real estate have
a much lower share of total credit, representing 14 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Almost
all sectors have maintained a constant share throughout the last five years, except for agricultural
credit, which represented almost 13 percent in 2011 and decreased to around 8 percent by 2015.
In terms of maturities, short-term credit is predominant: by 2015, 87 percent of the total credit
portfolio was allocated to credit of up to 360 days, likely constraining potential long-term
investment projects. Higher and longer term finance in the economy, particularly to productive

sectors, can enable more investment and support employment and entrepreneurship. Commerce
(35 percent), personal loans (15 percent), housing (13.6 percent), industry (13 percent) and
agriculture (11.2 percent) were the major components of financial institutions’ loan portfolio over
2010–2015.

53.      Deepening credit for MSMEs is an important channel to boost investment and
employment. MSMEs represent more than 90 percent of registered companies, and it is estimated
that they provide employment to around 1.5 million people. According to the Enterprise Survey
2010, firms surveyed identified access to finance as their fourth main obstacle (third for small
firms). About 23.3 percent of companies mentioned that lack of access to finance was a main
restriction for their business and investment prospects. As a result, internal financing is the most
popular financing option among all types of enterprises. Historically, Nicaragua has had a vibrant
microfinance sector, but the lack of effective supervision led to lax credit analysis and client
selection practices in the industry, resulting in widespread lending to over-indebted borrowers.
The creation of the National Commission of Microfinance in 2011 has aided in reducing the risks
of the sector.

Customs procedures and border crossings
54.      The efficiency and effectiveness of border processes and procedures have a direct
effect on Nicaragua’s trade and competiveness and investment prospects.98 According to the
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report for 2016–17, Nicaragua is ranked 136th
in the world in customs procedures, far behind other countries in Central America. 99 In the
category of trading across borders of Doing Business 2017, Nicaragua is ranked 73rd, far behind
El Salvador (44th) and Panama (53rd) in Central America. The 2010 World Bank Enterprise
Surveys also supports this claim, as Nicaraguan firms seemed to suffer more than firms in other
countries in the region in terms of customs procedures. Improvements in trade facilitation, border
processes and procedures are critical areas to expedite export and import times, reduce costs and
lift firms’ competitiveness underlining the need of and benefit from further regional integration.100

55.      Despite recent modernization efforts, formalities and procedures at customs and
other border agencies are still adversely affecting trade flows, leading to delays and long and
uncertain waiting times at borders. Some of the main issues are lack of coordination between
border agencies, burdensome processes and procedures, and antiquated equipment or systems to
carry out inspections. Border crossings represent one of the biggest constraints on the cost-
effective and reliable delivery of Nicaraguan imports and exports. Border crossings through Costa
Rica and Honduras introduce the greatest delays into travel times for Nicaragua’s trade, and can
distort the flow of cargo toward a different route. This is of particular relevance because volumes
traded through Nicaraguan ports are relatively small, reflecting not only the small economy but
also the ports’ limited infrastructure, a lack of a deep water port in the Atlantic and the capacity to

    Nicaragua was the first country in Central America to ratify the World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation
Agreement in August 2015, which entered into force in February 2017. Most provisions are mandatory for all
members, including Nicaragua. Estimates by the OECD suggests that the implementation of TFA provisions aimed at
streamlining trade procedures could lead to cost reductions up to 15.1 percent in lower middle income countries.

handle growing volumes in a competitive manner. As a result, about 70 percent of Nicaraguan
traded cargo travels along the Pan-American Highway in transit through Honduras to Puerto Cortés
and through Costa Rica to Puerto Limón. Registration requirements for sanitary and phytosanitary
standards (SPS) also represent a potential obstacle to regional integration, in particular for exports
of agricultural and food products from developing countries. Increasing efficiency and reducing
bottlenecks in border crossings could yield important competitiveness gains. In addition,
improving coordination and harmonization of trade processes with neighboring countries would
help integrate the region with global value chains.

Regulations and competition
56.    Market competition is essential to spur entrepreneurship and innovation, and to raise
productivity.101 Empirical and theoretical studies show that competitive product markets force
companies to be more efficient, leading to an increase in labor productivity or multifactor
productivity and also a positive effect on employment.102 Low total factor productivity growth in
Nicaragua makes increasing market competition a priority. Nicaragua ranks at the bottom in the
category of extent of market dominance of the Global Competitiveness Index 2016–17 (135 out of
138 with a score of 2.68). In addition, perception indicators that capture not only what is “on the
books” but also implementation/application highlight potential discriminatory application in favor
of incumbents (Figure 3.20, panel a, Figure 3.20, panel b).

viable (Figure 3.21). Regulations that limit the entry of competitors where competition is viable
may reinforce market dominance in key services sectors. In addition, even though Nicaragua has
an overall adequate competition policy framework since 2006, competition law enforcement has
not been effective.

Lifting constraints in Nicaragua’s key sectors and industries
58.     Nicaragua’s land productivity is the lowest among regional peers. The average value
generated is only USD 717/ha (constant USD). To put this into perspective, this is between 40–60
percent of average figures for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and only 16 percent of Costa
Rica’s value of land productivity. Table 3.8 shows productivity gaps for specific crops and
livestock between Nicaragua and Central America. Raising land productivity could lift sectoral
growth and overall GDP growth of the economy. Increases in agricultural output so far have been
achieved mainly through an expansion in the agriculture area, raising concerns on the current
model based on the expansion of the agriculture frontier. Nicaragua has ample room to increase
agricultural production through intensification, optimization of land uses and sustainable
expansion of the agricultural frontier. Improvements in productivity through investments in
research and extension services aiming at agricultural intensification are needed to support a more
sustainable pattern of sectoral growth and poverty reduction objectives.104

59.    In addition, continued efforts to secure land property rights and strengthen
Nicaragua’s land administration institutions are critical to increase productivity in the
agricultural sector. In terms of registering property, Nicaragua ranks poorly (146th) in the Doing
Business report. The quality of land administration is low (index of 6.5 on a scale of 0 –30); an
estimated 35 to 40 percent of all land in Nicaragua faces some type of dispute or conflict. This
includes boundary disputes, restitutions of past rights, lack of documentation to prove legal
ownership or indigenous peoples’ claims over ancestral territories that overlap with other land

tenure regimes. 105 The country’s conflict afflicted history had an important influence in the
security of land tenure and property rights. Competing claims over the same plots of land and
unsecured land tenure have partly limited investment in the agriculture sector, hence, undermining
increases in land productivity. Several studies have found a positive relationship between the
receipt of a registered title, land value and investment. For instance, Deininger and Chamorro
(2004) found that, for the case of Nicaragua, receipt of registered title increased both land values
and the propensity to invest. To address these issues, the government of Nicaragua, with support
of the donor community, has made important strides to strengthen the land administration
framework. These included the approval of key legislation and policies (Titling of Indigenous
Peoples’ Lands Law (2003); Cadastre Law (2005); Public Registry Law (2009); Policy for
Protected Areas Law (2009); and a General Land Policy Framework (2010)).

60.     The coffee sector in Nicaragua needs to improve productivity levels, adopt newer
technologies, and ensure higher quality standards. Production efficiency analysis of the
sector106 points to an important gap between low and high efficient producers. Only 20 percent of
total producers displayed high levels of productive efficiency, accounting for 43 percent of total
production. These units produced on average 5.2 times more output per land unit, 4.3 times more
output per permanent worker, and 3.6 times more output per temporal worker than those displaying
low efficiency levels. Land productivity (measured by yields) for low productive units was about
19 percent compared to high productive units. Low levels of productive efficiency are not just
limited to subsistence and transition family farms, but also to an important share of both
commercial family farms (40.8 percent) and business agriculture (47 percent), suggesting ample
room for productivity gains through efficiency improvements among all segments of farmers.
Factors correlated to high levels of productive efficiency were size of replanted coffee area,
availability of proper equipment (e.g., milling equipment) and belonging to a producers’
organization, along with access to credit and technical assistance.107 Institutional strengthening and
coordination, and greater access to financing options, together with export market
diversification—toward markets with growing coffee consumption, mostly in Asia—will also
improve the outlook of the industry. Other factors to consider include the vulnerability to climatic

events and the fluctuation of international coffee prices. In particular, small producers do not have
access to financial instruments that help mitigate these risks.

61.     The sugar sector is one of the most advanced agribusiness sectors in the country but
to take it to the global standards, producers still face several challenges. Although the
Nicaraguan sugar sector has been at the forefront of technical advances such as energy generation
from bagasse, they are still not able to sell ethanol domestically due to lack of a legal framework
that would support the consumption of biofuels. Domestic production is highly exposed to weather
fluctuations, which can seriously curb or even diminish yields. Variations in supply and stockpiles,
due to challenges that the traditionally biggest players (Brazil, India, European Union, China) are
facing, lead to high levels of price volatility. Revenues are generally defined by seasonal yields,
which are mostly influenced by weather conditions. Improvements in agronomy (irrigation and
harvesting) can lead to higher levels of efficiency in the sector.

                                     Box 3.6: Agriculture in Nicaragua

Nicaragua’s agricultural sector is characterized by the presence of a sharp duality. Subsistence
farming (40.6 percent of all producers but only 2.5 percent of total farm area) is characterized by small farm
size, generally unable to provide a sustainable livelihood for farmers and acting as a social safety net that
prevents small-scale farmers from falling into poverty. Farms are often located far away from population
centers, with poor infrastructure and access to social services. This sector comprises largely poor, small-
scale producers of basic grains and coffee and other products for self-consumption and local markets
(maize, beans, rain-fed rice, sorghum, and livestock). On the other end of the spectrum are commercial
family farms and the agricultural business sector (accounting for 16.6 percent of total producers),
characterized by larger average farm size, commonly located in geographic areas with higher productive
potential, linked to agriculture value chains and commercially viable as businesses. This sector enjoys
access to means of production: capital, land, labor force, modern technology and high-value markets, all of
which provide producers with ample opportunities to improve efficiency.

This sharp duality calls for differentiated policies and interventions. Targeted by assistance programs
such as income support and cash transfers, complemented food security programs may be better suited for
subsistence family farmers. For transition family farmers (those in between subsistence and commercial
farming), implementing strategies to link them to markets, improving access to agriculture productivity by
enhancing services (i.e., extension, financial services, titling), assisting farmers in acquiring other sources
of income (i.e., facilitating access to funding for business startups, retraining, and other agriculture and non-
agriculture programs for income diversification), and promoting productive partnerships, associations, and
alliances between producers and buyers that help boost competitiveness may work better. On the other
hand, interventions for commercial family farmers need to focus on enhancing competitiveness and
encouraging entry into foreign markets. The public sector can play an important role in dealing with markets
failures such as credit, technology, logistics services, and infrastructure provision.

62.     One major issue in the cattle and dairy industry is the sector’s extremely low
productivity. Main constraints affecting the industry are: (i) poor technology and farm
infrastructure both in husbandry and animal feed, (ii) poor genetics and the need for introducing
new breeds, (iii) limited access to credit especially for small-scale farmers through commercial
banks or microfinance institutions, and (iv) inadequate government support to the industry on more
advanced phytosanitary standards and associated inspection and traceability systems. In addition,

                                                       64
access to export markets remains limited. Nicaragua is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and
Foot-and-Mouth disease free and maintains phytosanitary surveillance throughout the territory and
borders, compliant with FDA guidelines. The Association of Agreement with the European Union,
signed in August 2013, raised expectations for increased exports to this market. However, the
results have been disappointing, with producers unable to fulfill the beef quota, mainly because of
the industry’s inability to meet technical standards related to traceability, quality and farm
certification.

63.     The Nicaraguan palm oil industry has the ideal agroecological conditions and
necessary industrial facilities for the production and processing of concentrated palm oil.
Palm oil production is concentrated in the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region of
Nicaragua (RACCS, for its acronym in Spanish), with approximately 70 percent of the total
planted area, and Río San Juan with approximately 30 percent. Palm oil production currently uses
more than 21,075 hectares and has been developed by companies that work with small producers
and is mainly focused on the export market. According to PRONicaragua, Nicaragua’s investment
promotion agency, there are approximately 1.5 million hectares suitable for palm oil in the country.
In addition, these companies have invested in access roads and energy, which have improved the
infrastructure in the local communities. Challenges to increase production and exports of
concentrated palm oil include: (i) weak institutional capacity, reflected in the lack of capacity to
process permits and perform inspections in a timely manner by government agencies; (ii) weak
infrastructure, as access to roads, energy, and telecommunication is limited in most areas suitable
for palm oil plantations; (iii) high cost of establishing palm oil mills, which are not only limited to
limited basic infrastructure, but also to complex land ownership and land tenure; (iv) lack of
qualified/skilled labor due to low density, seasonal migration patterns, difficult training and hiring
of personnel; (v) growing demand from the consumers in the developed countries to buy certified
oil (certification of sustainable production); and (vi) lack of a deep water port in the Atlantic to
increase access to markets.

64.     The light manufacturing sector is dealing with lack of product diversity and
sophistication as well as high energy prices. Firms are generally focusing on simple garments,
wire harnesses and basic medical devices, not yet engaging in high value-added products. As the
country has no raw material production (plastics, synthetics, nylon, lycra, etc.), value-addition
within Nicaragua is limited. In addition, roads are poorly maintained and sometimes impassable,
with the exception of a few major intercity links. Seaport infrastructure is limited, and costs are
high.108 More importantly, high energy prices impose a significant operating cost. Nicaraguan
operators therefore often find that their competitive advantage due to lower labor cost is erased
due to higher energy prices, which represent a large share of the firms’ operating costs. Also
expansion to higher value products is limited due to low productivity and lack of skilled labor.

65.     In addition, while the special economic zone regime succeeded in generating
employment and increasing exports, it is costly and has fallen short in forging backward
linkages to the domestic economy. The special economic zone system provides a number of
benefits to firms at the expense of important fiscal costs. These include exemptions such as: (i)
income tax in the first ten years with the possibility of a ten-year extension; (ii) custom duties and

tariffs on inputs and goods, machinery and transport equipment related to its operation; (iii)
indirect, sales and excise taxes; (iv) municipal taxes; (v) export taxes; and (vi) taxes on purchases
of domestic goods. In addition, the tax code provides additional benefits for exporters. 109 Yet,
unlike East Asian experience of successful free economic zones, firms under special economic
zones have not managed to build linkages with firms in the domestic economy. An increase in the
interactions through supply chain links between special economic zone firms and the domestic
economy could generate positive knowledge and technology spillovers from FDI. Part of the
problem in these schemes is the implicit incentive for firms to access imports free of duty and
therefore less likely to opt to buy inputs from local suppliers. The lack of a local supplier base may
also act as a barrier.

66.      Nicaragua’s tourism industry lags behind its regional peers. While low levels of crime
and a low-cost, well-educated workforce make the country an attractive location, the industry is
lagging behind its regional peers in terms of size, investment and tourism arrivals. The most
critical constraints for the industry are (i) inadequate infrastructure and insufficient public-private
sector coordination to develop access to tourism locations; (ii) comparatively weaker brand and
promotion efforts; (iii) limited support for micro businesses and SMEs in the tourism sector, since
they are not covered by Law 306; (iv) lack of skilled labor force; and (v) lack of access to
competitive bank financing for SMEs due to higher perceived risk and interest rates of over 12
percent.110

67.      Key binding constraints for sustained private sector growth. There are several cross-
cutting or recurring themes from the different industries that need to be improved in order for
productivity to increase in the private sector such as: (i) access to finance; (ii) targeted education;
(iii) inadequate infrastructure; (iv) high energy costs; and (v) difference between low and high
efficient producers.

4. EQUITY AND INCLUSION
 Nicaragua’s income inequality is among the lowest in LAC, while it is among the highest
 worldwide. This chapter looks at elements that could have contributed to these relatively low
 levels of inequality, including low skill premium. Low returns to education are the result of low
 quality formal education and a skill mismatch in the labor market. Despite improvements, many
 policy tools have not reached full potential, and there is room for progress on a number of
 dimensions to promote more inclusive growth going forward. These instruments include:
 investment in basic infrastructure and services; access to quality education, health, and social
 protection programs and transfers; taxation and subsidies; and female labor force participation
 and gender wage gaps.

1.      Nicaragua ranks among the countries with the lowest income inequality in LAC.
Chapter 2 shows that inequality fell between 2005 and 2009, while it increased slightly in the
following five years. Despite this rise in income inequality (and the high levels of inequality for
international standards), Nicaragua’s economy continued to be among the most egalitarian in
Central America and LAC in 2014. The relatively low levels of inequality are consistent with
Nicaraguans’ own perception of income inequality in the country. In 2015, opinion polls asked
citizens about their own perception of income inequality—i.e., whether they thought that income
distribution was (i) very fair, (ii) fair, (iii) unfair, or (iv) very unfair. 111 About three out of five
Nicaraguans thought that income distribution was either unfair or very unfair, making Nicaragua
with the most favorable perception of income distribution in LAC after Bolivia and Ecuador.

2.      What are the main factors behind this relatively low inequality? There are many
external and internal factors and policy tools that can potentially affect inequality in a given
country. This chapter focuses on a limited set of elements with substantial evidence supporting
their inequality reduction effects. These factors include the following: (i) investment in basic
infrastructure and services; (ii) access to quality education, health, and social protection programs
and transfers; (iii) female labor force participation and gender wage gaps; and (iv) earning gaps
between skilled and unskilled workers. Our analysis suggests relatively low returns to education
are among the main forces behind the relatively low levels of income inequality (for LAC’s
regional standards) in Nicaragua.

4.1. Restricted and unequal access to basic opportunities and services
3.      Children’s access to running water and sanitation in Nicaragua is among the lowest
and most unequally distributed in LAC. The Human Opportunity Index (HOI) measures access
to basic opportunities and services—e.g., access to water, sanitation, and electricity—adjusted for
how fairly they are distributed. 112 , 113 Access to basic infrastructure and services early in life

111
      See Latinobarómetro (2015).
112
    See Barros et al. (2009), Molinas et al. (2010), and World Bank (2014) for a detailed description.
113
    The HOI penalizes the traditional coverage rate—i.e., percentage of children with access to some basic service —
by subtracting a measure that captures the degree of inequality in access to basic infrastructure. Therefore, the
difference between the HOI and the coverage rate for a given opportunity reflects the degree of inequality in the access
to that particular opportunity. The stronger is the relationship between access to basic services and individual, family,
and community circumstances that are out of children’s control (e.g., gender, household income, and place of
residence) the bigger is this penalization and the larger is the gap between the coverage rate and the HOI —see Box
4.1 for a detailed description of the circumstances considered for measurement.

                                                          67
improves children’s health and well-being throughout their life cycle.114 The indicator focuses on
children aged 16 and under to focus on opportunities early in life, as well as to eliminate the effect
of effort and choices. The HOI for running water within the dwelling (see Box 4.1 for definitions)
was 24 percent in 2014 (Figure 4.1, panel a), only higher than the HOI in El Salvador (18 percent).
Similarly, the HOI for access to sanitation within the property was 45 percent in 2014, being only
higher to the HOI in Honduras (38 percent), Bolivia (32 percent), Guatemala (25 percent), and El
Salvador (16 percent).

                      Box 4.1: Definition of basic housing opportunities and services

This section focuses on access to basic opportunities and services that are relevant for development and that
are used in multidimensional poverty indexes in LAC. In particular, it focuses on access to three housing
services: running water, sanitation, and electricity. These indicators are computed using harmonized
household surveys from SEDLAC project (CEDLAS and the World Bank) and available at the LAC equity
LAB within the World Bank. Harmonized definitions of access are used to increase cross-country
comparability. Therefore, the numbers presented in this report might differ from official statistics on access
to basic services reported by national statistical offices.

Given data limitations and the need to increase comparability across countries, we define the simplest
form of access to these services. To do that, we follow Molinas et al. (2012) and World Bank (2014). A
household is defined as having access to electricity if it reports having access independently of the source
of the service received. A household is also classified as having access to sanitation if it has a toilet within
the property connected to any source of waste-removal system. Finally, a household is defined as having
access to running water if it has running water within the dwelling. All these opportunities are also used
to measure the HOI. Individual circumstances used to measure this index are: parent’s education, child’s
gender, gender of the head of the household, household per capita income, area of residence (urban or
rural), presence of both parents in the household, and number of child’s siblings.

4.     A systematic way to explore the contribution of access to water and sanitation to
income inequality is the D-index, which shows that access is largely unequal. Societies with
unequal access to children’s basic opportunities are more likely to present higher income
inequality. The D-index reflects how access is affected by children circumstances. The larger the
D-index, the more unequal is the access to basic opportunities—i.e., the larger is the gap between
coverage and HOI. Nicaragua presents an important challenge to achieve equality in children’s
access to water and sanitation (Figure 4.1, panel b). The D-index is the second highest in LAC
after El Salvador. A decomposition exercise helps to understand the relative contribution of
individual, household, and community characteristics to the overall inequality in access to water.

114
   Broader and more egalitarian access to basic infrastructure and services is associated with lower poverty and
inequality, and improved well-being of the population. Empirical evidence has found a strong link between lower
children’s mortality rates and higher access to water and sanitation (Barros et al. 2009). Access to water and sanitation
improves children’s health and reduces communicable diseases, and it also saves time by reducing the need to fetch
water and decreasing missed school days due to sickness. Higher levels of environmental contamination are also
associated to poor water and sanitation systems (World Health Organization, UN-water 2014). Similarly, access to
electricity improves well-being and increases access to other basic opportunities—e.g., allowing nighttime studying,
accessing information via television and internet, etc. (Molinas et al. 2012). Electrification can also increase rural
incomes by making business more productive and reducing gender inequality by freeing up women’s time—e.g., time
previously spent collecting firewood (World Bank 2016b). Therefore, inequities in access to all these basic
opportunities and services among children at early stages translates into children with different jobs and earnings,
which may increase inequality of outcomes later in life.

                                                          68
Place of residence (urban vs. rural), household income, and parents’ education are the main
circumstances limiting children’s access to water and sanitation services: almost 85 percent of this
inequality is attributable to these circumstances, which represents an important barrier for
intergenerational mobility.

5.      The share of the total population with access to running water and sanitation has
increased significantly in recent years, though it still remains among the lowest in the region.
Nicaragua witnessed important gains in expanding access to running water and sanitation in the
last 15 years. The proportion of households with running water within the dwelling increased
significantly from 25 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2014 (Figure 4.2, panel a), the second largest
increment in LAC after Bolivia. Similarly, the proportion of households with access to proper
sanitation increased from 52 to 58 percent between both years. Still, access to water and sanitation
services remains far from universal in the country—over 60 and 40 percent of Nicaraguans do not
have access to such services, respectively—and lag behind other countries in LAC.

6.      Provision of water and sanitation services is highly unequal across the country. Access
to water and sanitation remains low, especially for those at the lower end of the income
distribution. In 2001, only 8 percent of households in the poorest quintile of the income distribution
had access to running water within their dwellings, compared to 48 percent of those among the
richest 20 percent (Figure 4.2, panel b). Nicaragua saw gains in terms of access in the last 15 years,
especially among the poorest. Still, about eight out of ten individuals in the lowest quintile did not
have access to water within their dwellings in 2014. Access was extremely low even among the
better off; in 2014, about four out of ten individuals in the highest quintile of the per capita income
distribution did not have access to running water. The distribution of the service also varies
considerably within the country: almost nine out of ten households in rural areas and in the

Caribbean did not have access to running water in 2014. As discussed in Chapter 5, climate change
will disproportionally affect areas dependent on groundwater for household consumption and
agricultural production, which can result in significant economic losses.

7.      The quality of basic infrastructure is also lagging behind. Recent available micro data
does not allow for measuring the quality of the services directly. The 2005 Living Standard
Measurement Study (LSMS) survey—the latest available survey that included a measure of
quality—showed that quality of the water provision—measured as continuity of service supply—
was poor in general and in particular among the most vulnerable groups of the population.115 About
a third of the population in Managua had partial water supply in 2005, while roughly half of those
living in the Caribbean lacked constant service provision. A 2015 study also presents similar
evidence in 20 rural municipalities of the country;116 roughly 40 percent of households had water
less than five hours per day in 2013. The situation is critical during the dry season; approximately
one in ten families had more than three consecutive days without access to water. Many families
needed to travel long distances in order to get water. Finally, nearly one out of five families thought
that the water they consumed was polluted either from feces, soap, rubbish, or dead animals. As
discussed in Chapter 5, mining is another activity that is contaminating rivers and aquifers. Sewer
systems rarely operate in an acceptable manner, which results in wastewater discharged without
treatment and poor sewage disposal.

8.     Since adult women are relatively more in charge of fetching water, walking long
distances to get water affects their productivity. The task of fetching water places important
constraints on women’s use of time for more productive activities. About one in ten families spent

                                                                                 70
more than 30 minutes to fetch water daily that year. Roughly one in five families consumed below
the critical value of 20 liters per person per day recommended by the World Health Organization.

9.      Poor access to water and sanitation has resulted in heightened environmental health
risks, especially in children under five years of age. The total estimated cost associated with
inadequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene amounted to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2007,
imposing a significant burden on Nicaragua’s economy. These costs include the diarrheal mortality
and morbidity, related health impacts (medical treatment, medicines, and value of lost time), and
averting expenditures mostly associated with the purchase of bottled water and disinfecting water
through boiling or chlorination to avoid health risks. The cost of health impacts represents an
estimated 87 percent, and preventive expenditures related to filtering or chlorinating water
represent about 13 percent of total costs.117

10.     Access to electrification services also remains far from universal, significantly lower
than other LAC countries, and highly unequal. Despite increasing significantly in the last 15
years, the proportion of households with access to electricity remained the lowest in LAC in 2014.
Roughly one out of five Nicaraguan households did not have access to electricity in 2014 (30
percent of households in the wealthiest quintile of the income distribution vs. 8 percent in the
bottom quintile) up from one out of three in 2000.118 There are also marked regional differences
in access: electrification was almost universal in urban areas in 2014 (98 percent), while four out
of ten Nicaraguans living in rural areas did not have access. Nicaragua also faces an important
challenge to achieving equality in children’s access to electricity. The D-index for electrification
is by far the largest in LAC and almost 55 percent of this index was linked to the place of residence.

11.     Lack of access to energy has also important implications for health risks as
households tend to rely on solid fuels for cooking. Nine out of ten households burn fuelwood in
inefficient stoves in poorly ventilated places in rural areas and one-third of the urban population
use solid fuel for cooking. 119 Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease are the most common diseases associated with indoor air pollution in
Nicaragua. Women and children spend more time at home, therefore they are the most affected by
indoor air pollution. Each year, an estimated 140 to 200 children under age five die from ARIs in
rural areas, and an additional 40 to 70 children die in urban areas in Nicaragua. Among children
under age five, more than half a million annual cases of ARIs in rural areas, and more than 200,000
cases in urban areas, can be linked to indoor air pollution. The total estimated annual cost for
indoor air pollution accounted for about 0.83 percent of GDP in 2007 and the rural poor accounted
for 56 percent of that cost.

12.     Nicaragua spends large amounts of resources in water and electricity subsidies that
tend to benefit more those who are better-off. Given that the provision of piped water and
electricity is highly unequal along the income distribution, subsidies in general tend to be
regressive as they do not benefit the poor. Hernandez et al. (2016) show that Nicaragua’s electricity
subsidies are among the least equitable in Central America; only a quarter of subsidies are received
by the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, while 56 percent are received by the top 40

percent. The study shows that for every dollar received by Nicaraguans in the lowest quintile of
the per capita income distribution, about USD 3.5 is received by individuals in the wealthiest
quintile (Figure 4.3, panel a); the least progressive subsidies in Central America—and significantly
higher than the Central American average of USD 2.1. However, even when they tend to be
regressive, electricity subsidies generate important savings among the poorest households. In the
bottom income decile, electricity costs are reduced from 7.5 percent of household income before
subsidies to 4.6 percent after subsidies (Figure 4.3, panel b).

4.2. Limited and unequal access to and quality of education

13.    Access to education of good quality provides many opportunities later in life and it is
highly associated with poverty reduction. Inequities in education access and quality translate


                                                                                 72
into higher income inequality later in life and tend to perpetuate poverty. 120 Youth with lower
levels of education have less opportunities in the labor market in general—i.e., employment and
wages.121 As such, poverty is highly associated with education outcomes. For instance, the poverty
rate of Nicaraguans living in households where at least one member completed secondary
education is lower (23 percent) than those who live in households where no member completed
secondary level (49 percent). 122 A decomposition analysis conducted to understand the
contribution of the years of education to the reduction of the poverty in the country between 2005
and 2014 concluded that years of education explained about a quarter of that poverty reduction.123

14.     Nicaragua ranks among the countries with the lowest years of education in LAC. In
2014, the average years of education of head of households in Nicaragua were the lowest after
Guatemala and Honduras and significantly lower than the LAC regional average (Figure 4.4). In
addition, the average years of education of households’ heads in the top 60 percent of the income
distribution almost doubled the average years of education of head of households in the bottom 40
(Figure 4.5). Years of education also varied significantly across regions and areas of residence
within the country.

15.     Chronic malnutrition and low access to quality early education affect children’s
development and performance in the education system, particularly for children living in
rural areas. Stunting impairs brain development and is negatively correlated with educational
attainment (Galasso and Wagstaff 2016; Grantham-McGregor et al. 2007; Victora et al. 2008,
Glewwe et al. 1995; Glewwe et al. 2001). International evidence shows that children who did not
attend to preschool education are more likely to have poor academic performance, to repeat grades,
and to drop out of school more than those whose cognitive skills and overall school readiness were
higher upon primary school entry (Naudeau and Hasan 2016; Feinstein 2003; Pianta and McCoy
1997; Currie and Thomas 1999). Nicaragua has the lowest access rates to preschool of Central
America, after Guatemala (World Bank 2016a). Late entrance to the system is related to both
cultural aspects (i.e., lack of interest in preschool education by the indigenous and rural
communities) and low preschool supply (MINED 2016). According to EMNV 2014, the
percentage of students entering the system at the age of five is about 80 percent in urban areas, 60
percent in rural areas, and only 50 percent in the Caribbean Coast Regions. In addition, preschool
quality tends to be lower in rural areas, where about 60 percent of the children attend community
preschools, led by low trained volunteer teachers. This late entry and low quality derives in high
dropouts and repetition in early grades, as well as high overage rates: 15 percent repetition and 16
percent dropout in first grade and ten percent repetition and nine percent dropouts in second grade
(MINED 2016).

16.      The country has significantly improved access to education and completion rates, but
still lags behind regional averages. Completion rates increased from 30 percent in 1985 to 85
percent in 2010 for primary education, while lower secondary increased by about 45 percentage
points from 21 percent to 67 percent between both years (Figure 4.5). Even when this implies a
significant progress, completion rates lag behind regional averages. Girls outperform boys in terms
of completion rates: in 2010, 89 and 74 percent of girls completed primary and lower secondary
education respectively, compared with 82 and 61 percent of boys.124

17.      The education system does not perform well with respect to student retention. As
discussed in Chapter 3, high school dropout raises concerns due to its impact on productivity and
inclusiveness. About 12 percent of lower secondary school age adolescents were out of school in
2010 compared with 6 percent in LAC. In primary education, both demand- and supply-side
challenges exist; distance to the school is among the main reasons for dropping out. In secondary
education, demand-side factors are more relevant: the lack of interest, financial problems, and the
opportunity cost are mentioned among the main reasons for not attending secondary education.125
Boys and girls leave school for different reasons: boys are more likely to leave school prematurely
to enter the labor market, while girls leave for resource constraints and/or to assist with domestic
work. 126 Teenage pregnancy is another important factor affecting female exit from secondary
school. 127 Discouragement for overage, driven mainly by late entry and repetition since early
grades in primary education, is also likely to have an impact on dropout rates. Nicaragua has the
highest overage rate in LAC at the primary level (63 percent in 2014). Overage in the primary
level is disproportionally higher among the poorest, in rural areas, and in the Caribbean coast. 128

18.      There are marked inequities in access to education, particularly in secondary and
postsecondary education. Large inequalities exist in access to education between income groups,
area of residence, and regions. Net enrollment rates are roughly universal in primary education,
however enrollment declines for all income groups, and the gap between the lowest and highest
quintile widens in secondary and postsecondary levels (Figure 4.6, panel a). Access to education
is particularly low in rural areas (Figure 4.6, panel b) and in the Caribbean. The gap between urban
and rural areas—and Caribbean and the rest of the regions of Nicaragua—in the first years of
education is associated with late entry into school of those children living in poor households,
while it is linked to restricted access to education opportunities and geographical and climate
obstacles for children aged more than 12 years.

19.     The probability of finishing primary level is highly unequal in Nicaragua compared
to other countries in the region. Once again, we use the D-index to explore the contribution of
education to the inequality in Nicaragua. The index is the largest in LAC (Figure 4.7), reflecting a
high inequality in the probability of completing primary education. Parental education is among
the main circumstances determining inequality in access to this basic opportunity; roughly one-
third of the inequality in finishing primary education across groups of circumstances is attributable
to parents’ education, which stresses the high intergenerational transmission of poverty in the
country.

20.    Not only is unequal access a source of great concern; the quality of education is also
lagging behind. Education of good quality has important implications for development as it
contributes to sustained long run economic growth. Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) provide
evidence that low quality education may explain more than half of the differences in incomes
between LAC and the rest of the world. Many countries in the region have made some progress
regarding school attendance and enrollment, however they are still behind in terms of quality of
education.129 Nicaragua is not the exception, the level of training and qualification of Nicaragua’s

teacher workforce is of concern. Teacher qualification has improved for the primary level in recent
years, however it remains quite low for preschool and the secondary level. In 2013, about one in
six teachers in the primary level did not have a graduate degree. That share was much higher in
secondary level: 43 percent of teachers did not have a graduate degree that year. 130 The country
presents the lowest share of trained teachers compared with other countries in the region for which
data are available (Figure 4.8). In 2010, about half of the teachers were not properly trained in the
secondary level, compared to about eight out of ten teachers on average at the regional level.

21.    Low quality education is notorious when comparing the standardized reading, math,
and natural sciences scores. Standardized test scores in LAC countries are in general significantly
lower than more developed economies.131 Nicaragua is not an exception. The country has one of
the lowest TERCE reading scores in sixth grade after the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, and

Honduras (Figure 4.9)—though they are slowly improving.132 Learning outcomes are affected by
the lack of an early education: results of international standardized evaluations applied in the
country show that students from grades three and six who attended preschool have better reading
and math scores (MINED, based on UNESCO/TERCE results, 2016). However, World Bank
(2016) shows that despite being among the lowest in the region, the gap in scores among income
groups, private/public schools, urban/rural areas, boys/girls, and regions within the country is
small in general, which suggest that low scores are equally distributed across different groups.
Nicaraguans area also generally satisfied with the public education they receive (Box 4.2).

            Box 4.2: Nicaraguans are in general satisfied with the public education they receive

Despite having among the lowest quality education in the region, Nicaraguans are in general satisfied with
the quality of their public education. Even when education tends to be of poor quality according to objective
measures—e.g., proportion of teachers trained, standardized tests, etc., Nicaraguans tend to be satisfied
with the public education they receive. According to opinion polls, in 2015 Nicaragua ranked second in
terms of LAC countries where individuals were satisfied with the public education (Latinobarometro 2015):
77 percent of Nicaraguans were satisfied with public education, the second highest after the Dominican
Republic (82 percent) and much higher than the LAC unweighted average (55 percent in LAC). Similarly,
the country had the lowest proportion of individuals who rated public school teachers’ knowledge of the
subject they teach, their presentism, and their ability to teach as very poor or fairly poor in 2011
(Latinobarometro 2011). World Bank (2008) finds similar results: perception about the quality of education
of parents with children in primary school are positive in general. The study suggests that high satisfaction
with the education received coupled with low quality of education is of great concern as it might end up
reducing individuals’ demand for better education.

4.3. Health: many challenges still lie ahead
22.     Despite the increase in overall public spending on health, the still low per capita public
expenditure limits service coverage and quality. Although Nicaragua’s public spending on
health’s share of GDP increased from 3.8 percent in 2007 to 5.1 percent in 2014, its per capita
public spending on health remained the same in 2007 constant dollars at 145 dollars since 2007,
being among the lowest in Central America and LAC.

five mortality rate declined from 42 to 17 per 1,000 live births between 1998 and 2011–2012. This
is partly due to an overall decrease in adolescent pregnancy, as well as an increase in the share of
babies born to adolescent mothers that were delivered in health facilities from 74 percent in 2007
to 94 percent in 2014. However, regional disparities persist: despite all efforts, mortality rates in
rural areas remain more than ten points higher than those in urban settings.

24.     The country has reduced maternal mortality, however, some challenges are still
present. MDG-related efforts included improving institutional births, providing immediate post-
delivery checkups, and implementing a ‘maternal houses’ strategy to provide women from rural
areas a place to stay to ensure safe and assisted delivery and postnatal care, among others. The
maternal houses strategy is a Government effort that complements institutional delivery and is
important for women’s birth plans, and includes a short stay prior to and postdelivery. The Birth
Plan is agreed between the parents to be and community leaders and includes details such as the

possible use of maternal houses, a transportation plan, a support network to care for the children
left at home, and possible emergency scenarios. In 2014 alone, the Ministry of Health identified
46,536 birth plans. The maternal house strategy was accompanied by measures for improving the
quality of care 133 in an effort to reduce maternal mortality. This contributed to reducing the
maternal mortality rate from 63 to 38 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births between 2009 and
2014. Despite this progress, Nicaragua ranks as the fourth highest in maternal mortality in LAC
and the highest in Central America.134 Challenges related to quality of care and inequities also
persist in the system with several Local Systems for Integral Health Care (Sistema Local de
Atención Integral en Salud, SILAIS) such as Boaco (78.5 per 100,000 live births), Jinotega (55.9
per 100,000 live births) and RAAS (160 per 100,000 live births) still having higher mortality rates.

25.     While adolescent pregnancy has decreased, it remains a major contributor to the high
maternal mortality rates and continues to be a challenge with widespread social and
economic implications. The rate of pregnancy among girls 10 to 19 years of age showed a small
decline from 26 percent in 2006–07 to 24 percent in 2011–12,135 but remains high. As discussed
in the previous section, adolescent pregnancy affects female exit from school: many young girls
either drop out of school and become pregnant or drop out of school due to pregnancy, thus facing
a vicious cycle of poverty.

26.     The nutritional status of Nicaraguans reflects accomplishments and highlights the
challenges ahead. Nicaragua witnessed improvements in chronic malnutrition and total under-
nutrition among children under five years of age. From 1998 to 2011–12, chronic malnutrition
decreased by 8 percentage points and total undernutrition decreased by 15 percentage points.
However, Nicaragua is now reporting a different type of malnutrition: increasing rates of
overweight and obesity, particularly among children and women of reproductive age. The
prevalence of overweight136 among boys and girls under 20 years of age is 15 percent and 23
percent, respectively. Overweight prevalence was much higher among men and women over 20
years of age, at 43 percent and 68 percent, respectively.137 Poor nutrition perpetuates the cycle of
poverty and malnutrition through three main routes: direct losses in productivity from poor
physical status, losses caused by disease linked with malnutrition, and indirect losses from poor
cognitive.

27.     Social protection spending grew in recent years driven by both social assistance and
social insurance spending, although it remains low compared with other countries. World
Bank (2016a) shows that social protection spending grew from 2.4 percent to 4.4 percent of the
GDP between 2007 and 2014, a growth that was above the rest of the Central American countries.

This increment responded both to a rise in social insurance—mostly through the implementation
of a pension reform—and higher social assistance spending. However, social protection spending
in 2014 continued to be relatively low if compared to the rest of the Central American counties;
social protection spending in per capita terms was 124 USD (in 2007 PPP dollars) in 2014,
compared to the Central American average of 416 USD.

28.     Even when social security contributions and pension coverage have increased, both
are low and coverage is unequal. The share of employees 15–65 years old contributing to the
social security system increased by 45 percent in the last ten years from 18 percent in 2005 to 26
percent in 2014.138 However, coverage remains among the lowest in LAC, which is associated with
the relatively high informality of the labor market in Nicaragua. About one in three salary workers
is formal, significantly lower than most LAC countries for which recent labor data is available and
only slightly higher than Guatemala (Figure 4.10, panel a). As result of this relatively high
informality rate, coverage of pensions is low and unequal. The proportion of the elderly who were
covered by pensions more than doubled, increasing from 10 percent in 2005 to 23 percent in 2014.
However, coverage in 2014 was still less than half of the coverage in Costa Rica and Panama, and
the coverage among the better off was more than twice the coverage of the less well off in 2014

29.     Social assistance spending is the lowest of Central America, and programs have
limited coverage and are insufficiently targeted. Social assistance spending as share of GDP
almost doubled from 0.5 to 0.9 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2014, but remains the lowest of
Central America (Figure 4.11). Coverage of social assistance programs has increased in recent
years, with over 40 programs managed by 22 institutions.139 Roughly 70 percent of the population
is covered by at least one of these social assistance programs at the national level. Beneficiaries
include children, women, the elderly and disabled. Coverage is higher in rural areas, among the
less well off, and in the Central and Caribbean regions. However, coverage is generally low for
most programs for which data are available and targeting could be improved significantly. About
13 percent of those in the lowest quintile are not covered by any social assistance program and
none of the programs covered more than 70 percent of the poorest 20 percent (Figure 4.12, panel
a). Costly leakage is also an important problem since about half of beneficiaries did not belong to
the poorest quintiles in 2014 (Figure 4.12, panel b). This suggests that there is room for social
protection spending to support more inclusive household income growth, which might become
increasingly important given the recent trend in income inequality.

                                                     Box 4.3: The Red de Protección Social program
Nicaragua does not have a CCT program today, though it had the Red de Proteccion Social program from
2000 to 2006. The program targeted poor households with children aged 7–13 enrolled in primary school
(grades 1–4) and children aged 0–5 years receiving health care services. The program has been extensively
evaluated and identified as the CCT with the highest impact in terms of increase in consumption and poverty
reduction. A number of indicators improved for household beneficiaries, such as food consumption, school
enrollment, and stunting (Maluccio and Flores 2005). Bustelo (2012) found positive schooling impact on
nontargeted siblings. The program also worked as a social safety net, protecting families affected by the
reduction of prices during the 2001 coffee crisis (Maluccio 2007, Vakis, Kruger, and Mason 2006).
Dammert (2009) found that the program had a higher positive impact on schooling and negative impact on
work on boys compared to girls. Lessons from the program should be taken into consideration when
designing social assistance programs in Nicaragua (World Bank 2016).

  These programs are social care services, family and child benefits, school feeding, education benefits, housing and
emergency benefits, among others.

30.     Overall fiscal policy had a limited redistributive impact, which raises concerns with
respect to the country’s capacity to reduce inequality going forward. A 2014 study shows that
fiscal policy had a modest redistributive impact in LAC countries compared with non-LAC OECD
countries. 140 Like in most of LAC countries—and Central American ones—the redistributive
impact of taxes and public spending has been limited in Nicaragua (Figure 4.13). Most of this
impact in 2009 and 2014 was driven from in-kind government transfers (provision of public
schooling and health). However, the simulated impact of in-kind transfers does not take into
consideration the quality of services provided, which is relatively low in the case of in Nicaragua.
This section suggests that overall fiscal policy is not a key factor behind the relatively low income
inequality in Nicaragua and remains an important instrument for promoting a more inclusive
growth in Nicaragua going forward.

   Box 4.4: What has been the contribution of the overall fiscal policy to low income inequality?

Both government spending and taxes might have a redistributive impact, depending mainly on the
progressivity of fiscal policy and the composition of spending and taxes. To explore the contribution of the
overall fiscal policy to income inequality, the Commitment to Equity Project (CEQ), a joint initiative of
Tulane University and the Inter-American Dialogue, was used. The CEQ is a standardized methodology to
assess the distributional impact of the fiscal policy in LAC countries. The method decomposes fiscal policy
into direct taxes (e.g., income taxes); direct transfers (e.g., noncontributory pensions, and conditional and
unconditional cash transfers); and indirect taxes and transfers (e.g., value added taxes, and fuel subsidies).
The method uses four income concepts. First, Market Income refers to the household income before taxes
and public transfers. Second, Disposable Income subtracts direct income and payroll taxes and adds direct
transfers to Market Income. Third, Post-Fiscal Income adds indirect subsidies and subtracts taxes from
disposable income. Final Income is Post-fiscal income plus in-kind public transfers on health and education
(World Bank 2014).

4.5. Low returns to skills contributed to the low levels of income inequality
31.     Returns to education slightly increased in the last five years, in contrast with the
decline in LAC and in Nicaragua before 2009. There are two elements that can contribute to
labor income inequality (and consequently to total income inequality): (i) the composition and
variance of education and skills, and (ii) the returns to those skills (World Bank 2011). Gindling
and Trejos (2013) and Gasparini et al. (2011) present evidence that the returns to education fell in
Nicaragua before 2005. The first authors find a reduction in the returns to education of about 20
percent between 1998 and 2005, while the second analysis shows a decline of seven percent
between 2001 and 2005. Montenegro and Patrinos (2014) show the evolution of the returns to
education for all LAC countries for which data is available on a regular basis. According to this
study, the returns to education in Nicaragua presented the strongest reduction, where they ended

                                                                                           83
up being the lowest in LAC in 2009. World Bank (2012a) also finds a strong reduction of returns
to education in Nicaragua, with a reduction of 80 percent between 2001 and 2009. Figure 4.14
shows similar trends; the premium for an additional year of education decreased from five percent
in 2005 to 4.5 percent in 2009. This reduction was similar to the LAC region as a whole, where
returns to education decreased from 7.8 percent in 2004 to 7.4 in 2009. However, the education
premium slightly increased to 4.8 percent in 2014 in Nicaragua, while it continued decreasing—
although at a slower pace—in LAC, reaching 7.2 percent in 2014.

32.      Poor quality education and a skill mismatch in the labor market contributed to lower
returns to formal education. As with changes in any price, supply and demand of more educated
individuals translates into changes in the returns to their specific skills. Decreasing returns to
education can be the result of an increasing supply of a more educated workforce, a lower demand
for skills, and/or a lower quality of the education (World Bank 2011). Gasparini et al. (2011) show
that demand for more educated workers decreased in the early 2000s in Nicaragua, leading to a
reduction of the returns to education. World Bank (2016a) and Gindling and Trejos (2013) suggest
that the low quality of education could potentially explain the lower demand for more educated
individuals.141 World Bank (2012, 2016) explains that low returns to education could also be the
result of a mismatch between those skills offered by the formal education system and those
demanded by employers; Nicaraguans do not have the skills to face the labor market demands. A
survey collected in 2016 provided evidence of this skill mismatch; Nicaraguan firms have
problems finding the needed competencies when hiring individuals aged 24 years old or less.142
This survey finds that socio-emotional skills (e.g., honesty, initiative, etc.) are the most relevant
skills required by firms and also the most difficult to find in the Nicaraguan labor market. The
Enterprise Survey (2010) provides similar evidence: more than 61 percent of the firms with
vacancies find soft skills to be the most difficult to find in Nicaragua, compared to 52 percent in

141
    Gindling and Trejos (2013) also suggest that the commodity boom could partially explain an increase in exports of
unskilled labor intensive products which translates into declining returns to education through higher real earnings
among the less educated workers.

33.     Low returns to the education might be the leading factor behind low inequality. The
trend in returns to education shown in Figure 4.14 closely mirror that of the income inequality in
Figure 2.4, which suggests that the education premium is likely to determine inequality of incomes.
Gindling and Trejos (2013) find that a declining education premium was the main driver of the
inequality reduction in Nicaragua before 2005. Similarly, Cord et al. (2016) find evidence that
labor markets also played a key role in reducing inequality between 2005 and 2009; about 80
percent of the fall of income inequality was explained by this source between both years. The
authors found that falling education premia were one of the main factors behind this reduction of
inequality: the returns of tertiary education compared to secondary completed decreased by 6.2
percent on an annual basis between 2005 and 2009. A low education premium might also explain
the relatively low levels of income inequality in the country in a given year. As shown in Figure
4.15, there is a strong correlation between returns to an additional year of education and income
inequality measured by the Gini coefficient; an increment of about five percentage points in the
returns to education would translate into an increment of about ten percent in income inequality in
Nicaragua.143


143
   Analyzing the returns to education is challenging when using household surveys. As discussed in Chapter 2, many
Nicaraguans decide to migrate to other countries and we are not able to observe their incomes. Since migrants tend to
be relatively more educated, migration introduces a problem of selection by creating a downward bias in the estimation
of returns to skills that we cannot address with the information available. Therefore, returns to education would be
higher if incomes of migrants were captured in household surveys. For this reason, our results should be interpreted
with caution.

      Knowledge Gap: What are the main constraints that impede women to enter the labor force?

 Nicaragua ranks among the countries with the lowest female labor force participation. Given the
 importance of women participation in the labor force for poverty reduction and economic growth, it is
 crucial to fully understand the main drivers of lower labor force participation in the country.

                       Box 4.5: Uneven progress in reducing gender disparities144

Nicaragua has witnessed important progress in terms of reducing gender disparities; however progress has
been uneven and many outcomes are still different between men and women. This box presents the main
gender disparities focusing on the following five outcomes: (i) economic opportunities; (ii) health and
teenage pregnancy; (iii) gender-based violence; (iv) political participation; and (v) entrepreneurship.

Economic opportunities
There has been an improvement in the participation of women in the labor market, yet it remains one of the
lowest in LAC. Gender equality in the labor market is crucial for development, poverty and inequality
reduction, and economic growth.145 Like most of the countries in LAC, women participation in the labor
market has increased in the last ten years. However, Nicaragua still lags behind other countries in LAC: in
2014, only half of women aged 15–64 were in the labor market, the lowest proportion after Honduras (45
percent) and Mexico (48 percent) and significantly lower than LAC’s average (55 percent). Education is an
important driver of low female labor force participation, with the gap between men and women narrowing
at higher levels of education. Women are also lagging their male peers in terms of unemployment: in 2014,
women’s unemployment rate was 6.7 percent higher than the one for men. Low quality of women's jobs
and employment vulnerability are also of concern. Women are more likely to work informally and under
vulnerable conditions. About 56 percent of women are working in a vulnerable employment—defined as
the ratio between unpaid family workers and own-account workers over total employment—compared to
41 percent of males. Furthermore, women tend to earn less than their male counterparts when they manage
to work in formal employment. In 2014, women’s monthly income was 78 percent the income earned by
males. This gap was mainly the result of fewer hours of work: Nicaragua together with Argentina had the
highest proportion of women working part-time (about 35 percent).
Reproductive health and teen pregnancy
Despite progress, maternal mortality is still high and there are marked regional differences in terms of
prenatal care and contraceptive use. A World Bank (2012b) study finds evidence of a link between teenage
pregnancy and poverty, rural residence, higher maternal mortality, and lower secondary completion rates
among teen mothers in LAC, as well as the long-term impact on the child, for instance through higher rates
of sexual activity. Nicaragua has made important progress on reproductive health indicators likely due to
increase in health services, maternity facilities for high-risk pregnancies, and medical staff. Maternal
mortality has decreased while prenatal care and contraceptive use has increased. Still, the rate of maternal
mortality is high compared with the regional average: 150 deaths per 100,000 live births in Nicaragua vs.
67 deaths per 100,000 live births in LAC. In addition, important regional differences remain regarding
prenatal care and contraceptive use within the country. Some departments have almost universal coverage
of prenatal medical attention for pregnant women, while less than 87 percent of women can make use of
these services in Región Autónoma de la Costa Caribe (RAAN) and Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur
(RAAS) regions. Similarly, contraceptive use also varies across regions: contraceptive prevalence is less
than 77 percent in RAAS and RAAN regions compared with 80 percent at the national level.

   Gasparini and Marchionni (2015), World Bank (2012b), Loko and Diouf (2009), and Daly (2007). This last study
finds important implications for growth: closing the employment gap between male and female would translate into
an increment of GDP growth of nine percent in the US, 13 percent in the Eurozone, and 16 percent in Japan.

                     Box 4.5: Uneven progress in reducing gender disparities, continued

Adolescent childbearing also remains high compared with LAC. Teenage childbearing has important
consequences for development and growth as it is highly associated with school dropout, poorer labor
outcomes, and poverty. Adolescent fertility rate has decreased significantly in Nicaragua in the last 15
years, with a reduction of about 24 percent in the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 years old,
decreasing from 118 in 2000 to 90 in 2014. Still, Nicaragua stands out as one of the countries with the
highest adolescent fertility rate in LAC in 2014, surpassed only by the Dominican Republic (98). Gender
norms and inequalities play an important role in shaping young women’s fertility outcomes, and many girls
lack the agency to control decisions pertaining to sexual relations and contraceptive use. 146 Teenage
childbearing is closely correlated with early marriage and the age of sexual initiation, which decreased from
17.4 years in 2006/7 to 16.8 in 2011/12.

Gender-based violence
Gender-based violence has decreased slightly though it continues to be a serious concern in Nicaragua.
Violence against women has serious repercussions in terms of agency and presents limitations to women’s
empowerment. In addition, it also has important implications in terms of economic growth, through lower
labor productivity. The proportion of women who declared being beaten or physically abused at some point
in life is relatively high in Nicaragua. In 2007, 27 percent of women declared being physically abused by
their partners, an average higher than many LAC countries for which data is available.

Political participation
Nicaragua is among the best performers in terms of female political participation in the region. The LAC
region has witnessed important gains in terms of women’s representation in national parliaments and in
ministerial positions and Nicaragua stands up in both indicators. The country has shown important progress
in the last seven years and is among the countries with the highest proportions in both dimensions. The
proportion of women in ministerial level positions increased more than 40 percent from 33 percent in 2008
to 47 percent in 2015; being the highest proportion in LAC. Similarly, the proportion of seats held by
women in national parliaments has more than doubled from 18 percent in 2008 to 41 percent in 2015, being
the highest in the region after Ecuador (42 percent) and Mexico (42 percent). At the local level, the country
has also the highest share of women among mayors; 40 percent of mayors were women in 2014.

Entrepreneurship
Nicaragua is the best performer in terms of female participation in firm’s ownership and on firm’s top
management. The LAC region in general presents relatively high levels of female entrepreneurship, and
Nicaragua performs better than any other country in the region. Six out of ten firms had female participation
in ownership in 2010, significantly higher than the rest of the LAC countries. Similarly, one-third of firms
had a woman in top management that year, also significantly higher than most of the countries in the region.
However, both leadership and ownership tends to be concentrated in small firms.

5. SUSTAINABILITY
Addressing Nicaragua’s large external vulnerabilities, strengthening the financial sustainability
of the INSS and reducing the vulnerability to shocks and climate change are among some of the
most critical issues to continue making progress toward the twin goals. These efforts would need
to be supported, as a precondition, by macroeconomic stability and prudent fiscal policies.
Gradually moving away from an energy matrix that is intensive in non-renewables would reduce
external vulnerabilities, the associated volatility in electricity tariffs, and mitigate the potential
fiscal impact associated with energy subsidies should a renewed surge in international oil prices
occur. Demographic changes are expected to further strain the finances of the INSS, which if left
unaddressed, could potentially result in a drain of fiscal resources. Natural disasters, climate
change, and mismanagement of natural resources remain at the center of Nicaragua’s
developmental agenda. These issues are compounded by the high concentration of poverty in rural
areas (especially along the Dry Corridor), rapid unplanned urbanization, and the importance of
the agriculture sector in Nicaragua.

5.1. Maintaining macroeconomic stability and prudent fiscal policies
1.     Strong economic growth and progress toward the twin goals over the past decade
were supported by a stable macro policy framework and favorable external conditions. The
country applied prudent fiscal and monetary policies which resulted in declining public debt-to-
GDP ratios and inflation rates consistent with the rate of devaluation of the crawling peg regime.
These policies were supported by favorable external factors, such as strong remittances and FDI
flows. Household data suggest that a key driver of the observed gains in poverty reduction was
labor income in agriculture, in particular, through increases in labor earnings rather than
employment. This suggests that cyclical factors rather than structural policies were among the
main drivers behind the recent progress toward the twin goals. This underlines the fragility of such
gains to changes in the external environment while maintaining a stable macroeconomic
framework.

2.      This underscores the need to continue Nicaragua’s commitment to macroeconomic
stability and fiscal sustainability in order to promote growth, reduce poverty, and foster
shared prosperity. A recent debt sustainability analysis suggests that there are no immediate risks
of debt distress (IMF 2016). The assessment supports that Nicaragua remains at moderate risk of
external debt distress, underpinned by the concessional and long-term nature of most of the
government’s external borrowing and the country’s prudent track record of macroeconomic
management. 147 Exchange rate policy management has been predictable, providing a nominal
anchor for the economy and helping achieve price stability, against the backdrop of a highly
dollarized economy.148 In addition, the real effective exchange rate seems to be broadly in line with
fundamentals (IMF 2016).The current fiscal position remains sound, with manageable overall
fiscal deficits averaging 0.8 percent of GDP and primary surpluses averaging 0.2 percent over

147
    Risks factors include the magnitude of private external debt together with the quasi-fiscal nature of some share of
this debt and the likelihood that some projects and programs currently funded by resources from Venezuela’s oil
cooperation to end up being absorbed into the budget. For instance, since 2014, the authorities incorporated a wage
supplement (“Bono Cristiano, Socialista y Solidario”) into the budget.
148
    The country maintains a crawling peg exchange rate regime, with the preannounced rate of devaluation of 5 percent,
which has been maintained since 2004.

2010–15. Building up fiscal buffers would strengthen the capacity of the government to respond
to external shocks.

3.       One area that could potentially help generate fiscal buffers is the rationalization of
tax expenditures, which could bring additional resources to the government. Nicaragua has
been relatively successful in mobilizing revenues compared to other Central American countries,
yet tax expenditures limit the availability of a significant amount of fiscal resources. Tax
collections have been gradually growing after the global financial crisis (from 14.4 percent in 2010
to 16.4 percent in 2015) helped by improving economic conditions, efforts to strengthen the tax
administration and changes in its tax code. Nicaragua has undertaken a series of tax reforms in the
recent past, which had a positive impact on fiscal revenues.149 However, additional changes to the
tax code were introduced in 2014 that backtracked some of the reductions in tax exemptions and
exonerations envisaged in the 2012 tax reform (IMF 2016). A study by Pecho et al (2012)
estimated that tax expenditures in Nicaragua amounted to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2010, 88 percent
of which corresponded to Value-Added Tax exonerations and exemptions.150 These are forgone
fiscal resources that could have been otherwise used to either build fiscal buffers in the eventuality
of a shock or increasing social expenditures and public investment to address existing gaps in key
areas such as education.

          Concertación Tributaria and subsequent changes) in terms of tax expenditures?

 Pecho, Peláez, and Sánchez (2012) estimated the magnitude of tax expenditures at 7.6 percent of GDP
 in 2010, prior to the recent changes introduced in the tax code.

5.2. Addressing Nicaragua’s large external vulnerabilities
4.      Nicaragua has been running large current account deficits, averaging 9.7 percent of
GDP over 2010–15. The country is a net importer of oil, which accounts for a large share of its
trade deficits (21.6 percent in 2015). Oil imports, including crude oil, fuels and lubricants,
amounted to 6.1 percent of GDP in 2015. A steady inflow of workers’ remittances, averaging about
9.6 percent of GDP over 2010–15, has helped offset the trade deficits.

5.     Reducing the country’s external vulnerabilities arising from the financing of large
current account deficits remains one of the key priorities. The current account balance has been
financed by FDI flows and other investment (Figure 5.1.a). FDI flows averaged about 6.8 percent
of GDP between 2010 and 2015. Nicaragua’s oil collaboration with Venezuela under the ALBA
Collaboration Agreements (see Box 5.1), has helped finance these large current account deficits
since 2007 (Figure 5.1.b). These exceptional flows from Venezuela averaged about $540mn
between 2010 and 2014 (or 5.3 percent of GDP), but declined to just $298mn and $92.8mn in 2015
and 2016 (or 2.3 and 0.7 percent of GDP, respectively) largely due to the progressive deterioration
of Venezuela’s economic situation. While lower oil prices in recent years have temporarily

    These tax reforms included the 2009 Law 712 (Ley de Equidad Fiscal) and the 2012 Law 822 (Ley de Concertación
Tributaria). Law 712 broadened the income tax base to include capital income and eliminated exemptions in excise
taxes, whereas Law 822’s goal was to address structural deficiencies in the tax system (IMF 2016) .
150
    Nicaragua had the second highest level of tax expenditures in the LAC region (second only to Guatemala).

reduced vulnerabilities on the external side, the decline in Venezuela’s oil cooperation financing
and potential oil price increases in the near- to medium-term pose significant risks to the outlook.151

6.       Nicaragua has taken important steps to address those external vulnerabilities. Since
the power crisis in the mid-2000s, progress has been achieved on several fronts by: a) adjusting
tariffs to better reflect actual generation costs, while temporarily subsidizing consumption of
disadvantaged neighborhoods; b) reducing nontechnical losses; c) strengthening the legal
framework to penalize electricity theft; and d) shifting the composition of the electricity generation
matrix towards renewables (IMF 2012).

7.      Moving away from fossil fuels toward a more diversified electricity matrix is key to
ensure a sustainable sector from both environmental and economic perspectives. Electricity
demand in Nicaragua is projected to increase by 72 percent from 2014 to 2027, at an average pace
of 4 percent per year. The World Bank has supported the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM)
in conducting a power system optimization study in 2015–2016, to inform future generation
expansion plans. According to this study Nicaragua could potentially meet 96 percent of its
generation needs in 2027 using renewable energy technologies, resulting in lower power
generation costs, electricity prices, less dependency on imported fuels, and significant greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions reductions—the energy sector being one of the main contributors to GHG
emissions. However, the capital cost of achieving this optimal solution doubles the business as
usual scenario. Access to global climate funds and the setup of a favorable regulatory framework
and business environment to attract private sector investment are key to address funding gaps for
the addition of sustainable generation capacity.

   Under the oil cooperation agreement, Nicaragua purchases oil at market prices with 50 percent of the oil bill paid
upfront and the remainder over 25 years (including a two-year grace period) at an interest rate of 2 percent. In 2016,
the share of financing of the oil bill was reduced to 25 percent. The Debt Sustainability Analysis Update in the 2015
Article IV Consultation for Nicaragua (IMF 2016) indicates that “the authorities reiterated that the debt owned by
ALBANISA and CARUNA to PDVSA is private and that staff welcomes that the government’s policy is neither to
absorb nor to extend public guarantees on this debt.”

                                                                        90
                               Box 5.1: Venezuela’s oil cooperation scheme

Nicaragua’s oil collaboration with Venezuela was agreed by Presidents Ortega and Chavez in April 2007.
The collaboration is based on a broad framework for oil import-related financing as well as other financing
(e.g., FDI) and debt servicing schemes (through in-kind repayments). The scheme works as follows:




 PDVSA, a Venezuelan state-owned oil company, is Venezuela’s representative under the agreement. It
  supplies petroleum and is a financial agent for FDI and other arrangements in Nicaragua.
 ALBANISA (ALBA de Nicaragua) was created in 2008 and is owned by PDVSA (51 percent) and
  PETRONIC (a Nicaraguan state-owned company; 49 percent). ALBANISA imports oil from PDVSA
  which is subsequently sold in Nicaragua at market prices. It also serves as Venezuela’s agent in FDI in
  various sectors in Nicaragua’s economy. Under the agreement, 100 percent of the oil bill is paid by
  ALBANISA to PDVSA within 90 days. On behalf of PDVSA, 50 percent of the oil bill (FOB) is then
  transferred to CARUNA (Caja Rural Nacional), a privately owned Nicaraguan financial cooperative, in
  the form of a long-term loan (payable over 25 years, with a 2-year grace period, 2 percent interest, and
  grant element of 30 percent).
 Under the oil collaboration scheme, 38 percent of the funds received by CARUNA are used for quasi-
  fiscal operations (e.g., subsidies and transfers for electricity and transport, and public sector wage
  bonuses). The remaining 62 percent is used to finance for-profit projects.
 Payments to PDVSA for oil or the debt service on oil financing can be made in cash or in kind. The
  latter can take place only through exports of goods by ALBALINISA (ALBA Alimentos de Nicaragua),
  a joint venture between ALBANISA and PDVSA, to Venezuela. ALBALINISA purchases primary
  products (e.g., cattle, beef, sugar, coffee, and beans) from domestic private firms and re-sells these to
  retail chains in Venezuela.
Changes in the administration of the oil collaboration scheme were reported (IMF 2016): (i) at the request
of the government of Venezuela, all assets and liabilities associated with the oil cooperation scheme are in
the process of being transferred from a private financial cooperative (CARUNA) to ALBANISA. The
government’s current policy is not to extend public guarantees on any of the associated liabilities; and (ii)
the number of barrels per day that can be imported under the oil collaboration was increased in 2013 from
27,000 to 30,000, and represented external financing of 2.7 percent of GDP in 2015 (5.2 percent in 2014).

8.       A diversified electricity matrix would also improve fiscal sustainability by containing
government subsidies and lowering volatility of tariffs that accrue the volatility of oil prices.
Electricity produced oil and diesel fell from 67 percent in 2010, but it still accounted for 54 percent
of total installed capacity in 2015 (Figure 5.2.a).152 Progress in strengthening the electricity sector
has also contributed to reducing a source of fiscal vulnerability. The fiscal cost of electricity
subsidies is estimated at about one-and-one-fourth percent of GDP in 2015, of which consumption-
based electricity subsidies account for about two-thirds of the total cost of electricity subsidies
(IMF 2016). The fiscal cost of electricity subsidies in Nicaragua was the highest among Central
American countries in 2012–15, amounting to 1.6% of GDP on average. While electricity
subsidies do make electricity more affordable for lower-income households, they do it at the cost
of inefficient targeting (Figure 5.2.b). It is estimated that only 23.5 percent of subsidies were
received by households in the bottom 40 percent of the distribution (Hernández Oré, Sánchez,
Sousa and Tornarolli, 2017).

noncontributory and contributory pension regimes. The noncontributory pension system assists

the average emission factor of the other grids in the region. Relevant improvements can be achieved by the renewal
of the generation park and the diversification of the generation mix.

10.     A parametric reform was introduced in 2014 to address the sustainability of the INSS.
The reform included a phased-in increase in employers’ contributions and linking pension
increases to increases in the average wage. Other measures included a reduction in old age and
disability pension benefits for those making over two minimum wages. The introduction of a
“reduced pension” in 2013 and a subsequent legislated increase in these pensions in 2015, and
higher than budgeted expenditures on health services, capital goods, and administration offset the
impact of the enacted parametric changes.155 Since 2013, the INSS has been running increasingly
larger deficits (about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2016). While social contributions (total revenues) have
increased from about 3.5 (3.8) percent of GDP in 2006 to 5.3 (5.5) percent of GDP in 2015, total
expenditure grew at a faster pace, increasing from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2005 to 5.8 of GDP in
2015 (Figure 5.4). A recent assessment (IMF 2016) suggests that the INSS is projected to start
running persistent deficits by 2017, and the reserve fund to be depleted by 2024.


11.     Limited coverage of the labor force due to high levels of informality in labor markets
and ongoing changes in demographic trends pose important challenges to the system. Only
29.2 percent of the total employed population was covered by social security in 2016. Moreover,
the ratio of employees contributing to the system versus pensioners has been on the decline: 4.4
employees were supporting a pensioner in 2016, down from 5.7 in 2008. Falling fertility rates and

154
    Replacement rate is 100 percent for minimum wage workers, declining to 80 percent for the highest wage workers
if they have contributed for the minimum of 15 years. The share of employees contributing to the system has increased
over time, from 18 percent in 2001 to 26 percent in 2014. The share of the elderly that benefit from social security has
also increased, from less than 10 percent in 2001 to 24 percent in 2014 (EMNV 2001, 2014).
155
    Decree No. 28 extended pension coverage to INSS members who accumulated between 250 and 749 weeks of
contributions. Previously, a minimum of 750 weeks of contributions was required to be eligible for an old age pension.

increasing life expectancy of the general population are expected to continue exerting pressure into
the system. Following Jacobsen and Jensen (2014) for the case of Nicaragua, baseline projections
show that changes in the demographic structure of the population would result in a decline in
expenditures in education and an increase in health care spending. The largest projected increase
corresponds to pension expenditures. Increases in social security contributions are also projected
to increase but this variation only is forecast to offset about 24 percent of the increase by 2045.156

5.4. Environment
12.     Environmental issues are at the center of Nicaragua’s developmental agenda. If left
unaddressed, they are likely to result in the reversal of the many gains achieved in poverty
reduction and shared prosperity during recent years. This is particularly important due to the
country’s high exposure to natural hazards, the high concentration of poverty in rural areas, and
the impact of climate change on water resources and agriculture. In addition, Nicaragua’s capacity
to promote sustainable growth depends heavily on how well its natural resources (soil, water, and
forests) are managed. This is critical in view of the growing and competing demand for these
resources and the fact that their supply is becoming more limited and less reliable. Climate change
and more frequent natural disasters, together with poorly managed natural resources, are putting
pressure on ecosystems, impacting their potential to support growth in the medium and long-term.

Reducing vulnerability to shocks and climate change
13.     Nicaragua is highly exposed to natural hazards, including hurricanes and tropical
storms, droughts, seismic and volcanic activity. In terms of long-term climate risk the country
ranks 4th among 177 countries most affected by extreme weather events worldwide.157 Hydro-
meteorological events are the highest threat in the northern Caribbean coast, while floods and
landslides are recurrent in the Pacific and Central regions, generating localized impacts of high
frequency. Drought risks are concentrated across the Dry Corridor (or Corredor Seco), which
covers about 28 percent of Nicaragua’s territory and pose significant risks to water and food

security. Seismic activity could potentially lead to major catastrophic impacts involving high
mortality and asset loss. Six of the country’s volcanoes are considered active and are situated in
the Pacific region, precisely where the larger cities are located.

14.     Extreme weather events and seismic activity threaten human and physical capital.
Hurricane Mitch (1998), Hurricane Felix (2007), and Tropical Depression 12E (2011), the three
more recent extreme weather events, affected a total of 1.2 million people,158 including more than
3,500 deaths (95 percent of which were due to Hurricane Mitch). Economic losses caused by the
three events amounted to 22 percent, 11 percent and 5 percent of GDP, respectively (Figure 5.5).
The damages and losses resulting from the 1972 earthquake that struck the city of Managua alone
equal the sum of all damages and losses from hydro-meteorological events for the 1980–2011
period. The earthquake affected an area of approximately 27 square kilometers and destroyed at
least 50 percent of all existing buildings. The event killed about 6,000 people, injuring about
20,000 others. Total losses were estimated at 93 percent of GDP for the previous year.159

15.    Nicaragua’s rapid urbanization, paired with absence of urban planning, are also
factors contributing to increased vulnerability to disasters. Nicaragua’s urban population was
estimated at 58.5 percent of total population in 2014, and has been growing at a rate of 1.96 percent
per year from 2010 to 2015 on average.161 Limited economic opportunities and rising urbanization
without proper planning (including the inability to update and enforce building codes) have led to
the proliferation of precarious settlements in areas that are exposed to different natural hazards
with no access to quality housing. Available data suggest that approximately 45 percent of the
population lives in slums.162 Certain building characteristics prevalent in poor areas tend to be less

resilient, increasing the level of vulnerability to natural disasters. For example, the presence of
adobe, wood, and mud-walled buildings increase the risk of urban areas to disasters such as
earthquakes and hurricanes. 163 Particularly, single-family, residential houses constructed with
reinforced masonry bearing walls—prevalent in Nicaragua—are the buildings most vulnerable to
earthquakes.164

16.     Frequent climatic shocks result in sizable production losses in agriculture. Agriculture
in Nicaragua is subject to frequent climatic shocks produced by excessive precipitation (hurricanes
and tropical depressions) and droughts of varying intensities, sometime associated with the El Niño
Southern Oscillation. Total agricultural production losses due to unmanaged production risks—in
area planted and due to declines in yield for basic grains and export crops—were estimated at
about USD 107 million annually (or 6.1 percent of agricultural GDP) between 1994–2013. The
most significant factor is the erratic distribution of precipitation during the planting season, which
directly impacts the area planted. The regions most affected—as a percentage of area lost by crop
in each region—are generally considered part of the Dry Corridor. Reduced performance of the
area harvested has also resulted in average annual losses estimated at USD 8.4 million. This decline
is caused by risk events that happen during crop development, and happens when the rainy season
arrives late or is erratic, which forces producers, already under increased economic constraints, to
replant, using poorer quality seeds with consequent reductions in yield. Severe droughts and to a
lesser extent pests and diseases are the main causes of yield variability for export crops.165

17.     Risks arising from climate change are exacerbated by deforestation, land
degradation, and the spatial distribution of natural resources relative to where they are
needed. Forest cover is decreasing mainly due to a rapid expansion of the agricultural frontier into
areas not suitable for agricultural practices. This expansion as well as unsustainable land use
practices have caused the degradation of soil over time, also negatively affecting water retention.
In addition, historically, agricultural activity in Nicaragua was concentrated in the Pacific and the
Dry Corridor, areas that have always been at the lower end of water availability for intensive
agriculture. With more extreme and erratic patterns of rainfall variation caused by climate change
those challenges are becoming more pressing.

18.     Deforestation is caused by the rapid expansion of the agricultural frontier. While still
about 26 percent of the national territory covered by forests (about 3,398,000 hectares), current
unsustainable land and forest management practices have increased deforestation and biodiversity
loss (Figure 5.6). About 72,500 hectares of forests are lost in Nicaragua every year.166 Declared
protected areas have not been immune from forest loss. In 2016, more than a dozen protected areas
experienced deforestation and conversion into pastures or agriculture land. Main drivers of
deforestation have been the expansion of agriculture and cattle ranching. Other factors contributing

19.     Land degradation and soil erosion is threatening the sustainability of the current
growth path. Soil loss negatively affects fertility and lowers agricultural production. The major
on-site effect of erosion is a decline in soil productivity (Alfsen et al., 1996), resulting in declining
production in the agricultural sector. Soil erosion and acidification is affecting different regions in
the Pacific and the Caribbean.168 The acidity of the soil blocks the functioning and capturing of
some nutrients, affecting plants’ development. This issue has been reinforced in recent years by
rapid deforestation and heavy rainfall. Sustainable forest and landscape management is needed
(including community-based programs). Pressure from the expansion of the agriculture and
livestock frontier can be addressed by promoting silvopastoral and agroforestry systems.

20.     Despite the country’s rich water resources, Nicaragua faces challenges from the
spatial and seasonal distribution of its resources. With average annual water availability of
some 27,059 cubic meters/year, Nicaragua is far above water stress levels.169 Nevertheless, this
apparent abundance masks important spatial considerations, as 87 percent of the population resides
along the Dry Corridor in the Pacific and Central regions of the country, while some three-quarters
of all water resources are situated in the Atlantic region. Cyclical droughts aggravate water stress

in already dry areas.170 Uneven spatial distribution, coupled with a strong seasonal variability (90
percent of the precipitation is concentrated from May to November) and the lack of hydraulic
storage infrastructure, result in a fragile water balance in the most densely populated regions during
the dryer months (between February and April). In addition, groundwater resources, which are the
main source of water supply for 80 percent of the population,171 have started to show signs of
overexploitation in recent years.

21.     Increasing competing usages over water resources, water quality deterioration and
climate change are expected to impact economic activities that rely on these resources. Main
pressures on water resources will result from: (i) agricultural expansion; (ii) increase in the
hydropower generation (expected to double by 2030); and (iii) population growth. These drivers,
together with the current deterioration of water quality and climate change, are expected to put
more stress on water availability.172 Water quality is deteriorating due to poor sanitation coverage
and service, resulting in untreated discharges of wastewater. Sanitation treatment infrastructure for
domestic wastewater is essentially nonexistent in rural areas, and latrines employed in rural areas
often suffer from poor sewage disposal. Mining activity also contributes to the pollution of rivers
and aquifers. Surface waters across various parts of the country show elevated levels of arsenic
and other pollutants, especially in urban areas.173 Improving the management of water resources to
secure current and future demands will call for smart investments in water storage facilities,
aqueducts, and reforestation, along with effective water resources management, institutional
strengthening and local-level capacity building.

Natural resources and climate change and their impact on poverty reduction
22.     Natural hazards and climate change could jeopardize poverty reduction efforts. The
populations located in the dry corridor, in particular in the departments of Madriz, Nueva Segovia,
Matagalpa and Chinandega, are highly exposed to hydrometeorological events, including droughts
and floods, not only having their lives at risk but also their livelihood. Municipalities with higher
than national average poverty levels are located in the dry corridor and it is estimated that 25
percent of the population of the dry corridor (approximately 650,000 people) live with two or more
unsatisfied basic needs.174

23.    Poverty in Nicaragua is exacerbated by the country’s exposition to the above
described weather related shocks and natural hazards, and by the absence of an effective
safety net. 175 Recurrent climate events (floods or landslides), including low-intensity long
duration events (droughts) will have cumulative impacts in the long run that will eventually

170
    A climate change impact assessment suggests that water availability (projected water balance, measured as the
difference between precipitation and actual evapo-transpiration), will likely decrease in most of Nicaragua’s basins
(Cestti et al., 2013).

    The lack of an effective social program that protects Nicaraguans households from the negative impacts of
aggregate shocks and natural disasters might be limiting the capacity of the country to continue reducing poverty. The
Red de Proteccion Social (RPS) program, which functioned as a social safety net against the negative consequences
of shocks, protected Nicaraguan households from reducing consumption during the 2001 coffee crisis (Maluccio
(2007), Vakis, Kruger, and Mason (2006)).

intensify poverty conditions, in particular those households that rely heavily on agricultural
income.176 These climatic shocks affect upward income mobility and tend to perpetuate poverty.
A recent study shows that a drought in 1997–1998 and scarce rains in July 2004 increased the
likelihood that poor households remain at the bottom of the distribution by ten percent in
Nicaragua.177 Exposure to climate shocks can have an impact on child development and perpetuate
poverty across generations through a reduction in human capital accumulation. For instance,
children affected by Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in 1998 were 8.7 percentage points more likely
to be malnourished two years after the shock,178 and child labor was more prevalent as a result of
the storm in rural areas of the country.179

24.     Certain social groups already experiencing high poverty levels, such as indigenous
communities, may be more vulnerable to the impact of disasters. Hurricane Felix’s effects
were overwhelmingly felt by communities in the Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte (RAAN),
one of the regions with the highest incidences of poverty and malnutrition and lowest levels of
education and health in Nicaragua. Cayos Miskitos, a unique marine ecosystem that ensured food
security and the economic livelihoods for roughly 30 indigenous communities on the Northern
Coast of the RAAN, was particularly hit at the time of the event.

25.     Managing water resources and natural capital in a sustainable manner are key
challenges to solidify recent gains achieved in poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
Renewable natural capital—whether it is fish stocks, forests, or fertile soil for agricultural land—
represents key assets to support economic growth and poverty reduction efforts in a sustainable
manner. Forests support the livelihoods of an important share of Nicaragua’s population by
providing food, fuelwood, and other resources. Forests also protect at least 21 watersheds of high
socioeconomic relevance. Fisheries are an important economic activity for coastal communities.
Land, on the other hand, is a key input of production given the important role played by the
agriculture and livestock in Nicaragua. It is also a key asset for the livelihood of rural households.
Deforestation, soil degradation and biodiversity loss can have a negative impact on the livelihoods
of the poor and vulnerable.

26.     Practices aimed at building the resilience of agricultural and forestry systems are not
new to Nicaragua. Nevertheless, due to the urgency to manage interannual weather shocks
and the need to adapt to climate change, large-scale implementation of these practices must
take place. This could be achieved by fostering Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) activities, that
could strengthen resilience of agricultural systems through: (i) promulgating practices in cattle
raising with regard to conservation of forage and creation of protein banks of leguminous shrubs
and leguminous hay varieties, along with energy banks of sugarcane; (ii) promoting elimination of
open burning of waste in basic grain production and the use of green fertilizers, Rhizobium, and
improved seed varieties. Leasing and sharecropping contracts must contain clauses ensuring the
protection of natural resources in keeping with national legislation; (iii) introducing programs
incorporating silvopastoral and agroforestry systems. Silvopastoral and agroforestry systems have

proven themselves to be key with regard to environmental restoration and food security, and will
contribute significantly in adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change; (iv)
developing and promulgating an action plan with defined roles and goals for the agriculture sector
to adapt to climate change. The objective is to ensure operational collaboration among public
institutions and to align their activities with the various initiatives carried out by NGOs; and (v)
facilitating transfer of technology and financial assistance to producers is vital, particularly in hard-
hit areas of the dry corridor of Nicaragua.

                       Box 5.2: Reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience

To reduce Nicaragua’s vulnerability and build resilience, the country should address the following four
main challenges.

Improving disaster risk knowledge for better Early Warning Systems. Existing climate and
hydrometeorological services face various technical and financial constraints and the country’s
understanding of environmental, social and economic impacts associated to extreme weather and climate
events is still limited. Preliminary assessments have highlighted that the Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios
Territoriales (INETER), the entity responsible for hydrometeorological services, as well as other agencies
involved are facing significant challenges in terms of data management capacities, equipment, human
resources, technical skills and overall budget sustainability. In particular, it has been highlighted that the
overall meteorological station network, where available, requires consistent upgrade, maintenance and
update. Moreover data treatment and analysis need to be improved through capacity building and training
in the area of meteorology, agrometeorology, statistics, climate change, information technology, risk
analysis and management.

Improving disaster risk knowledge for better land use planning and disaster risk reduction investments.
To reduce Nicaragua’s vulnerability and build resilience, the development process at the national and
subnational levels needs to be informed by sound disaster risk knowledge. Municipalities would need to
develop local vulnerability and hazard profiles to identify and implement risk reduction policies, including
building codes and inform local land use plans. The absence of the necessary technical and financial
resources for the development of local disaster risk assessments (including models, maps, and indexes)
poses a real challenge. Enhanced disaster risk knowledge will also allow Nicaragua to invest in disaster risk
mitigation measures, including (i) retrofitting of critical infrastructure and buildings, such as schools,
hospitals, roads, and cultural heritage sites, (ii) housing improvements, and (ii) human settlement relocation
from high risk areas to safer locations.

Financial protection against disaster risk. To ensure the sustainability of Nicaragua’s economic growth
and protect the country against economic losses due to disasters, the country needs to develop a
comprehensive financial protection strategy based on sound analytical knowledge, including the
quantification of contingent liabilities, and the assessment of adequate reserve funds.

Social protection and safety nets can support long-term adaptation to changing risks. In Nicaragua, the
Red de Protección Social cash transfer scheme significantly helped beneficiary households recover in the
aftermath of the 2000–2001 “coffee crisis” (coffee price decline) and also helped coffee laborers implement
alternative agricultural activities even before the crisis (Maluccio 2005). This type of approach, which
focuses on disaster risk prone areas, could help reducing both physical vulnerability levels and poverty
rates.

6. PRIORITY AREAS
This SCD has identified the following set of priority areas for policy action:(i) education, skills,
and job outcomes for the youth, (ii) provision of infrastructure (transport, energy, and water) and
public service delivery, (iii) improvements in private sector productivity and investment climate,
(iv) reduction of vulnerabilities from climate change and management of natural resources (water,
forestry, and land), and (v) reduction of external vulnerabilities. The cross-cutting theme is
strengthening institutions and the capacity of the public sector. While areas (i)–(iii) refer to
changes that can have positive impacts on growth and the twin goals, areas (iv)–(v) are critical
for the sustainability of the growth path, which are needed to avoid any negative externalities and
consequences associated with the selected path. The cross-cutting theme is key to enable progress
in the other areas. The priority areas have been identified as most critical for improving the
current growth trajectory, reducing poverty and increasing inclusion, while safeguarding the
sustainability of the development path based on cross-country benchmarking, analytical work, and
country knowledge.

1.      The objective of the prioritization process is to identify the most critical factors that
constrain or drive growth, inclusion, and sustainability. Improvements in the identified areas
would help lift the current growth trajectory and ensure poverty reduction and inclusion, while
safeguarding the sustainability of such a growth path. This is particularly important given
Nicaragua’s many development challenges despite its remarkable economic turnaround since the
mid-1990s. The country has significant upside potential for growth and to accelerate progress
toward poverty reduction and inclusion. Faster growth is needed to lift the standards of living of
the large share of the population that still lives below the official poverty line and secure the gains
achieved in recent years, in particular for those segments of the population that remain at risk of
falling back into poverty.

2.      The prioritization is based on the diagnostic presented in the previous chapters and
relies on cross-country benchmarking, analytical work, and country knowledge. The previous
chapters rely on cross-country benchmarking of various aspects of Nicaragua’s development
model, findings from existing literature, as well as analytical work carried out on growth, poverty
and inclusion. Moreover, the findings were validated on the basis of country knowledge. During
the preparation of the diagnostics, the World Bank undertook consultations with country
stakeholders in Nicaragua to validate the identified priority areas. In addition, the prioritization
benefited from the deep country knowledge within the World Bank through various interactions
with World Bank Group staff, including a prioritization workshop.

3.     Three selection criteria served to narrow down the most critical priority areas. First,
improvements in the selected area would lead to a significant impact on poverty and shared
prosperity. Second, identified changes and policy actions would generate synergies and
complementarities. Third, improvements in a given area would be critical to sustain achieved gains
toward the twin goals.

6.1. Emerging priority areas
4.     The analysis in this report supports the conclusion that a growth model that relies on
higher factor accumulation can still accelerate and sustain growth going forward. There is

                                                 101
ample room to improve the process of factor accumulation in Nicaragua to generate faster
economic growth. Despite recent progress, education still suffers from significant shortcomings
(e.g., high dropout rates, large rural/urban inequities, low teacher qualifications, etc.). There is also
a significant skills mismatch between the skills that the education system provides and those that
the private sector demands. Addressing these challenges to take advantage of the favorable
demographic transition has therefore been identified as a priority area. The country also faces
significant infrastructure gaps: its roads are among the least developed in LAC; water is unevenly
distributed and polluted; and electricity prices are among the highest in LAC. Investments in roads,
electricity, and water storage will enhance competitiveness and reduce regional disparities.
Furthermore, access to basic opportunities and services (i.e., electricity, water, and sanitation) is
among the lowest and most unequally distributed in the region. Addressing this low and unequal
access to basic opportunities can break the cycle of the intergenerational transmission of poverty.
The area of infrastructure and the provision of basic public services is therefore reflected as one of
the priority areas.

5.      However, the analysis also finds that a model based on factor accumulation alone will
fall short in making a significant dent into poverty. Despite a remarkable economic turnout
since 1994, the economy continues to be among the poorest in LAC. Nicaragua needs to move to
a higher growth trajectory in order to absorb new entrants into the labor market and continue lifting
Nicaraguans out of poverty. This will require the implementation of policies aimed at improving
the investment climate and business regulations and raising productivity at the firm level.
Therefore, the area of private sector productivity and investment climate has been identified as a
priority.

6.      Moreover, there are significant risks to the sustainability of the development. Most
importantly, Nicaragua is highly vulnerable to climate shocks and natural disasters. In the past,
extreme weather events and seismic activity have caused serious long-term damage to human and
physical capital. This high vulnerability is exacerbated by mismanagement of natural resources.
Leaving those risks unaddressed would undermine the country’s development process going
forward. Therefore, this area is identified as a priority. In addition, Nicaragua has been running
large current account deficits, driven in part by a sizable oil import bill. These deficits have been
financed by FDI flows and the oil collaboration agreement signed with Venezuela since 2007. This
financing has been declining since 2015, due to the progressive deterioration of Venezuela’s
economy and finances. In order to mitigate external shocks stemming from oil price increases,
Nicaragua has to continue to move toward a more diversified energy matrix. In addition,
improvements in the competitiveness in the tradable sector would help narrow the trade balance.
Given the significant downward risks arising from those external vulnerabilities, this area is
identified as a priority.

7.      Finally, the analysis indicates that the strengthening of institutions and improving
public sector efficiency is key to enable progress in Nicaragua. Improving institutional quality
and efficiency of public service delivery is key in all identified priority areas, be it in improvement
of education and facilitation for young Nicaraguans to find employment, provision of
infrastructure, or reduction of vulnerabilities from climate change and management of natural
resources.



                                                  102
8.       As a result, this SCD has identified five priority areas and one cross-cutting theme.
These priority areas are: (i) improvements in education, skills, and job outcomes for the youth; (ii)
provision of infrastructure (transport, energy, and water) and public service delivery; (iii)
improvements in private sector productivity and investment climate; (iv) reduction of
vulnerabilities from climate change and management of natural resources (water, forestry, and
land); and (v) reduction of external vulnerabilities. On top of these priority areas, while areas (i)–
(iii) refer to changes that can have positive impacts on growth and the twin goals, areas (iv) and
(v) are critical for the sustainability of the growth path, which are needed to avoid any negative
externalities and consequences associated with the selected path. The selected priority areas are
aligned with the idea of continuing to support the current model of factor accumulation while
lifting additional levers that enhance competitiveness and productivity growth. The identified
cross-cutting theme of strengthening institutions and the capacity of the public sector is relevant
in all priority areas and a key building block of achieving progress.

Priority #1: Improvements in education, skills, and jobs outcomes for the youth
9.      Improving education, skills, and jobs outcomes for the youth is a critical priority for
Nicaragua. Ongoing demographic changes represent a unique window of opportunity to
accelerate growth. International evidence shows that a growing working-age population has helped
spur growth in other countries. If the higher share of working-age population can be employed
productively, this would automatically translate into higher growth (the so-called “first
demographic dividend”). This requires, among other things, well-functioning labor markets and
an education system that adequately prepares its graduates for the job market. Poor quality of
education and skills mismatches not only hinder growth, but also limit opportunities, especially
for low-income households which heavily rely on their labor supply as their main source of
income. In addition, a well-prepared workforce (both in terms of education and skills) would help
absorb new entrants and raise productivity. Failing to do so could have long-lasting adverse
consequences for Nicaragua’s development prospects, with broad impacts on growth, poverty and
inclusion, and sustainability (reflected in the ninis and the financial sustainability of the social
security system).

10.     Education access and quality is relatively low and Nicaraguans generally lack the
skills to meet the demands of the labor market. Nicaragua’s average years of education are
among the lowest in the region. There are major inequities in access to education between income
groups and areas of residence. The quality of education as measured by standardized test scores
lags behind other LAC countries. The education system is not functioning adequately with regard
to school retention. Increasing access to and improving the quality of education, as well as
developing effective policies to address student dropout, are key priorities for fostering more and
better education and skills. More and better quality education in early years of life contributes to
the cognitive development of children and prevents disadvantaged children from falling behind
their wealthier peers. Moreover, improving access to secondary education, especially in rural
areas, with revised curricula that are more relevant for the labor market will increase school
retention, support labor market entry, and reduce youth engagement in negative social behaviors.
Finally, it is crucial to strengthen teacher quality by sustaining reforms to teacher observation and
mentoring programs, improving incentives for training, and modifying the selection mechanisms.




                                                 103
11.     Better suited skills are also a priority to increase economic opportunities and labor
market outputs for the youth. Given that the skills offered by the education system are not
generally those demanded by the labor market, it is essential that the country strengthen its
technical education to better meet these needs. Improving the education and skills of the young
population is key to building human capital and increasing the productivity needed to foster more
inclusive growth and to continue reducing poverty going forward. Some possibilities include an
evaluation of training programs to identify gaps in the short run and the introduction of vocational
trainings linked to internships and job opportunities in the medium-term.

Priority #2: Provision of infrastructure (transport, energy, and water) and public service
delivery
12.     Several factors make the provision of infrastructure and service delivery a priority
area. Public infrastructure plays an important role in the competitiveness of firms and helps crowd
in private and FDI. High, volatile electricity costs increase production costs, thus hampering firms’
competitiveness and acting as a disincentive for investment. Policy actions in this area should
focus on strengthening and modernizing the energy sector and taking additional steps towards the
diversification of the energy matrix. On the other hand, Nicaragua’s road network is among the
least developed in the region. The poor condition of existing roads due to the lack of maintenance
and spatial disparities represent important bottlenecks for private sector activity. This is of
particular importance given Nicaragua’s reliance on international trade and that high transport and
logistics costs primarily affect traditional import and export products, which tend to be low unit
value agriculture products. Improvements in these areas will boost economic growth and foster
job creation, thus helping to reduce poverty. One pressing need is to improve access to markets
and services in rural areas by continued investment in rural road infrastructure. In addition,
investment on water management infrastructure is another critical area, given its impact on both
agricultural productivity and water availability for human consumption.

13.     Low and unequal access to good quality water and sanitation services represents an
important barrier for intergenerational mobility. Despite progress in recent years, access to
water and sanitation remains low and unequal. Moreover, the quality of services (measured by
continuity of services and pollution) lags behind, especially among the most disadvantaged
population in rural areas. Poor quality and inadequate hygiene translates into higher diarrheal
mortality and health costs. Ensuring clean water provision and sanitation improves health,
education, and productivity, thereby promoting economic growth and contributing to poverty
reduction. The entry points to increase access to good quality water and sanitation include
approving and implementing a water and sanitation development plan, improving management
infrastructure, augmenting the capacity of key sectoral institutions, and expanding the
infrastructure for the delivery of services in the rural areas of the Pacific Coast.

14.     High prevalence of adolescent pregnancy remains a challenge as it is associated with
lower secondary education completion rates, poorer labor outcomes, and poverty. In 2014,
Nicaragua ranked among the countries with the highest adolescent fertility rates in LAC. In
addition, violence against women was relatively high in the country, which negatively affects
economic growth through lower labor productivity. Tackling teenage pregnancy and preventing
intra-family violence can go a long way to increase human capital accumulation and improve youth
job outcomes, decreasing the intergenerational transmission of poverty. An area of interest


                                                104
includes the support of an integrated multisector adolescent strategy that promotes community-
based approaches.

Priority #3: Private sector productivity and investment climate
15.     Improvements in the investment climate and firm productivity in the private sector
are crucial to lift Nicaragua’s growth path into a higher trajectory. Limited access to finance
for MSMEs constrains private sector activity and job creation. This is compounded by existing
barriers to entry, which reinforce market dominance in some sectors. Formalities and procedures
at customs and other border agencies lead to delays and increases in costs of firms’ eroding
competitiveness. Low productivity makes increasing market competition a priority. Provision of
public infrastructure (electricity, water storage and distribution facilities, and roads) is also crucial
to crowd in private sector activity. Some entry points to make improvements in the investment
climate include the implementation of a Doing Business reform program, the implementation of
the World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), performing a regulatory
impact assessment analysis and implementing a regulatory simplification program.

16.    A more disaggregated analysis for some key Nicaraguan sectors and industries helps
shed light on a number of existing challenges and opportunities for expansion. Land
productivity in agriculture—a key sector for the economy in terms of exports and employment—
is among the lowest in the region. Increases in agricultural output so far have been achieved mainly
through an expansion in the agriculture frontier, rather than through intensification and
optimization of land uses. This raises concerns in terms of the sustainability of this model. One
recurrent theme is the low productivity in some key sectors, such as coffee and cattle and dairy.
The light manufacturing sector faces challenges of lack of value addition and product diversity. In
addition, the special economic zones under which some of these firms operate have fallen short in
forging backward linkages to the domestic economy. Some pressing issues for the private sector
include moving towards higher value-added sectors in manufacturing, increasing productivity and
traceability in the cattle and dairy industry, and selective interventions in agriculture.

Priority #4: Reduction of vulnerabilities from climate change and management of natural
resources (water, forestry, and land)
17.     Reducing vulnerabilities arising from climate change and natural disasters, and
improving the management of natural resources are critical to ensure the sustainability of
the recent progress toward the twin goals. Nicaragua is highly exposed to natural disasters and
climate change. Spatial distribution of urban centers, rapid urbanization and proliferation of
precarious settlements, high concentration of poverty in rural areas, and the impact of climate
change on water resources and agriculture are some factors contributing to increased vulnerability
to natural hazards and climate change. Identified areas for policy action include the need to
enhance early warning systems for disaster management and climate change, a better integration
of knowledge of disaster risk management in land-use planning, building resiliency in public
infrastructure (power and roads), and better managing increased climatic risks in agriculture.

18.     This problem is exacerbated by mismanagement of natural resources. Nicaragua’s
capacity to promote sustainable growth depends heavily on how well its natural resources (soil,
water, and forests) are managed. This is critical in view of the growing and competing demand for
these resources and the fact that their supply is becoming more limited and less reliable. Some

                                                  105
areas of interest include the need to improve water demand management across sectors given the
existing seasonal and spatial disparities, strengthening water pollution control and remediation
programs, and promoting reforestation programs and reducing land degradation.

Priority #5: Reduction of external vulnerabilities
19.     Finally, reducing the country’s external vulnerabilities arising from the financing of
large current account deficits remains one of the key priorities. While lower oil prices in recent
years have temporarily reduced vulnerabilities on the external side, the decline in Venezuela’s oil
cooperation financing and potential oil price increases in the near to medium term pose significant
risks to the outlook. Taking additional steps toward a diversified electricity matrix would improve
fiscal sustainability by containing government subsidies and lowering volatility of tariffs that
accrue from the volatility of oil prices. Policies aimed at improving competitiveness and
strengthening the fiscal position of the government would also be critical, by improving the trade
balance and the government’s ability to respond to external shocks.

Cross-cutting theme: Strengthening institutions and public sector efficiency
20.     On top of these priority areas, the analysis indicates the strengthening of institutions
and improving public sector efficiency is key to enable progress in the identified areas.
Overall, indicators of institutional quality suggest that Nicaragua faces significant challenges in
these areas. 180 In addition, indicators of bureaucratic quality suggest that there is a need to
strengthen knowledge, capabilities, and systems for the civil service, including informing the
public of the collection and use of public resources in delivering government services.
Respondents in the executive survey of the Global Competitiveness Report identified the
inefficient government bureaucracy as the most problematic factor in doing business for six years
in a row. Improving institutional quality and the efficiency of public service delivery is key in all
identified priority areas, be it in the improvement of education and facilitation for young
Nicaraguans to find employment, be it in the provision of infrastructure, or in the reduction of
vulnerabilities from climate change and the management of natural resources.

6.2. Policy actions and opportunities within the priority areas
21.     Going beyond the broad priority areas, the SCD provides a set of policy actions that
have been identified within those areas as opportunities to generate advances. The SCD seeks
to identify the most critical actions or policies within these priority areas that represent
opportunities for Nicaragua to continue to improve its progress on shared prosperity and poverty
reduction. To hone in on those opportunities with the greatest potential impact, a series of filters
or criteria have been applied during consultations with World Bank Group staff and some
stakeholders in Nicaragua. This list of policy actions/opportunities can serve as a starting point for
deeper analysis and discussion going forward:181
     Impact on twin goals: Under this criterion, the potential impact on the twin goals of
        reducing poverty and increasing the welfare of the bottom forty percent was assessed.

180
    Since the 1990s, Nicaragua has gradually embarked in a transition process from being a conflict-affected state
toward becoming a relatively effective state. According to the 2011 WDR, even the fastest transforming countries
have taken between 15 and 30 years to raise their institutional performance from that of a fragile state to that of a
functioning institutionalized state.
181
    These criteria are those suggested in the “Analytics Approaches for a Systematic Country Diagnostic: A Resource
Document,” Section 5 prepared by Jeeyeon Seo, February 2014.

                                                        106
       Time horizon of impacts: Here the possible timeframe in which the impact could be
        expected to be realized was taken into account, identifying low-hanging fruits and seeking
        a balance between short- and long-term impacts.
       Complementarities: This filter sought to assess the degree to which an identified
        opportunity in an area would have possible positive impacts on other constraints and
        priority areas.
       Evidence-base: The greater the evidence base, the more weight an identified opportunity
        was given in the prioritization process.
       Political feasibility: The country’s political economy affects the feasibility of addressing
        the proposed actions or reforms. Although each opportunity was assessed against this
        criterion, opportunities with low political feasibility were still included.
       Essential preconditions: Two definitions of this criterion were used. The first was if the
        proposed actions or reforms were a necessary condition for a productive life, such as
        ensuring a “basic minimum standard of living for all.” The second was if the opportunity
        was a critical one for other equally important opportunities to be addressed.

22.     This last step was carried out through two activities: (i) a half-day workshop with
World Bank Group staff and sector experts and (ii) consultations with stakeholders in
Nicaragua. In the workshop, World Bank Group staff gathered information and inputs on possible
policy actions and interventions that could address the challenges and constraints identified under
each of the priority areas. These inputs were organized in the form of matrices around specific
opportunities to which the SCD filters were applied. This allowed sectoral teams to cross-fertilize
across thematic areas, and engage in discussions on the feasibility and relevance of some of the
interventions. These matrices were then refined and shared broadly with World Bank Group staff
to seek additional input as needed to fill remaining gaps in some of the areas/filters. Consultations
with stakeholders in Nicaragua allowed for the discussion and validation of identified priority areas
as well as prioritized opportunities. In particular, it allowed for better understanding of the political
economy context and time horizon of some of the proposed actions. A list of these actions is
presented in Annex 1 of this chapter.

1 Introduction


The relationship between informed decisions and knowledge about foreseen risks remains a central theme in
the areas of policy-making and investment. The lack of suitable predictive models and rudimentary rules of
thumb leaves policy-makers and investors make decisions without proper knowledge of upside and downside
risk dimensions associated to a random phenomenon. Especially in economics, the construction of proper
predictive models should be a binding task before a policy or investment assessment is generated. As further
discussed below, if a model is not able to predict reliable outcomes via central measures and confidence
intervals, it should not be used as a policy benchmark.
    This research introduces a Bayesian information-theoretical method to construct reliable density
forecasts. 2 Uncertainty in density forecasts is measured through the shape of the elicited probability
distribution which in some cases can be depicted by the variance and skewness statistics. The construction
of reliable forecasts is done using a combination of ex-post and ex-ante information, for which the introduced
method quantifies and evaluates the embedded uncertainty in density predictions. The procedure includes
decompositions of ex-ante variance and skewness of the predicted random variable. The ex-ante variance and
skewness are decomposed in risk factor shares. These variance and skewness decompositions highlight the
importance of ex-ante risk factor behaviors in shaping the density forecasts.
   Under a noisy informational framework, the introduced Bayesian methodology adopts the Kullback-
Leibler‚Äîor relative-entropy‚Äîfunction. Whereas ex-post and ex-ante information could come with
measurement errors and other types of irregularities, the Bayesian entropy method relies on a principle that
optimizes the noise around the predictions as information becomes available. As a Bayesian procedure, the
author argues that it is desirable to incorporate prior information to improve the accuracy of generated
density forecasts.
    While the revision of established forecasting systems is important in enhancing the quality of predictions,
there is no incentive in doing so if there are no transparent mechanisms to evaluate the reliability of elicited
forecasts. In this paper, the evaluation of elicited density forecasts is made via scoring rules. A scoring rule is
a statistic that quantifies in ex-post manner the accuracy of released forecasts. A scoring rule is defined as a
numerical ranking based on the predictive probability distribution and the materialized event. A scoring rule
could be proper or improper. Proper scoring rules provide the incentive for the forecaster to elicit his or her
best and honest predictions. On this matter, the implementation of transparent scoring rule frameworks is
encouraged to distinguish forecasting skill heterogeneity. In addition, the sequential compilation of scoring
rule outcomes will allow for future forecast enhancements.
   The objective of the proper scoring rule framework is twofold: to evaluate the density forecast and to
incentivize the generation of better‚Äîprobabilistic‚Äîpredictions. In terms of evaluation, the scoring rule

                                                                   2
measures the quality of elicited density forecasts. It also rewards the forecaster for his or her probability
predictions, and ranks density forecast outcomes. From the perspective of the generation of forecasts, a
scoring rule has two purposes: to encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments, and to ensure that
the forecaster retains his or her honesty during the process, i.e., to ensure that the forecaster elicits his or her
true and best density forecast.
   A density forecast is a risk management tool that helps depict and quantify risks, expected returns, or
measures related to the risks associated with the forecasted variable. Density forecasts vary in their scope and
application. Density‚Äîprobabilistic‚Äîforecasts are more informative and more valuable to decision makers
than categorical‚Äî‚Äúinterest rates will not rise this year‚Äù‚Äîor mean forecasts given that they explicitly
recognize and quantify uncertainty (Winkler 1996). For instance, in modern financial risk management,
tools like portfolio Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts and conditional VaR assessments make use of predictive
densities; e.g., in Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Labys (2003). For policy-making purposes, the density
forecasts help contextualize the risks associated with a policy variable and its outcomes. The hazard is that
the decision-takers might not process the information embedded in the generated probabilistic forecasts in
proper forms, e.g., they could take decisions with very large or relatively very small risk.
    Although a few institutions and companies have achieved some progress in generating probabilistic
forecasts, they are still scarce and‚Äîwhen available‚Äîare not clearly evaluated. Some central banks and
financial institutions have implemented predictive densities to assess inflation, GDP growth, market
volatility, exchange rates, etc. Examples include the International Monetary Fund (Kannan and Elekdag
2009), Bank of England (2013, 2014, Inflation Report, several volumes), Sveriges Riksbank (2014,
Monetary Policy Report, several volumes), the Reserve Bank of India (Banerjee and Das 2011), European
Central Bank (2013, 2014, Macroeconomic Projections, several volumes), Banco Central de Chile (2014,
Informe de Pol√≠tica Monetaria, several volumes), Bank of Mexico (2015, Quarterly Inflation Report, several
volumes), Banco Central Do Brasil (2014, Inflation Report, several volumes), Central Bank of the Republic
of Turkey (2014, Inflation Report, several volumes), among many other central banks and forecasting
agencies.
   Information extracted from surveys on expectation and implied statistics of forecasting models can be
useful in assessing the uncertainty in predictive density forecasts. While the use of ex-ante information to
predict uncertainty is becoming more common, there is still some disagreement regarding its predictive
power. Rich and Tracy (2010) build up uncertainty statistics to analyze inflation forecasts from the Survey
of Professional Forecasters (SPF). Their results found little evidence that disagreement among forecasters is
a good proxy for inflation uncertainty. On the other hand, using the same SPF data, Giordani and S√∂derlind
(2003) find that disagreement among forecasters is a good proxy for inflation and for output growth
uncertainties.
   This Bayesian framework allows the incorporation of subjective and prior information on some
parameters and statistics. It is known that forecasters disagree in beliefs and in assigning prior distributions.
These disagreements in beliefs might be interpreted as a reflection of underlying uncertainty (Al-Najjar and
Shmaya 2015). On that account, the methodology is flexible to exploit heterogeneity in beliefs embedded in
prior probability distributions evaluating the accuracy of generated predictive density forecasts. For reliability
purposes and transparency, predictive densities need to be evaluated. Without proper evaluation of the
predictive outcomes, the forecast exercise becomes meaningless and unreliable. The prequential forecasting

system framework (Dawid 1984) combined with statistical ‚Äúproper scoring rules‚Äù (Savage 1971) is applied
in this research to assess the dynamic performance of the Bayesian entropy-generated density forecasts.
    The literature of subjective probabilistic assessments comes from a long-standing tradition and with a
wealth of examples. The pioneering work of Brier (1950) establishes the quadratic score to evaluate
probabilistic forecasts using a raining example. Brier (1950) looks into the principle of the proper scoring
rules to devise a verification scheme that cannot influence the forecaster in any undesirable way. Using the
quadratic (Brier) score for various weather elements, Sanders (1963) provides evidence that skillful
probability statements can indeed be formulated subjectively. Winkler and Murphy (1968) discuss properties
of proper scoring rules to evaluate probability forecasts. Winkler and Murphy (1968) argue that a subjective
probability statement quantifies the confidence of an individual in a true and particular proposition, e.g., an
economist‚Äôs confidence in the statement that ‚Äúnext-year inflation will be two percent‚Äù. The assessment of
elicitation of probabilities and the discussion of proper scoring rules are widely debated in Savage (1971),
which concludes that scoring rules enable us, in principle, to discover people‚Äôs opinions.
    As an alternative to proper scoring rules, the quality, evaluation, and improvement of density forecasts
can be assessed through probabilistic forecast calibration procedures. The calibration technique makes use of
the cumulative probability integral transform. Although calibration and scoring rules are complementary
procedures in assessing the quality of forecasts, the scoring rule framework still allows the forecasters to be
rewarded for their probability predictions and to directly rank forecasters or forecasting systems.
Lichtenstein, Fischhoff and Phillips (1982) summarize the literature on the calibration of point and density
forecasts up to the 1980s. Dawid (1982) posits a theorem to assess calibration and also discusses
recalibration processes and coherence versus calibration. Bunn (1984) explains the calibration and
recalibration procedures of discrete predictive densities‚Äîas well as the evaluation of probabilistic forecasts
through scoring rules. Examples of calibration and re-calibration assessments to improve univariate density
forecasts are found in Kling (1987), Kling and Bessler (1989), Schervish (1989), Bessler and Kling (1990),
etc. More recently, Diebold, Hahn and Tay (1999) have extended the univariate calibration assessment to a
multivariate framework using an example which involves high frequency exchange rate density forecasts.
   In this paper, the author introduces the Bayesian entropy (BEN) procedure to generate density forecasts
for solving an information-theoretical problem, which uses ex-post and ex-ante information of the studied
variable and its risk factors. The empirical application generates density forecasts of world GDP growth
associating selected risk factors: terms spreads, absolute deviations of headline inflation targets, energy prices,
and the S&P 500 index prices. There are two key advantages of using the BEN procedure. First, prior
information of the underlying unknown and unobserved parameters‚Äîor latent variables‚Äîcan be
incorporated to help the system find less noisy levels of information. Second, the Bayesian entropy procedure
recovers and processes information when the underlying sampling model is partly or incorrectly known, and
the data is limited, partial or incomplete (Golan, Judge and Miller 1996).
   The BEN procedure is described in the following sections of the paper. Distributional assumptions,
econometric considerations, unobserved statistics, prior information, and the Bayesian entropy setup are
explained in Section 2 of this paper. Proper scoring rules that underpin the evaluation of density forecasts
using the continuous ranked probability score are presented in Section 3. The BEN technique is tested in
Section 4 through an empirical application that generates predictive world GDP growth densities. The
practical exercise uses a variable that faces‚Äîex-ante and ex-post‚Äîconcerns of being incorrectly known,


                                                        4
incorrectly quantified, or both. Risk factors, prior values, generated density forecast series, and their scores
are also described in Section 4. Finally, the main conclusions of this study and further research are presented
in Section 5.


2 The Model


The presented BEN technique allows for the quantification of risks in the prediction of a studied variable.
The BEN procedure can be applied to predict economic variables; however, it is also suitable in other fields
where unobserved information prevails. Examples of studied or target variables are GDP growth, poverty
headcount rates, population growth, consumer price inflation, stock market prices or returns, consumption
or investment levels, etc. The generation of the BEN density forecasts uses two categories of constraints:
behavioral and statistical ones. The behavioral constraints rely on the assumption that parametric
distributions depict the density forecasts. The statistical‚Äîconsistency‚Äîconstraint relies on formal
probability statements that model random variables. Even though several parametric and non-parametric
distributions are available, the selected distribution should particularly facilitate the estimation of dispersion
and skewness statistics.


2.1 Distributional assumptions

For the purpose of generating the predictive probability density function of the target variable, the author
relies on the two-piece normal (TPN) function. The forecasted variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, is predicted using three statistics:
a central measure like the mode, a dispersion measure like the variance, and a skewness measure like the third
central moment statistic. The TPN assumption (Wallis 2014) is flexible enough to allow skewed
distributional shapes of the predicted random variable. Furthermore, the TPN assumption permits and
facilitates the dynamic modeling and estimation of predictive density forecasts under a proposed minimal-
noise optimization setup. While the TPN allows the modeling of the bias in the distribution, the TPN
assumption could be‚Äîin some cases‚Äîa real restriction, especially for variables with very high or very low
levels of excess kurtosis, i.e., leptokurtic and platykurtic shapes, respectively. The functional form and details
of the TPN distribution are presented in Appendix 1.
    Under the TPN assumption, the shape of the distribution of the forecasted variable, 3 Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, can be defined
via the mode, a dispersion, and a skewness statistic. Ex-ante dispersion and skewness information are inputs
to identify the forecast uncertainty dimensions of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å. This is complemented with an assessed forecast mode‚Äî
or most likely outcome of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å‚Äîand the TPN distributional assumption. The ex-ante dispersion magnitude
that the forecaster elicits reflects his level of knowledge and confidence on the likelihood around central
expected outcomes. The ex-ante skewness of the predicted variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, summarizes the forecaster‚Äôs knowledge
and beliefs that the most likely outcome would materialize on one or the other side of the distribution.
   There are two complementary angles to the usefulness of eliciting dispersion and skewness measures:
technical and policy oriented. On the technical side, the assessment of dispersion and skewness statistics is

3
    Alternatively, the forecasted variable can be called target, focus, or predicted variable.


                                                                      5
central to properly quantifying the upside and downside uncertainty of the most likely outcome of the
predicted variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å. The technical side also allows the evaluation of uncertainty in recursive form and the
testing of the predictive power of the elicited density forecasts. From the policy analysis angle, the predictive
dispersion and skewness statistics provide the forecaster‚Äôs sentiment around the most likely outcome. In
policy analysis, these two statistics provide a key understanding of the future behavior of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, complementing
the decision-making process under uncertainty.


2.2 The linear assumption

The BEN procedure is a non-linear inversion procedure. It provides a basis for information recovery while
helping to make conservative inferences about an unknown and unobservable number, vector or function
(Golan, Judge and Miller 1996). In the case of the estimation of predictive density functions, the target
variable‚Äîand its statistics‚Äîmight be unobserved and indeed not accessible for direct measurement. The
assembled system incorporates not only ex-post information, but also ex-ante information about dispersion
and skewness measures of associated risk factors of the target random variable.
    The forecasted variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, is assumed to be a function of a subset of risk factors, Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å ‚äÜ Ì†µÌ∫ØÌ†µÌ∫Ø. The selection
of the subset of risk factors, Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å, might depend on empirical results and theoretical underpinnings associated
with Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å . Note that Ì†µÌ∫ØÌ†µÌ∫Ø denotes the complete set of risk factors; Ì†µÌ∫ØÌ†µÌ∫Ø = {Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å, Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê }, where Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ê states for the
complement of Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å. The forecasted dispersion and skewness measures of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å are assumed to depend on‚Äîex-
post and ex-ante‚Äîinformation of Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å . The basic idea is that markets perform not only using ex-post
information, they behave incorporating ex-ante information once it is made available. The uncertainty of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å
is approximated using dispersion and skewness statistics. Both statistics are modeled in separate forms to
support their specific constraints. For instance, while the variance is always a positive number, the third
central moment statistic can take negative and positive values.
   The BEN procedure looks to exploit the potential uneven and noisy trajectories of Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å and Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å using a
minimization information-theoretical setup. The combination of the ex-post and ex-ante information of Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å
and the ex-post information of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å are key inputs in the BEN procedure, which estimates ex-ante uncertainty
on Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å. The ex-ante information of Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å, compiled from a variety of theoretical models and from assorted survey
sources, is key to‚Äîand complements‚Äîthe BEN procedure in estimating the ex-ante uncertainty on Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å.
Let us denote the set of risk factors indices by Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö = {Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü1 , Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü2 , ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö |Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü1 ‚àà ‚Ñï‚â•1 , ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö ‚àà ‚Ñï‚â•1 , Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü1 < Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü2 <
‚ãØ < Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö }. The predicted variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, is assumed to be a function of Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö , i.e., number of risk factors: Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å =
Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ì(Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å); Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å = ÔøΩÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü1 Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü2 ‚Ä¶ Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö ÔøΩ = ÔøΩÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±ç1 Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±ç2 ‚Ä¶ Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö ÔøΩ. For econometric convenience, the behavioral assumption
that links Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å to the exogenous risk factors, Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å, is linear, as stated in equation (1). This equation restricts the
reactions of the variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å to risk factors movements.
(1)        Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° = Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é1 Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±ç1,Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° + ‚ãØ + Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö,Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° + Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° .
          To describe ex-post and ex-ante categories of information, let us denote Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á as the current period. The
three main categories of information in the BEN procedure are: i) ex-post information of the target variable,
{Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° }Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±Å                                                                            Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á
           Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°=Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°1 ; ii) ex-post information of the associated risk factors, {Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° }Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°=Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°1 ; and iii) ex-ante available

    The process of the predicted variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, is defined on a complete probability space, (Œ©, ‚Ñ± , Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É), which is
filtered using an increasing family of Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé-fields in discrete time over the sequence Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á = {Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°1 , Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°2 , ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á |Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°1 ‚àà

period Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°, the information set ‚Ñ±Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° includes all the relevant information of the target variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° , and the
associated risk factors, Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° . This implies that the information set ‚Ñ±Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° comprises all the available information,
ex-post and ex-ante.
    The BEN procedure does not focus on predicting Ì†µÌ¥ºÌ†µÌ¥º(Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°+‚Ñé |‚Ñ±Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° ) or Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö(Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°+‚Ñé |‚Ñ±Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° ); these are taken as a
given. The argument is that there are many models that do a good job of predicting central measures under
structural and economic assumptions and statistical constraints. The BEN method hence focuses on
predicting two measures of uncertainty of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å: the ex-ante conditional variance and skewness, Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£Ì†µÌ±£ÔøΩÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å               ÔøΩÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°+‚Ñé |‚Ñ±Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° ÔøΩ

and Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌªæÔøΩÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å
   The key advantage of the BEN method involves the combination of ex-post data of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å with all the
available ex-ante and ex-post information of Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å at any period Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° ‚àà Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á and for any available horizons, ‚Ñé ‚àà Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞ª .

Note that Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌªæ(‚àô) denotes the skewness operator. The predicted conditional variance and skewness of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å are a
weighted average of the conditional dispersion and skewness statistics of the accounted risk factors. The error

Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 in the Appendix section.


2.3 Unobserved statistics

The BEN procedure mainly looks to predict the variance and skewness of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å for period Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á + ‚Ñé, for any
horizon ‚Ñé ‚àà Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞ª . Note that Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á is defined as the current period. However, the ex-ante information of these
statistics is uncertain or unobserved, i.e., the modeler‚Äîthe author‚Äîdoes not have data for the series
                                                       ÔøΩÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°+‚Ñé |‚Ñ±Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±° ÔøΩÔøΩÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á ‚àí1 for all horizon ‚Ñé ‚àà Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞ª . This restriction complicates the

information while estimating (2) and (3): i) the set of coefficients Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥ = {Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é1 , Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é2 , ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö }; ii) the ex-ante

    The same coefficients {Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é1 , Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é2 , ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö } that come from the econometric assumption in (1) constrain the
estimation of equation (2) and (3). Clearly, for consistency purposes, (2) and (3) must be estimated
simultaneously. Thus, the BEN procedure is a constrained non-linear programming model. The simultaneous
recovery of the coefficients in the set Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥ restricts the number of values that the parameters can take. While
the coefficients in Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥ estimate the direct effects on the statistics of the forecasted variables, the cross-effects
of the risk factors on the target variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, are also captured and added up in the error terms, Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌºñÌ†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé 2 and Ì†µÌºñÌ†µÌºñÌ†µÌªæÌ†µÌªæ 3 .
For analytical purposes, the coefficients in equations (2) and (3) should be read as first-order effects of the
risk statistics over the forecasted variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å.


2.4 Prior information and estimation steps

The BEN procedure incorporates prior information related to Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å and Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å. The use of prior information is
simply an implication of the principles that one should fully specify to make probabilistic statements of what
is unknown (Geweke and Whiteman 2006). The subjective probability distribution that a decision maker
assesses upon a variable should embody a synthesis of all his or her information relevant to its outcome (Bunn
1984, chapter seven). In the BEN procedure, prior knowledge is used to condition on what is known.
Therefore, prior sampling information of the underlying phenomena is incorporated, as well as the


                                                                                                                                          8
perceptions of the forecaster. This subjective information about the distribution of a phenomena could be
symmetric or skewed, although in any case they should always be coherent (De Finetti 1937).
   Under the above distributional and linear assumptions, the econometric steps for estimating (2) and (3)
have to deal with two main restrictions: i) the ex-ante variance and skewness of the predicted variable are
unobserved or uncertain; ii) there might be empirical evidence, previous literature, or beliefs affecting the
sign of the coefficients in equations (2) and (3). To deal with these major constraints, the BEN procedure
solves a minimization information-theoretical setup where prior information is integrated. The BEN follows
an information-theoretical econometric method, as presented in Golan, Judge and Miller (1996), and Judge
and Mittelhammer (2011). Five steps are designed to describe the solution of the minimization information-
theoretical procedure:
      1. Prior mean values are set for each of the risk factor coefficients in the set Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥0 = {Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é1 0 , Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é2 0 , ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö 0 }.

      4. Prior probability mass distributions are set for error terms that account for the noise between the
         above-selected prior mean values and their corresponding posterior values.

          The first step implies the definition of the range of outcomes that the‚Äîposterior‚Äîcoefficients can take.
To accomplish this objective, the uncertain and unobserved parameters, Ì†µÌ∞¥Ì†µÌ∞¥ = {Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é1 , Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é2 , ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö }, in (2) and
(3), are modeled as posterior values. The BEN procedure assumes that the posterior value of each parameter,

Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü , depends on its estimated prior, Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é
the prior coefficient and its error term is assumed to follow an additive manner.

2.5 Bayesian entropy estimation

The fifth step of the procedure consists of solving a minimization information-theoretical problem. The
posterior mean values and error terms in (2) and (3) of the following parameters are simultaneously

defined the risk factor set as Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ±Ö, the time set as Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á, and the horizons set as Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞ª.
   The objective function in (16) implies to minimize the noise (Kullback-Leibler pseudo-measure) between
the posterior and the prior error distributions of the error terms on the set Ì†µÌºâÌ†µÌºâ . The consistency restrictions
(17)‚Äì(20) assure coherence on the probability properties of the variety of involved random terms. The
posterior error mean values of the variety of random terms are described in (21). The Bayesian update of the
posterior mean value of the variety of random terms is done in additive form as pointed out in (22)‚Äì(25).
Finally, the behavioral restrictions include the TPN probability distributional assumption of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å and the linear
association between the risk factors Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å and Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, as denoted in (26)‚Äì(29).


3 Scores


3.1 Proper scoring rules

The reliability of the predicted density forecasts can be evaluated using proper scoring rules. The scoring
rules allow the ranking of density forecast accuracy in assigning a numerical score. The score is based on two
characteristics: a) the predictive distribution; and b) the event, state of nature, or numerical value that is
realized. Proper scoring rules incentivize the forecaster to elicit his or her best predictive density forecasts
and to be honest (Murphy and Epstein 1967). The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) evaluates
predictive cumulative density functions as proper scoring rules (Gneiting and Raftery 2007). Properties of
the proper scoring rules and the definitions of the CRPS are presented in the following paragraphs.
    The true forecaster‚Äôs predictive probability for the target random variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å is denoted with Ì†µÌ≤ëÌ†µÌ≤ë and the
forecaster‚Äôs reported predictive probability with Ì†µÌ≤ñÌ†µÌ≤ñ. Both Ì†µÌ≤ëÌ†µÌ≤ë and Ì†µÌ≤ñÌ†µÌ≤ñ can be probability density functions or
probability mass distributions. The scoring rule is a function Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±Ü(Ì†µÌ≤ëÌ†µÌ≤ë, Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) that assigns a score and maps into real

functions Ì†µÌ≤ëÌ†µÌ≤ë and Ì†µÌ≤ñÌ†µÌ≤ñ. Finally, the scoring rule is strictly proper when the equality holds if and only if Ì†µÌ≤ëÌ†µÌ≤ë = Ì†µÌ≤ñÌ†µÌ≤ñ
almost surely (Gneiting 2011).

If the forecaster prefers to use his true density function Ì†µÌ≤ëÌ†µÌ≤ë, instead of cheating and reporting any other
function Ì†µÌ≤ñÌ†µÌ≤ñ, the forecaster will be enforced by the proper scoring rule to set Ì†µÌ≤ñÌ†µÌ≤ñ = Ì†µÌ≤ëÌ†µÌ≤ë, i.e., the forecaster obtains
his best expected score for reporting his true predictive probability. Besides that, the negative orientation of
(30) with respect to the forecast accuracy originates from a conventional change of minimizing the
forecaster‚Äôs expected penalty to maximizing the forecaster‚Äôs expected score (Bunn 1984). Thus, the lower the
score in (30), the better the forecaster is compensated. Hence, the desire to minimize the expected score from
a strictly proper scoring rule motivates the forecaster to provide probabilities that are well calibrated and
sharp (Winkler 1986). Proper scoring rules motivate the forecasters to minimize their individual expected

density evaluations minimizes the concerns that assessed subjective probabilities are in some sense arbitrary.
   The objective of the scoring rule can also be interpreted in an ex-post sense. Assume that Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å has Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á

    By definition, a proper scoring rule assumes that the forecaster is risk-neutral. The basic framework of
the proper scoring rule assumes a linear utility reward for the agent (Nelson and Bessler 1989). Some rules,
such as the quadratic, logarithmic, and spherical ones, are motivated by this risk-neutral assumption.
Derivations of the proper scoring rules under the risk-neutral forecaster hypothesis can be seen in Winkler
and Murphy (1968), Winkler (1996), Bunn (1984), Kr√§mer (2006), Bickel (2007), Gneiting, Balabdaoui
and Raftery (2007), among others. Non-risk-neutral forecasters might have different implications on the
forecaster‚Äôs incentives to elicit his or her true and honest probability predictions. Examples of risk-averse and
risk-lover forecasters can be seen in Winkler and Murphy (1970), Winkler (1996), Bickel (2007), Johnstone
(2007), Johnstone (2007), and Johnstone, Jose and Winkler (2011).

The weights Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±°+‚Ñé can be estimated taking into account some cyclicality or seasonality depending on two
main considerations: i) the exact date when the forecast is released‚Äîseasonal component‚Äî; and ii) how
many horizons ahead the forecast was made for. For instance, a density forecast elicited in January 2017 to
predict the annual private consumption of Rep√∫blica Bolivariana de Venezuela during 2017 could be
penalized or rewarded differently than a density forecast released in December 2017 to predict the same
annual event. The December 2017 density forecast would have incorporated useful information of the first
three quarters of 2017, while the January 2017 density forecast would lack the use of this information. Using
this logic, in this paper, it is assumed that the closer the event is to being materialized, the more the score

ranking of density forecasts. The literature addressing the CRPS and some of its properties are Epstein
(1969), Murphy (1971), Brown (1974), Matheson and Winkler (1976), Von Holstein (1977), Hersbach
(2000), Gneiting, Raftery, Westveld III and Goldman (2005), Kohonen and Suomela (2006), Grimit,
Gneiting, Berrocal and Johnson (2006), and Gneiting, Balabdaoui and Raftery (2007), among others. For
descriptive purposes, the predictive probability density function (PDF) of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å is denoted by Ì†µÌºåÌ†µÌºå(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) . It is
assumed that any predictive PDF Ì†µÌºåÌ†µÌºå(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) is generated by a PFS. The cumulative distribution function (CDF)
for the value Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶ of the random variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å is denoted by Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) = Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å ‚â§ Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶).

      On the other hand, the CDF for the value Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶ of the realized event-variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é is denoted as Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) =
Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é ‚â§ Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) . Note that Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) is the indicator function 1{(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶‚àíÌ†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é )‚â•0} . Under this notation, the CRPS
definition can be stated as presented in (32). Figure 1 shows an example of elicited probability density and
cumulative distribution functions for the released predicting variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å and the realized variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é .
                                                                                               ‚àû
(32)                      Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂ = Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ∞∂(Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É, Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é ) = ‚à´‚àí‚àû
                                                                                    [Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶)]2 Ì†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ë.

    The CRPS ranks the distance between the issued event probabilities, Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) and the materialized event
probability, Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) . Then, the CRPS measures the difference between the predicted and the occurred
cumulative distributions. The CRPS best and minimal value of zero is only achieved when Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶) = Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é (Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶),
that is, in the case of a perfect categorical (deterministic) foresight. The CRPS has the dimension of the
random variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, which is entered via the integration over Ì†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ë. The CRPS can be understood as the limit
of a ranked probability score (RPS)‚ÄîEpstein (1969) and Murphy (1971)‚Äîwith an infinite number of
classes and each with zero width.
  The CRPS is oriented in negative form, that is, a low score is preferred to a high one. The lower the
CRPS score, the better the prediction characteristics of the forecaster. Most importantly, the CRPS is



                                                                                                           15
sensitive to the shape of the distribution outside the realized value Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±é . The CRPS score is strictly proper, in
the sense that a risk-neutral forecaster will maximize his expected score if his released distribution Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶)
agrees with his true predictive distribution, Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞∫ (Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±¶). Moreover, the evaluation of several density forecasts across
time can be studied via the weighted average of individual scores, as pointed out in equation (31), i.e.,

4 Application of the method: Prediction of world GDP growth


The use of national accounting systems started to become predominant across nations importantly in the
twentieth century. During this period, the prediction of economic growth quickly gained importance and
surged. Predicting economic growth accurately is an activity that many economists still struggle with. Given
its importance in the current economic framework, often, predicting global and cross-country economic
growth receives a lot of attention and resources. Despite this, history has shown that forecasters constantly
fail to foresee the precise economic growth of a country. Sometimes, these economic growth predictions fail
dramatically. Recent evidence shows how a variety of forecasters have failed in predicting the economic
growth of several countries (Figure 2). The January 2007‚ÄìDecember 2008 historical forecast errors‚Äîfor
the next-year horizon‚Äîexemplify a period of high overconfident predictions, preceded and followed by
under-confident forecast episodes.
   In this section, the BEN procedure is applied to estimate world GDP growth density forecasts. Moreover,
an evaluation of the generated forecasts is implemented. The CRPS proper scoring rule is used to evaluate
the estimated density predictions. The assembled PFS follows the model stated in (16)‚Äì(29). To
complement and benchmark the constructed BEN forecasts, na√Øve‚Äîor rule of thumb‚Äîdensity predictions
are generated. The na√Øve forecasts are symmetric by construction. These benchmark predictions follow a
normal distribution with mean equal to the most likely outcome and standard deviation equal to the‚Äî
sample‚Äîstandard deviation of historical forecasts errors.
    During the application, the ex-ante global growth density is assumed as partially unobserved. On one side,
its most likely outcome‚Äîmode‚Äîis taken from predictions made in a structural model‚Äîwith inputs from
experts on country economic growth. On the other side, the conditional variance and the conditional third
central moment of world GDP growth are not observed. The conditional variance and skewness measures
complete the required statistics that fully depict the assumed TPN distribution stated in (28)‚Äì(29).
    Monthly historical information about world GDP growth and risk factors is collected for the period of
October 2005‚ÄìAugust 2015 to generate the density forecasts. The ex-ante information of GDP growth and
its risk factors uses predictive and implied data covering the scope of annual predictions over the period of
2005‚Äì2017. Predictive conditional variance and skewness series are estimated combining the historical and
ex-ante information via the BEN procedure. The recovered conditional variance and skewness series are
combined with historical information of world GDP growth and with predictive most likely outcomes‚Äî
elicited in August 2015. This information allows the generation of predictive densities of global growth over
the monthly time span of October 2005‚ÄìAugust 2015 with an annual horizon ‚Ñé = {‚Ñé1 = Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á , ‚Ñé2 = Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á +

1, ‚Ñé3 = Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á + 2}, such that Ì†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±ÅÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á = 2015. For instance, the density forecasts estimated for October 2006
predicted the world GDP growth in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

4.1 Risk factors and prior information

The subset of risk factors Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å directly affecting global growth is shrunk to four variables. These random
variables are: i) global absolute deviations from consumer price inflation targets; ii) global energy prices
proxied by crude oil prices; iii) global financial conditions quantified by the S&P 500 index price; and iv)
world term spreads measured by country-individual term spreads.
   The density predictions for GDP growth are constructed reflecting upon the basic economic mechanisms
between output growth and its underlying risks. These linear relationships of GDP growth, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å , and its
associated risk factors Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å imply the constrained behavior of the variance and skewness. Although there is no
general consensus on the sign of the linear associations, in this application, the assumed responses of global
growth to the associated risk factor movements have been supported in previous studies.

                                                                 World (CPI) Headline

                                                                 Deviations from Targets

    The sign restrictions on the responses of World GDP growth to the movements of its global risk factors
are presented in Table 1. The sign of the risk-coefficients in the linear equation (1) define the reactions of



                                                                             17
the skewness to predicted global growth. The sign of the coefficients in equation (1) are preserved in the
skewness equation (27). Thus‚Äîmarginally‚Äîthe global growth skewness is synchronized with the
directional change of an associated risk factor. In addition, to identify the responses of GDP growth to
changes in the selected risk factors, ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions using ex-post data under a variety
of controls were estimated and presented in Appendix 6‚ÄìTable 2.
   International financial conditions affecting global growth are represented using cross-country term
spreads and the S&P 500 index prices. High interest rate term spreads are assumed positively linked with
output growth. This is in line with the following authors: Harvey (1989), Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991),
Haubrich and Dombrosky (1996), Stock and Watson (2003), Wheelock and Wohar (2009), Aretz and
Peel (2010), and Kao, Kuan and Chen (2013), among others. The stock market performance measured by
the S&P 500 index prices‚Äîand other equity indexes‚Äîis assumed to be positively associated with anticipated
output growth; as per Mitchell and Burns (1938), Fama (1981), Fischer and Merton (1984), Harvey (1989),
Jay Choi, Hauser and Kopecky (1999), Hassapis and Kalyvitis (2002), and Tsouma (2009), among others.
   Energy sector performance‚Äîmeasured via crude oil and gas prices‚Äîis assumed to be negatively
associated with output growth. This association is in line with Hamilton (2005), Jimenez-Rodriguez and
S√°nchez (2005), Blanchard and Gali (2007), Blanchard and Riggi (2013), etc. Absolute deviations of CPI
headline inflation targets are negatively associated with GDP growth performance. In this empirical
application, the assumed benchmark inflation target is fixed at two percent across the country sample; this
negative relationship is supported by the results obtained in the OLS regressions presented in Table 2.
    The four selected risk factors affecting world GDP growth are divided into two categories given their
data source: i) survey-based; and ii) market-based. The survey-based risk factors are: a) the term spread; and
b) the CPI inflation. The survey-based factors are collected by Consensus Economics. The market-based risk
factor information is collected using Bloomberg. Implied volatilities of option prices are collected for the
S&P 500 index, and for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude oils. Elicited most likely forecasts
of world GDP growth are obtained from the World Bank.
    Ex-ante global uncertainty statistics of term spread and the inflation measure are used as a proxy for the
average aggregation of country-specific series weighted with corresponding real GDP information. The global
term spread variance and skewness are constructed using the term spread data of 15 countries: Australia,
Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The global inflation variance and skewness
are aggregations from country data accounting for the 20 biggest economies in terms of GDP size: Australia,
Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, the
Netherlands, Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United
States.
   Implied volatilities of option contracts are the main source of information for estimating the ex-ante
variance and skewness of the S&P 500 and crude oil prices. The selected implied volatilities come from
option contracts with 3, 12 and 24-month maturities to represent the uncertainty for current year, next-year,
and two-year ahead horizons. The procedure for recovering the variance and skewness of the equity and
commodity prices from implied volatility series‚Äîassuming the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
model‚Äîis discussed in Appendix 4.

    The most challenging section of the BEN method involves the identification of prior unobserved ex-ante
variance and skewness of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å; real world GDP growth in this empirical application. Using the sign restrictions
presented in Table 1, the author modeled the prior ex-ante variance and skewness of real world GDP growth
as pointed out in Section 2.4‚ÄîPrior information and estimation steps. Using data of world GDP growth
baseline forecasts, Table 4 shows that there is generally an overprediction pattern in the elicited predictions.
Thus, opposite to the overpredicted forecasts, the initial guess for the prior global ex-ante skewness is to
assign more weight to the downside section of the world GDP growth predicted distribution; i.e., to assign
negative skewness values. In this specific world GDP growth forecast context, the mechanics of ‚Äúoptimistic
baseline forecasts assessed with bigger downside than upside risks‚Äù are a summary of the phrase ‚Äúhope for
the best, and prepare for the worst‚Äù. Finally, once priors for the alpha coefficients and the ex-ante variance
and skewness of real GDP are selected, then the model presented in Section 2.5‚ÄîBayesian entropy
estimation‚Äîcan be applied to recover posterior estimates.


4.2 Estimated density forecasts

The semiannual elicited World Bank forecasts‚Äîmost likely predicted outcomes‚Äîof real world GDP
growth were combined with posterior monthly series of the ex-ante variance and skewness of real GDP
growth to construct hypothetical monthly density forecasts. These generated monthly density forecasts are
made from October 2005 to August 2015. The produced forecasts are called Bayesian entropy-generated
forecasts‚Äîor BEN density forecasts.
    Examples of hypothetically elicited BEN density forecasts of world GDP growth, its variance, and
skewness decomposition are presented in Figure 6. This figure shows asymmetric confidence intervals of 40,
75, and 90 percent for the current, next-year, and two-year ahead horizons. The density forecast
illustrations‚Äîhypothetically elicited at the end of March and August 2015‚Äîprovide important information
about the distribution of risks. For instance, the upside and downside risks can be easily compared across
horizons. Table 3 shows the estimated posterior alpha coefficients used to derive the variance and skewness
decompositions. Results of the posterior series of the ex-ante variance and skewness of GDP growth for
three-year horizons are presented in Figure 7.
    In addition, na√Øve density forecasts are generated to benchmark the BEN-generated density predictions.
The na√Øve- density forecasts are constructed using historical semiannual World Bank point forecast series of
real world GDP growth and attaching them an uncertainty of magnitude based on historical forecast error
(HFE) standard deviations. The na√Øve density forecasts follow a normal distribution with a mean equal to
the most likely GDP growth outcome and HFE standard deviations. Two rules of thumb are used to generate
these na√Øve density forecasts: i) horizon-specific HFE standard deviations; and ii) average HFE standard
deviations across horizons. Illustrations of these na√Øve-generated benchmark forecasts can be seen in Figure
8.


4.3 Evaluation of density forecasts

The comparison of the Bayesian entropy-generated density forecast series with the na√Øve counterparts is done
via the CRPS scoring rule. Unweighted and weighted averages of the individual CRPS scores are also


                                                      19
estimated. The formulation of the weighted average is presented in Appendix 5. The ex-post performance of
the BEN and the na√Øve forecast series is presented in Table 5.
    The results overwhelmingly show better scores‚Äîlower values‚Äîfor the BEN density forecasts over the
na√Øve-symmetric predictions across horizons, months, years, and in aggregated form. The BEN-generated
density forecasts more accurately captured the uncertainty around world GDP growth. The CRPS scoring
rule indicates that the BEN-generated fan charts are more reliable than the benchmark‚Äîna√Øve‚Äîdensity
forecasts.


5. Concluding remarks


Informed decisions require to consider potential upside and downside outcomes. For policy-making and
investment purposes, predictive models that consider the modeling of asymmetric density forecasts provide
superior reliability and decision-advantage. In addition, the generation of forecasting procedures that allow
the incorporation and update of prior information‚Äîas per the Bayesian entropy procedure presented in this
paper‚Äîis encouraged to obtain more flexible models to enhance the reliability of elicited density forecasts.
Revision of established prequential systems is important in practice to enhance forecast scores. The proper
scoring rule framework is also encouraged to transparently track the reliability of the predictions.
   Assigning proper scores‚Äîlike the continuous ranked probability score‚Äîprovides strong incentives for
the forecaster to elicit his or her best and honest density predictions. Evaluation of density forecasts through
proper scoring rules provides transparency and the opportunity to distinguish the heterogeneity of forecasting
model accuracy and forecaster skill. The recording of scoring rule rankings will allow the comparison of
future predictions: forecasters and methods. This compilation of scores will help incentivize forecasting
improvements.
    A Bayesian procedure was introduced in this paper to systematically generate asymmetric density forecasts.
The methodology relies on prior information of parameters and unobserved statistics, expectations of risk
factors statistics, and a two-piece normal distribution assumption. The TPN distribution provides flexibility
for modeling the predictive densities. The method allows that selected risk factors, Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å, to depict the shape of
the density forecasts, i.e., the description of the uncertainty around the most likely outcomes‚Äîpredicted
baseline‚Äîof the target variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å.
   The introduced Bayesian entropy methodology directly models the variance and skewness decompositions
of the predictive density forecasts. The linear combination of the target variable, Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, and its risk factors, Ì†µÌ≤ÅÌ†µÌ≤Å,
offers a simple regression framework that exploits on the ex-ante variance and skewness information as a
proxy for ex-ante uncertainty of the target variable. The Bayesian entropy procedure minimizes information
noise among behavioral equations of the ex-ante global variance and skewness, the consistency constraints,
and the data.
   In the empirical application of predicting world GDP growth, the associated ex-ante market information
emerges from term spreads, absolute deviations of inflation targets, energy prices, and the S&P 500 index
prices. The recovered posterior series of the global GDP growth variance and skewness are used to construct
hypothetical BEN-generated density forecasts. These world GDP growth BEN-generated forecasts are



                                                         20
monthly-elicited across the period of October 2005‚ÄìAugust 2015, and are evaluated via the continuous
ranked probability score. The CRPS is a proper scoring rule that measures the reliability of the resulting
forecasts. The unweighted and weighted average CRPS scores show that the Bayesian entropy fan charts
outperform the na√Øve density forecasts, which are generated by a rule of thumb using historical forecast error
information and symmetric normal distribution assumptions. Noticeably, the estimated monthly BEN-
generated density forecasts for world GDP growth show predominantly negative values of skewness‚Äî
downside skewed density forecasts‚Äîacross the time span of October 2005‚ÄìAugust 2015. This spotlights
two aspects of the model: its easiness to incorporate prior information such as historical overprediction of
world GDP growth, and its ability to minimize noise under the relative entropy setup.
   This research could be expanded to include the testing of a variety of entropy measures to filter the
information among the target variable and the selected risk factors. Future work could also investigate the
quality and accuracy of the ex-ante variance and skewness information of the risk factors and its level of
noise‚Äîusefulness. It is hoped that the incorporation of better and more accurate ex-ante prediction
information will allow for the establishment of less noisy forecasting systems. Finally, the study of several
scoring rules and the dynamic tracking of their score decompositions could enhance the discussion of
forecaster skills.

Appendix 1. The two-piece normal distribution

        The TPN distribution for the random variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å is denoted as Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å~Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÔøΩÌ†µÌºáÌ†µÌºáÌ†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å , Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé1,Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å , Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé2,Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å ÔøΩ. The TPN
assumption allows the modeling of asymmetric distributional behaviors. Under this distribution, the variable
Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å is fully depicted using three parameters. For instance, the TPN can be entirely described by the mode, Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌºá,
the variance, Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé , and the skewness, Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌªæ . Or alternatively, it can be defined via the mode, Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌºá , the downside
standard deviation, Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé1 , and the upside standard deviation, Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé2 . Note that Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌºá ‚àà ‚Ñù, Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé ‚àà ‚Ñù++ , Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌªæ ‚àà ‚Ñù, Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé1 ‚àà
‚Ñù++ , and Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé2 ‚àà ‚Ñù++ . The TPN probability density function for a random variable Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å is defined in equation
(33), while its mean, variance, and skewness are stated in (34), (35), and (36), respectively. Under (33),
when Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé1 > Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé2 , the distribution of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å is skewed to the left (negative or downside skewness), which also means
Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã ‚â§ Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌºá) > 0.5. When the distribution of Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å is skewed to the right (positive or upside skewness), this
means that Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé1 < Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºé2 and Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ±É(Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ã ‚â§ Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌºá) < 0.5.

   The Black-Scholes-Merton model for option pricing assumes the log-normality distribution of the stock
prices. This assumption allows to consistently proxy the ex-ante variance and skewness of the stock prices.
The series of ex-ante variance and ex-ante skewness of the stock prices are recovered using equations (46)
and (47). First, note that the implied-volatility Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºéÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ,Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á+‚Ñé estimated from the Black-Scholes-Merton model
of option pricing is the ex-ante standard deviation of the stock price return Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºéÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü,Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á+Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞ª . Bloomberg assumes the
Black-Scholes-Merton model to computationally proxy the implied volatility from option prices. As a
consequence, Ì†µÌºéÌ†µÌºéÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ü,Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á+Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞ª is approached using the implied volatility of the stock prices provided by Bloomberg.
Second, the Black-Scholes-Merton model assumes a riskless portfolio consisting of a position in the option
and a position in the stock prices. In the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the return from the portfolio
must be the risk-free interest rate, Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ . Thus, the ex-ante expected return‚Äîimplied return‚ÄîÌ†µÌºáÌ†µÌºáÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±ò,Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á+‚Ñé , is used as
a proxy via the risk-free interest rate, Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ , which is taken as the 5-year Treasury Note Yield at constant maturity
collected from Haver Analytics.
   Finally, the stock price series are transformed as in the case of the construction of the series Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±å, Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌºãÌ†µÌºã , Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ±á .
This transformation aims to smooth and benchmark the variation of the risk factors in equation (1) as
explicitly stated in (2). The risk factor series of crude oil and the S&P 500 index prices, Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ú and Ì†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±çÌ†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±Ü ,
which enter equation (1) are generated using the transformation presented in (48).

Appendix 5. Weights of the average scores in the empirical application

    An example of the weighted penalization of negative oriented scores, like the CRPS, imaging the context
of monthly-elicited forecasts and annual materialized events. We denote Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö,Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ+‚Ñé as the weight for the
forecast released in month Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö ‚àà Ì†µÌ±ÄÌ†µÌ±Ä = {1,2, ‚Ä¶ ,12} of year Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ for horizon ‚Ñé ‚àà Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞ª , such that Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö = 1 denotes
January and Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö = 12 denotes December. To normalize the weights (penalization) system, it is assumed that
‚àëÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö ‚àë‚Ñé Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö,Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ+‚Ñé = 1 for all year Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ . Under this setup, a simple rule to estimate the weights Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö,Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ñ+‚Ñé , which are
used in equation (31), is presented in (49). Following equation (49), Figure 3 presents the values of the
weights for the sequence of months {Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö1 , ‚Ä¶ , Ì†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±ö12 } and a three-year horizons set Ì†µÌ∞ªÌ†µÌ∞ª = {0,1,2}.

December will be the more penalized month if the forecaster does not elicit accurate annual predictions.

                   FIGURE 4. EX-ANTE VARIANCE AND SKEWNESS OF TERM SPREAD AND ABSOLUTE DEVIATIONS OF A TARGET INFLATION

Notes: Ex-ante variance and skewness of term spread and the absolute deviations from target inflation are estimated with country data from Consensus Forecasts.
The global term spread statistics are constructed using fifteen countries: 1) Australia; 2) Canada; 3) France; 4) Germany; 5) India; 6) Indonesia; 7) Italy; 8) Japan;
9) the Republic of Korea; 10) the Netherlands; 11) Spain; 12) Sweden; 13) Switzerland; 14) the United Kingdom; and 15) the United States. The global inflation
statistics are derived using the twenty biggest economies in terms of GDP size: 1) Australia; 2) Brazil; 3) Canada; 4) China; 5) France; 6) Germany; 7) India; 8)
Indonesia; 9) Italy; 10) Japan; 11) the Republic of Korea; 12) Mexico; 13) the Netherlands; 14) the Russian Federation; 15) Spain; 16) Sweden; 17) Switzerland;
18) Turkey; 19) the United Kingdom; and 20) the United States. The global variance series are scaled down using the sample standard deviation of the original
series. The global skewness series are scale down using the maximum value of the corresponding original series.

Notes: Ex-ante variance and skewness of crude oil and the S&P 500 index prices are estimated via implied volatilities of option contract prices. The raw data is
taken from Bloomberg, which uses a variation of the option pricing model of Black-Scholes-Merton. The option contracts series are at the money. The variance
series are scaled down using the sample standard deviation of the original series. The skewness series are scaled down using the maximum value of the corresponding
original series.

Notes: The weighted scores use weights derived following the rule presented in (49); the closer to the realization period the more penalized‚Äîweighted‚Äîthe
forecast. HFE stands for historical forecast error. The ex-post monthly estimated density forecasts cover the period of October 2005‚ÄìAugust 2015. Forecasts
generated in 2014 are evaluated only with the realizations of 2014 and 2015. Forecasts gererated in 2015 are scored using realizations of 2015. Scores of na√Øve
density forecasts generated using the rule of thumb of a fixed HFE standard deviation across horizons were estimated and not presented in this table. However,
the scoring results remained the same: BEN density forecasts outperform na√Øve density predictions.

1. Introduction

    Many consumers in financial markets find out about the characteristics of products
exclusively from providers, even when their staff has better information about the cost of
the product and the incentives between customers and staff are misaligned. It is thus
important to ask whether firms are successful at providing information and ultimately,
whether consumers are well-informed.
    Two crucial pieces of evidence, however, should give us pause. First, financial
markets are characterized by substantial price dispersion (see, for example, HortaÃ§su and
Syverson, 2004, Stango and Zinman, 2016, GinÃ© and Mazer, 2017 and Zinman, 2015 for
a review).1 While the variation in prices may be driven by riskiness or the transaction
costs involved in servicing different customers, Stango and Zinman (2016) and GinÃ© and
Mazer (2017) find that the same individuals in the same months are offered credit cards
and credit or savings products, respectively, with substantially different interest rates.
Second, there is little comparison shopping, even when customers face substantial price
dispersion. Woodward and Hall (2012), for example, show that mortgage borrowers
overpay at least USD 1,000 by shopping from too few brokers.
    In rational search models, consumers expand their choice set up to the point where
the benefit of doing so is equal to its cost. But even when choices are provided at no
additional cost, comparison frictions may still cause consumers to place more weight on
non-financial factors like brand loyalty or non-professional advice from friends and
family to the detriment of the cost of the product (Bertrand et al., 2010). In addition, the
decision of which product to contract may involve unfamiliar concepts especially to
individuals with limited financial capabilities (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011, 2014) and as a
result, financial consumers may not necessarily choose the most cost-effective product or
the one most suitable to their needs (see for example, Gross and Souleles, 2002; Choi et

    1
       Table 1 in GinÃ© and Mazer (2017) reports summary statistics for estimated costs and yields of credit
and savings products, respectively, offered by a sample of financial institutions in Mexico and Peru. The
total annual cost of credit including usage fees ranges from 22.1 percent in Peru to over 225 percent in
Mexico. The total annual yield of a transaction account also including usage fees ranges from -14.5 percent
in Mexico to 0.8 percent in Peru.

                                                                                                          2
al., 2011; Duarte and Hastings, 2012; Hastings et al., 2013; Agarwal et al., 2013, 2015
and Campbell et al., 2011 and DellaVigna, 2007 for reviews).
   Governments and academics have focused on financial education as a tool to improve
financial wellbeing, but the efficacy of these initiatives is mixed (for example, Cole and
Shastry, 2010; Cole, Sampson, and Zia, 2011; Bruhn, Ibarra, and McKenzie, 2014;
Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014, and Fernandes et al., 2014).
   As an alternative to educating financial consumers, governments around the world
have tried to encourage comparison shopping by introducing legislation to improve
disclosure and transparency. An early example of mandated financial disclosure is the
Truth in Lending Act of 1968 which required that consumers in the U.S. be presented
with key financial terms for credit products, and standardized the calculation of certain
key product terms and disclosure formats. Peru and Mexico introduced similar disclosure
laws in 2005 and 2009, respectively.
   As noted by Campbell et al. (2011) and Loewenstein et al. (2014), effective
information disclosure should mitigate asymmetric information, reduce search costs and
encourage competition. But if consumers do not understand the information, its
effectiveness will be limited as they may believe that it is not relevant to their decision
making, or do not know how to use it. In a speech given in 2007, then governor Krozner
stated that â€œeffective disclosures give consumers information they notice, understand, and
can use.â€ From a political economy perspective, mandated disclosure laws are easy to
enact because they only require the provision of information leaving the actual products
unregulated (Sunstein, 1999).
   The fact that large price dispersion still persists, however, indicates that these efforts
may not have been successful (see for example Weil et al., 2006 or Lowenstein et al.,
2014). While disclosure regulation dictates what terms should be disclosed and how they
should be calculated, the actual design of the forms is typically left to the financial
providers. Their interests, however, do not necessarily coincide with those of consumers
and thus, formats are difficult to understand and not easily comparable. Online Appendix




                                                                                                3
OA4 contains two examples of market-designed key facts statements in Peru.2 The APR,
for example, appears around the center in the 10th row for one institution but in the top
left corner for the other. Other terms also appear in different places, making the
comparison between both products difficult.
    This study seeks to understand the role of disclosure formats in facilitating
comparison shopping for savings and credit products by low-income consumers in Peru
and Mexico. These countries were chosen because they both have similar levels of
financial access but have de jure regulations with different transparency requirements.
According to the market conduct index published by the Economist Intelligence Unitâ€™s
2014 Global Microscope Index and Report, Peru is ranked second while Mexico is
ranked 25th (middle of the sample of countries).3
    We implement a laboratory experiment in which low-income consumers were
assigned a profile and then incentivized to choose the product that best fit their needs
from among 5 or 10 products. In each round of decision-making, information about the
products was presented in a different format, including current marketing materials
gathered from financial institutions during sales visits by actual consumers and a
simplified key facts statement (KFS) designed using behavioral insights to facilitate
comparison shopping.
    Our results show that the simplified KFS with its standardized format significantly
improves consumer decision-making compared to the marketing materials currently
provided by financial institutions. The effects are however much stronger for credit than
savings products. The probability of choosing the cheapest loan increases from 42
percent using the marketing materials to 65 percent using the simplified KFS but it only
increases from 32 percent to 34 percent for savings accounts. One reason is perhaps that
individuals may not care about the total yield of the savings account and focus instead on
other characteristics. After all, a consistent finding from the literature on savings is that

  A product key facts statement (KFS) is a document that provides concise information of the key features
and risks of a financial product.
3
  Market conduct includes indicators of the capacity to protect the financial consumer, the content of
disclosure rules, the disclosure of product terms, pricing information and non-discrimination in the
financial service provision.
                                                                                                            4
the behavioral response to changes in the price of saving is not large (see Hastings et al.,
2013 for a review). Alternatively, subjects evaluating savings products may not have had
enough information as the lack of impact is concentrated in Mexico where the simplified
KFS did not contain the total yield earned by the savings account.
    We also find that transparency increases price elasticity. The price elasticity of credit
products is -1.04 using brochures and -3.19 using the simplified KFS, that is, about three
times as large. For savings products, the price elasticity is 0.02 using brochures and 0.03
using the simplified KFS, and the difference is not statistically significant. In addition,
non-price factors such as the (random) order in which savings products are presented to
consumers matter more when brochures are used rather than simplified KFS, consistent
with the idea that transparency allows individuals to focus on the price. Finally, we show
that financial education is correlated with better financial decision-making, but for credit
products, the effect of the disclosure format is about three times as large as that of the
effect of financial literacy. More importantly, the simplified KFS is particularly useful to
financially illiterate individuals as financial literacy increases the price-elasticity of credit
products by 58 percent when using brochures but only by 7 percent when using the
simplified KFS.
    These results, therefore have relevant implications for how government-mandated
information should be presented and its potential to influence choices and competition in
consumer finance markets.
    This paper contributes to the literature in household finance and other fields that
study the impact of disclosure regulations in various consumer markets (see Ben-Shahar,
2011 and Dranove and Jin, 2010 for a review). The evidence on the effectiveness of
disclosure regulations is mixed, and because there may be factors other than the
disclosure regime that change at the same time, it is hard to attribute changes in behavior
to the disclosure regulation alone. In contrast, in our controlled setting the same subjects
make decisions using the same information presented with a different format, allowing us
to make causal statements about the effectiveness of the disclosure treatment.
    Our evidence comes from the laboratory rather than the field. The advantage is that
subjects are rewarded to pay attention when making decisions. This increases our
                                                                                                5
statistical power considerably and may explain the magnitude of the price elasticities
found.4 The disadvantage is that the environment may be artificial as individuals typically
face competing demands on their time and attention when making decisions. In the field,
complexity can lead to inaction, as shown by Bettinger et al. (2012) in the context of
college financial aid applications, by Hastings and Weinstein (2008) that study school
choice and by Barghava and Manoli (2015) that study benefits of simplification in the
take-up of the Earned Income Tax Credit. More related to our context, in Adams et al.
(2016), for example, holders of low-yielding savings accounts were given information
about higher-rate paying products, a form that enabled simplified switching and a
reminder about their low rate. About 90 percent of study participants failed to take any
action when it was in their interest to do so. Perhaps more troubling, they did not even
recall receiving or reading such information. Similarly, Ponce et al. (2017) find muted
effects from information disclosures in the Mexican credit card market.
    Another advantage of field experiments is that they allow researchers to observe not
only consumer responses, but also how firms respond to greater disclosure requirements.
Duarte and Hastings (2012) evaluate a change in government disclosure in Mexicoâ€™s
privatized social security system and find strong evidence that firms find ways to
undermine the effects of disclosure reform by altering their fee structures. Anagol and
Kim (2012) also find evidence that firms respond to disclosure policy by altering
products to maintain lack of clarity in pricing.5
    The paper finally contributes to the literature documenting consumer financial
mistakes and the role of disclosures in preventing them. Hastings and Tejada (2008) show
that presenting the cost of a financial product in amounts instead of percentages allows
people to choose better products and to focus on other characteristics like fees. Thus,
echoing the findings here, minor changes on how information is presented can have
significant effects on decision-making. Related, Bertrand and Morse (2011) show that

4
  Beshears et al. (2013) and Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2010) also conduct laboratory experiments that
vary the presentation of investment fees while holding other fund characteristics constant to test whether
making fees less shrouded changes fund choice; both studies find however, little evidence to suggest that
changing the framing of fees has a large impact on investor decisions.

appliances.
                                                                                                             6
disclosing the cumulative costs of payday loans in amounts (rather than percentages)
significantly reduces the demand of such loans.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the
experimental design and the different treatments; Section 3 reports the empirical strategy,
Section 4 presents the results and Section 5 concludes.


2. Experimental Design

    Individuals from around the capital city of Peru and Mexico were invited to
participate in the experiment to test different disclosure forms. During recruitment,
individuals were told that they would earn money making decisions but no details were
provided about the nature of the decisions. Experimental sessions were conducted in
2013 in Mexico and 2017 in Peru. They took place in a room set up in a way to ensure
that communication between subjects was not possible. A total of 600 subjects in Peru
and 1,071 in Mexico participated in 57 sessions (10 sessions for each product in Peru and
20 and 17 for credit and savings, respectively, in Mexico), with around 30 subjects per
session (see Table 1 for details). Prior to the sessions, a subset of participants in Mexico
received SMS and live calls with tips about the terms that were important for financial
decision-making. In particular, prospective participants in credit sessions were told to
verify the total amount to be paid, including interest payments, commissions and
insurance premia. Participants of savings sessions were told to choose the accounts
offering the highest yield. Online Appendix OA2 contains the scripts to the live calls and
the text of the SMS. While there is an extensive literature on messages as reminders (see,
for example, Karlan et al., 2016) here we test messages as a way to disclose information.
    Subjects only participated in one experimental session that lasted between 1.5 and 2
hours. Each session started with a 20-minute survey, then three rounds of decision-
making in Peru and 5 in Mexico where subjects were instructed to choose the product
that best fit their needs, followed by an end-of-session survey. The initial survey included
questions on demographic characteristics, knowledge and preferences of financial
institutions, factors that affect subjectsâ€™ financial decisions, and financial literacy.

                                                                                               7
    Table 2 presents the characteristics of participants. Participants were stratified by
gender and they vary by education and occupation. Although Mexico is a richer country,
the Peruvian sample has a lower proportion of low-income participants (NSE C- or D).
For this reason, monthly household income is slightly higher in Peru (USD 641 in
Mexico compared to USD 783 in Peru) and participants seem on average more educated.
Participants in Peru are also more familiar with financial institutions and report higher
ownership of savings accounts and credit cards. In addition, less than one-third of
participants in Peru report comparing more than one product when they last contracted a
savings account or loan. When we correlate a dummy for comparing different products
against individual characteristics we find that richer individuals (as per their
socioeconomic status), those with internet at home and those that are familiar with banks
are more likely to engage in comparison shopping.6 While more than half tend to view
the staff and marketing materials as the primary source of information about financial
products, less than 15 percent of participants in either country is familiar with a key facts
statement. These individuals appear to be poorly equipped when deciding among
financial products (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011) and thus are good candidates for the
focus of this study. We note that there is within country variation in the levels of
education and financial literacy, a feature that we will exploit later when comparing the
difference in the probability of choosing the right financial product for a given participant
facing different disclosures designs to that of participants with different levels of
financial literacy facing a given format. Online Appendix Table OA1 regresses our
preferred proxy for financial literacy, which takes value 1 if the participant answered a
question about interest rate correctly, against other individual characteristics.7 Not
surprisingly, for the pooled sample in column 3 financial literacy is correlated with
household income, education and usage of financial products. It is also correlated with

 Data on product comparisons were only collected in Peru and therefore are not reported in Table 2.

 The interest rate question used is a simplified version of the one from Lusardi and Mitchell (2011): â€œIf you
deposit 100 pesos / soles in a bank account that charges you nothing and guarantees you a yield of 2% per
year, how much would there be in the account by the end of the year, if no deposits or withdrawals are
made?â€ Possible answers are: (a) Over 102. (b) Exactly 102. (c) Less than 102. (d) I donâ€™t know. (e) I
prefer not to answer. Lusardi and Mitchell (2011) use the timeframe of 5 years instead of one year.
                                                                                                           8
being a male, although it is not always him who makes financial decisions in the
household.
         Following the survey, the experimenter explained the rules for decision-making to
all participants in Spanish. In each decision-making round, subjects were first provided
with a sheet to mark their decisions. They then were given 10 minutes to record the three
best products on the sheet.8 Sheets were then collected after each round by an assistant
and inputted into a computer to calculate payouts for the round. After the end-of-session
survey, subjects were paid a show-up fee of 200 pesos (USD 16) in Mexico and could
win 100 pesos (USD 8) more depending on the number of correct answers. In Peru, they
were paid similar amounts using a voucher for a family meal in a popular fast food
restaurant.


    2.1 Task
         In each round, subjects received information about 5 or 10 products, each offered
by a different institution. The terms of each product were simulated using the dispersion
of values in the market. No pair of participants received the same combination of
products. Participants were instructed to choose the best product in accordance to a
profile randomly assigned to them at the beginning of the session.9 Half of the
participants were randomized into one profile and the other half into the other. In credit
sessions, all participants were told that they were going to acquire a 12-month loan with
monthly installments of 10,000 pesos (USD 800) in Mexico and 1,500 Peruvian soles
(USD 450) in Peru. In Mexico there was only one profile that mentioned that every
monthly installment was made on time. In Peru, half of the participants were randomized
into another profile where all monthly installments but one were paid on time. Put
differently, there was one missed installment but paid in full in the next installment. In
savings sessions, participants were told that they had a fictional endowment to be
deposited into a savings account of 1,000 Peruvian soles (USD 300) in Peru and 5,000

  We believe that 10 minutes was enough to make decisions without pressure. Typically, participants
completed the sheet with few minutes to spare.

  For credit, the best product is the one that yields the least total cost; for savings, the product with the
highest net yield.
                                                                                                                9
pesos (USD 400) in Mexico. Savings Profile 1 mentioned that each month participants
would make two deposits and two withdrawals of 100 Peruvian soles (USD 30) in Peru
and 250 pesos (USD 20) in Mexico each and two balance inquiries at a teller of the
financial institution. Savings Profile 2 in Mexico had no monthly activity, while in Peru it
was similar to Savings Profile 1 in that one transaction (withdrawals, deposits and
balance inquiries) would be made instead of two. The balance inquiry would be made at
an ATM instead of at a teller.


   2. 2 Treatments

   In recent years, both Mexico and Peru have developed a regulatory framework to
supervise and promote the use of financial services. Mexico enacted a law similar to the
U.S. Truth in Lending Act of 1968 in 2009 that also requires financial providers to
disclose the APR and APY. Peru enacted disclosure regulation in 2005 and in 2012,
which, similar to the regulatory financial transparency regime in Mexico, also defines the
criteria for the determination and definition of interest rates, fees, charges and yields â€“
including methods for calculating the total effective costs and rates for credit and savings
products. Current regulation requires financial institutions to disclose information to
consumers through brochures, key facts statements, webpages, ATMs, and verbally at the
branches.

   While disclosure regulation of most countries dictates what terms should be disclosed
and how they should be calculated, the actual design of the forms is typically left to the
financial providers. The goal of the experiment is to test alternative disclosure formats to
the ones developed by the financial industry.

       Each session in Peru had three rounds and in Mexico 5 rounds, each with a
different disclosure format. In Peru, the first disclosure treatment used marketing
materials such as brochures, amortization tables, and simulations that were offered to




                                                                                              10
prospective clients when shopping for financial products at the time of the experiment.10
These materials combined pictures with information about the terms, but each institution
had its own design, making comparisons across similar products difficult. The second
disclosure treatment used key facts statements (KFS) that institutions were required to
give customers after contracting a product. The SBS regulated the minimum number of
terms that had to be disclosed, but the design and whether to show the terms in fine print
was left to the financial institution. As a result, these market-designed KFS had different
layout of information, again making comparisons across products difficult. The third and
final disclosure format used a standardized key facts statement designed jointly by SBS
and us. This format presents the more relevant information in the top right corner using a
large font and because the information is standardized, a given term will always be in the
exact same place for every institution thus facilitating comparability. In Mexico, the first
disclosure treatment also used brochures. The second disclosure treatment used a
standardized key facts statement designed jointly by CONDUSEF and us that is similar to
the standardized KFS used in Peru. The remaining treatments used comparative tables
with either 5 or 10 products that varied the number of financial terms presented. The
complex treatment presented information for 5 products with 8 terms for credit and 12
terms for savings (Complex 5). The simple treatment also presented information for 5
products, but with 4 terms for credit and 3 terms for savings (Simple 5). Finally, the long,
simple treatment presented the same terms as the Simple 5 treatment just described but
provided information about 10 different products (Simple 10). Online Appendix OA4
contains examples of all the disclosure formats used in the experiment.
         The order in which formats were presented to participants was randomized in
each session to avoid learning effects. Given the objective of comparing the performance
of different formats, all materials had to have key information about the APR / YPR and
user fees to make the informational content comparable across formats. This meant that
terms of the product had to be added to the materials if these were missing in the original
one, which was typically the case for brochures.

10From all the marketing material collected by CONDUSEF and SBS, we chose the 5 materials with the highest
amount of information about the product.
                                                                                                             11
3. Econometric Analysis

          To examine the effectiveness of different disclosure formats for loans and savings
products, we first look at the impact of the different formats on the probability of
choosing the best product. We run logit regressions using data from Peru and Mexico
separately and then combined. For Peru we use the following specification:

                                                                                                                         â€²

and session k chose the cheapest credit product or the savings product with highest yield
given the profile assigned. í µí±†í µí±–í µí±ší µí±í µí±™í µí±–í µí±“í µí±–í µí±’í µí±‘í µí±—í µí±˜ and í µí±€í µí±˜í µí±¡í µí±—í µí±˜ are dummy variables that take value
1 if participants in round j and session k were given the standardized KFS or the market-
designed KFS, respectively. The omitted treatment is the one that uses marketing
materials such as brochures. í µí°¿í µí±œí µí±¤í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±œí µí±“í µí±–í µí±™í µí±’í µí±–í µí±˜ takes the value of 1 if participant i in session
k was assigned to Profile 1 described in the previous section. The vector of characteristics
í µí±‹í µí±–í µí±˜ includes whether participant i in session k is a male, whether he or she has post-
secondary education, age and age squared (divided by 100) and our proxy for financial
literacy. All specifications include round fixed effects í µí»¼í µí±— and standard errors are clustered
at the participant-session level.
          In Mexico, selected participants received either a phone call or a series of SMS
messages on behalf of CONDUSEF one or two days prior to participating in the
experiment. These phone calls and text messages contained simple information on key
financial terms that were used in the disclosure formats and would help participants select
the best product. Online Appendix OA2 contains the scripts of the calls and messages. In
addition, we follow the literature (Hasting and Tejada, 2008; Gigerenzer et al., 2003 and
Shu and Townsend, 2010) and varied whether the total amount to be paid for the loan or
the total amount earned in the savings accounts was displayed in peso amounts or in
percentages. In particular, the marketing brochures and the simple table with 5 products
had the total amount in peso amounts for participants with an even-numbered ID and in
                                                                                                                                                   12
percentage values for participants with odd-numbered IDs. In contrast, the complex table
and simple table with 10 institutions were presented in peso amounts for participants with
odd-numbered IDs and in percentage terms for participants with even-numbered IDs. The
simplified KFS designed by us with CONDUSEF always displayed the total amount to be
paid or earned in peso amount. This way, the same individual was presented with the
total amount to be paid (credit products) or earned (savings products) in peso amounts or
percentages depending on the format. Finally, a glossary explaining key financial terms
was distributed in half of the sessions. Table 1 reports the number of participants who
received the glossary and the messages or calls. Given these interventions, we use the
following specification for Mexico:

          In this pooled specification, we include country fixed effects and keep only the
treatments that are common in both countries, namely the simplified format and
brochures.

                                                                                                                                                 13
             Because individuals ranked the choice of three products, we can also run a rank-
order logit specification that includes the total cost of the credit product or the total yield
in case of a savings product. This specification is ideal to assess the price sensitivity
across treatments by interacting the price variable (cost of loan or yield of savings
account) with the treatment dummies. In addition, we can also assess how financial
literacy affects price sensitivity across treatments. Using data from Peru we run the
following specification:
í µí±‚í µí±Ÿí µí±‘í µí±’í µí±Ÿí µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ = í µí»¼í µí±— + í µí»½1 í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’í µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ + í µí»½2 í µí±†í µí±–í µí±ší µí±í µí±™í µí±–í µí±“í µí±–í µí±’í µí±‘í µí±—í µí±˜ + í µí»½3 í µí±†í µí±–í µí±ší µí±í µí±™í µí±–í µí±“í µí±–í µí±’í µí±‘í µí±—í µí±˜ âˆ— í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’í µí±–í µí±—í µí±í µí±˜ + í µí»½4 í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’í µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ âˆ—

             We can also use a ranked-order logit specification to investigate whether certain
treatments make individuals more likely to rely on non-financial factors like brand
loyalty or the (random) order in which products were received in detriment to the cost of
the product (Bertrand et al., 2010). We run the following specification using pooled data

4. Results

             Table 3 reports the coefficients from regressions in (1) (in columns 1 and 4) in (2)
(in columns 2 and 5) and in (3) in columns 3 and 6. The dependent variable is a dummy
that takes value 1 if the individual chose the best product. Columns 1 to 3 (4 to 6) report
the results for credit (savings) sessions. In all regressions, the first rows show the
coefficients associated with the disclosure treatments followed by the coefficient for the
profile dummy and the participant characteristics. The table also reports the mean of the
dependent variable for the omitted disclosure treatment (marketing materials) and the p-
value of a t-test that two different disclosure treatments are equal.
             Column 1 of Table 3 shows the results for credit sessions in Peru. The simplified
KFS increases the probability that individuals chose the right loan product by 12.6
percentage points relative to the brochures (and other marketing materials) and it is
significant at the 1 percent level. In contrast, KFS designed by financial institutions do
not significantly improve decision-making relative to brochures. The p-value associated
with the t-test that the coefficients on both disclosure treatments are equal is 0. The
coefficient associated to the profile is also not significant, suggesting that individuals are
equally able to choose the best loan product regardless of whether they expect to make all
                                                                                                                                                                15
payments on time or with one missed payment. We note that for 80 percent of all
products (including loans and savings accounts), the best product according to Profile 1
would not be chosen under the other profile so that choosing according to the profile was
important. Finally, none of the participant characteristics in Peru affects financial
decision-making, including proxies for education and financial literacy.
       Column 2 of Table 3 shows that in Mexico, the simplified KFS, the complex table
and simple table with 5 products were equally effective at increasing the probability of
choosing the best credit product by around 25 percentage points or by 64 percent (from a
base of 38.6 percentage points) relative to credit choices using brochures. Interestingly,
doubling the number of products from 5 to 10 eviscerates the positive impact on decision-
making as participants do no better with the 10-product comparative table than with
brochures. This result is consistent with the concept of choice overload coined by Toffler
(1970) and described in Iyengar and Lepper (2000) and Schwartz (2004).
       We also find that showing the total cost of the credit in pesos (instead of in
percentages) increases the probability of choosing the cheapest credit product by 8
percentage points, confirming the findings of Hasting and Tejada (2008), Gigerenzer et
al. (2003) and Shu and Townsend (2010). In contrast, the live calls, SMS or the glossary
did not improve decision-making. About half of the participants had heard about
CONDUSEF, and indeed receiving an SMS prior to the experiment increased the odds of
knowing about CONDUSEF by 25 percent. Participants received an average of 2.4 SMS
from CONDUSEF in the 5 days prior (and they recalled receiving around 3 SMS per
day). They received about 1.2 live calls from CONDUSEF. Despite the number of SMS
and calls, the message did not register, as it did not improve the ability to choose the best
financial product. Perhaps since they were not facing a teachable moment at the time they
received the SMS or call, they ignored the content. The lack of impact of the glossary
may be explained by the fact that it was difficult to understand. Online Appendix OA3
reports the glossary that was handed out.
       Among the participant characteristics, financial literacy is the only one that
contributed to better decision-making by 10 percentage points, but the impact of the
simplified KFS is 2.5 times larger than that of financial literacy. Column 3 of Table 3
                                                                                             16
presents the pooled regression comparing the simplified KFS to the brochures. These
were the disclosure treatments common to both countries. We find that the simplified
KFS improves the probability of choosing the best credit product by 23 percentage points
(p-value is 0). This result is remarkable because it indicates that the same individual can
improve his or her decision-making simply by using a different format. When we
compare individuals with and without financial literacy, we find that financially literate
individuals are 6.6 percentage points more likely to choose the right credit product. This
comparison is somewhat problematic because financially literate individuals may differ
in other characteristics to those that are financially illiterate and therefore differences in
decision-making cannot be solely attributed to financial literacy. By comparing the
coefficients, however, what is remarkable is that the simplified KFS is almost 3.5 times
more effective than financial literacy.
        While the simplified format significantly improves decision-making for credit
products, columns 4 to 6 show that this is not the case for savings products. The
coefficient on simplified KFS is positive in columns 4 and 6 but negative in column 5 and
never statistically significant. In column 4, the market-designed KFS does not improve
the choice of savings products (relative to marketing materials) either. In column 5, the
simple table with 5 products and to a lesser extent the complex table and the simple table
with 10 products increase the probability of choosing the highest-yielding savings
account according to the profile assigned. The simple table increases the probability by
17.7 percent or by 51 percentage points (from a base of 34.2 percent among those offered
brochures). Similar to column 2, when the yield is presented in pesos rather than
percentage terms, the probability of choosing the right savings product increases by 4.1
percent. Among participant characteristics, being a male, having post-secondary
education and correctly answering the financial literacy question improve financial
decision-making. The impact of financial literacy is again about half that of using the
simple table with 5 products to compare across savings products.
        Table 4 presents the results of the rank-ordered logit. In Peru and in the pooled
regression (columns 1 and 3, respectively), the higher the cost of the loan, the lower the
probability that that loan will be selected as the first choice. This suggests that individuals
                                                                                                 17
are price sensitive. More interestingly, in all of the credit-related specifications (columns
1 to 3), the interaction of the total cost with a dummy for the simplified format is also
negative and significant, suggesting that price sensitivity is enhanced by the simplified
KFS. Put differently, comparison shopping is enhanced with more transparent disclosure.
           Related, financial literacy also increases price sensitivity in Mexico and using the
pooled sample (columns 2 and 3, respectively). Echoing the results of Table 3, the impact
of financial literacy is however more muted than that of the disclosure format.
           Individuals also seem price sensitive when evaluating savings products (columns
4 to 6). In Peru, using the simplified KFS helps, but not in Mexico. Online Appendix
OA4 shows an example of the simplified KFS used in Peru (E) and in Mexico (H). While
the format in Peru includes the total yield earned in a month with two usage profiles, the
format in Mexico does not contain this information. This is perhaps the reason why the
simplified KFS is effective in Peru but not in Mexico. As a result, in the pooled
regression only financial literacy matters.
           Table 5 computes the price-elasticity from the estimates of Table 4. In practice,
we use data from one disclosure treatment and run a simple rank-ordered logit without
interactions.11 Columns 1 and 4 use the sample of all respondents. In columns 2 and 5,
the sample is restricted to individuals that are not financially literate, that is, individuals
that did not answer the question on interest rate correctly (í µí°¹í µí±–í µí±›í µí°¿í µí±–í µí±¡í µí±–í µí±˜ = 0), while in
columns 3 and 5 only individuals who correctly answered that question are included
(í µí°¹í µí±–í µí±›í µí°¿í µí±–í µí±¡í µí±–í µí±˜ = 1).
           Panel A of Table 5 contains data from Peru, Panel B from Mexico and Panel C
pools data from both Peru and Mexico. The price-elasticities reflect the results discussed
in Table 4. For example, according to the elasticities reported in column 1 of Panel C,
when individuals compare credit products using brochures, an increase of 1 percent in the
cost of the loan leads to a decline in the probability of that loan being chosen first of 1
percent (p-value is 0). In contrast, when individuals use the simplified KFS the decline in

 In particular, we run the following specification: í µí±‚í µí±Ÿí µí±‘í µí±’í µí±Ÿí µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ = í µí»¼í µí±— + í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’í µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ + í µí¼€í µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ . See Online
Appendix 5 for details on how the elasticities were calculated.

                                                                                                                               18
the probability is roughly three times as large at 3.2 percent. When comparing columns 2
and 3, financial literacy leads, as previously discussed, to higher elasticities in magnitude.
When individuals use brochures to compare credit products, the probability that a loan
will be chosen first when its costs increases by 1 percent declines by 0.8 percent for a
financially illiterate individual to 1.2 percent for a financially literate one. Similarly,
when individuals use a simplified KFS the probability declines by 3 and by 3.2 percent,
respectively for a financially illiterate and literate individual. Also notably, the simplified
KFS is able to correct differences in financial literacy by not only increasing the
magnitude of everyoneâ€™s price elasticity but also by making the difference in price
elasticity between financially literate and illiterate individuals smaller, in percentage
terms. Related, Online Appendix Table OA2 reports individual perceptions about the
different formats and their knowledge of the interest rate for the chosen product. As
shown in column 3, financially illiterate individuals are 17 percent more likely to
perceive the simplified KFS as being clear compared to the marketing brochures.
Similarly, in column 6 these individuals are 13.2 percent more likely to correctly state the
interest rate of the loan chosen.
        For savings products, the results are far more muted in magnitude and statistical
significance. In column 1 of Table 5, an increase in the yield of a savings account by 1
percent increases the probability of choosing that product first by 0.02 percent when
individuals use brochures to compare across savings products. When individuals use
simplified KFS, the probability of choosing the account first increases by 0.03 and the
difference in elasticities is not statistically significant. Columns 9 and 12 of Online
Appendix Table OA2 show neither differences in clarity nor correct recall of interest
rates between formats. Why are the results for savings so muted? There are a couple of
reasons. First, unlike Peru, the simplified KFS in Mexico did not contain the net yield
from the account to be earned in a year. Thus, while the simplified KFS in Peru is the
only disclosure format with a positive and significant elasticity, in Mexico the simplified
KFS is not at all effective. In fact, the price elasticity is lower than that of the brochures
and is not significant for financially illiterate individuals. Second, when choosing a
savings product, the net yield from the account may not be as relevant as other factors
                                                                                                 19
such as convenience, speed, familiarity and trust of the institution offering the product,
etc.
          In the context of our lab experiment we cannot explore convenience and speed of
service, but we can study other non-price factors such as the order in which products are
presented or appear in a comparative table in Mexico, and whether familiarity with the
institution offering the product, defined as a dummy that takes value 1 if the individual
has ever contracted a product from that institution. In the context of elections, Ho and
Imai (2008) use the naturally occurring variation in ballot order and find that being listed
first on the ballot increases the likelihood of being voted especially in primary elections.
Similarly, Luca and Smith (2013) study a change in the way universities were ranked in
the U.S. News and World Report and find that the ranking matters.
          Columns 1 and 4 of Table 6 show that individuals using the market-designed KFS
in Peru are more likely to choose products that are presented among the first three of the
five or that come from institutions that are familiar to the individual. When using the
simplified KFS, individuals are less influenced by these factors. Thus, in Peru
transparency increases price elasticity while familiarity and the order in which products
are presented matter less. In Mexico, neither the order nor familiarity affects the
probability of choosing a credit or savings product in columns 2 and 5. As a result, the
pooled regression reflect, to some extent, the results in Peru. Individuals are more likely
to choose products presented first when using brochures than when using the simplified
KFS.


5. Conclusion

       This study conducts a laboratory experiment to test the effectiveness of behavioral-
based financial disclosure by focusing on how comparability and the standardization of
formats can improve financial decision-making for low-to-middle income consumers in
Peru and Mexico.
       We find that a standardized key facts statement significantly improves the ability of
consumers to make financial decisions and suggests that regulators should not only

                                                                                               20
mandate certain key terms but also the format in which these terms are presented to
encourage comparison shopping and improve financial wellbeing. It is encouraging that,
in recent years, some regulators have begun mandating standardized formats.12
Interestingly, the standardized format tested increased the probability that individuals
choose the best credit product by a factor of three, relative to the increase in probability
between financially literate and illiterate individuals. More importantly, the standardized
format seems to â€œdemocratizeâ€ financial decision-making as it is particularly effective for
individuals that are financially illiterate. The effects are however concentrated in credit
products rather than savings. The lack of impact in savings is concentrated in Mexico,
where the simplified format failed to disclose the total yield of the savings account in
pesos, which may indicate that total yield calculations can be a useful requirement for
disclosure rules to improve consumersâ€™ ability to understand the cost or return of the
savings account.
     The laboratory setting approach taken also suggests an effective mechanism to test
the design of financial disclosure initiatives. This approach is not new. For example, the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Reserve of the U.S. constantly
survey and test financial consumers on how they understand information, which
information they think is useful, and finally how the information can be more effectively
conveyed (Kroszner, 2007). Interestingly, Online Appendix Table AO3 shows that
among individuals who showed up for a session in Mexico, those that participated in the
laboratory experiment (compared to those that were randomly turned away due to lack of
space) were more likely to report contracting the sessionâ€™s financial product in the
following 6 months. Owning a business and being a male were also positively correlated
with the self-reported likelihood of contracting the financial product.
     In addition, regulators in Mexico and elsewhere are requiring lenders to send detailed
product information in a machine-readable format so they can be downloaded by startups
like ComparaBien, ComparaGuru, and rocket.la which provide timely comparative

information to individuals looking for financial products. These channels also have the
advantage of being fully digital, removing the time and travel burdens to shopping
around, and making it easier to review and compare competing key facts statements on
the same screen at the same time. In the U.S., a similar initiative called â€œSmart
Disclosureâ€ was undertaken by the Obama Administration (Sunstein, 2013) to provide
sharable information so that intermediaries could help consumers make, for example,
better informed decisions about energy and health care.
   A final important consideration for the effectiveness of KFS is the timing of the
provision of information. The KFS is most useful early on during the sales visit, so that
consumers can quickly receive competing offers and compare across products. However,
sales staff may be incentivized to only disclose the KFS late, after the product has been
contracted. This practice will undermine the effectiveness of disclosure and the
consumerâ€™s propensity to shop around. Policy makers should therefore take care to
develop rules regarding the timing of disclosures and monitor compliance with timely
disclosure of KFS through mystery shopping (see GinÃ© and Mazer, 2017) and other
market monitoring tools.

Mkt jk denote the different disclosure formats. LowProfile ik takes the value of 1 if participant i in session k is assigned to Profile 1. 2) In columns 2 and 5, for Mexico, BestChoice ijk =

Simple 5jk and Simple 10jk denote the different disclosure formats. AmountPesos ijk is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if participant i in round j of session k saw the total
amount to be paid (credit product) or earned (savings product) displayed in pesos and 0 if in percentages. Glossary ik is a dummy indicating if participant was provided with a
glossary of terms during session k and 0 otherwise. LiveCall ik / SMS ik take the value of 1 if the participant i received a call/SMS prior to session k and 0 otherwise. LowProfile ik is
only used in regressions for savings sessions and takes the value of 1 if participant i in session k is assigned to Profile 1. 3) Pooling data from both Peru and Mexico, BestChoice ijk =
Î±j + Î²1Simplified jk + Î²2LowProfile ik + X ik'Î³+ Îµijk. In this specification we include country fixed effects. In all specifications, BestChoice ijk takes the value of 1 if participant i in round
j and session k has chosen the best product and 0 otherwise. Vector of characteristics X ik includes the following variables: male, whether the individual has a post secondary
education, age and age squared (divided by 100) and a proxy for financial literacy that takes value 1 if the individual correctly answered the question on interest rate. In all
specifications we use round fixed effects. Control treatment includes promotional materials (brochures, amortization tables etc.) collected from financial institutions. Standard errors
are clustered at the participant level and are reported in parenthesis under coefficient estimates. Levels of significance * p<0.10 ** p<0.05 *** p<0.01.

Îµcijk. An observation is a choice c made by each individual participant i in round j and session k. In all specifications, Price cijk is either the total loan
cost or the savings yield of the each product. Ordercijk takes value 3 for the first choice of individual i in round j in session k, 2 for the second choice
and 1 for the third choice. FinLit ik is a proxy for financial literacy that takes value 1 if the individual correctly answered the question on interest rate.
Control treatment includes promotional materials (brochures, amortization tables etc.) collected from financial institutions. Standard errors are
clustered at the participant level and are reported in parenthesis under coefficient estimates. Levels of significance * p<0.10 ** p<0.05 *** p<0.01.

Notes: This table reports the price-elasticities of the probability that a specific prouct is chosen first by an individual.
These elasticities are estimated based on the following rank-ordered logit specifications: Order cijk = Î±j + Î²1Price cijk +
Îµcijk. Each elasticity is calculated with correspondent data samples. An observation is a choice c made by each individual
participant i in round j and session k. Price ijc is either the total loan cost or the savings yield of the each product. yijc is a
variable that takes the value of 1 if the individual choses product first. Standard errors are clustered at the participant
level and are reported in parenthesis under coefficient estimates. Levels of significance * p<0.10 ** p<0.05 *** p<0.01.

Section OA5: Computation of price elasticities

            The elasticities are calculated based on the following rank-ordered logit specification:
                                           í µí±‚í µí±Ÿí µí±‘í µí±’í µí±Ÿí µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ = í µí»¼í µí±— + í µí»½ í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’í µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜ + í µí¼€í µí±í µí±–í µí±—í µí±˜
Following Beggs et al. (1981)1, the probability that a product is chosen first among 3 options is
given by
                                                               í µí±’ í µí±‰â„
              í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±œí µí±(í µí±ˆ1 > í µí±ˆ2 > í µí±ˆ3 ) = âˆ3
                                            â„=1 âˆ‘3                      í µí±‰í µí±š
                                                                               ,
                                                            í µí±š=â„ í µí±’

            where í µí±‰â„ = í µí»½ í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’â„ + í µí¼ˆâ„ where í µí¼ˆâ„ has distribution extreme value.
            The reported elasticities in Table 5 are estimated as follows assuming individuals choose
3 products:
                                                                                                             3
                   í µí¼•í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±œí µí±(í µí±ˆ1 > í µí±ˆ2 > í µí±ˆ3 ) Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…
                                                 í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’1                        í µí±’ í µí±‰1          í µí±’ í µí±‰â„
             í µí¼–1 =                             âˆ—                 Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…
                                                             = í µí»½í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’1 (1 âˆ’ 3            )âˆ 3
                              í µí¼•í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’1        Ì‚1
                                                  í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±œí µí±                       âˆ‘í µí±š=â„ í µí±’ í µí±‰í µí±š   âˆ‘í µí±š=â„ í µí±’ í µí±‰í µí±š
                                                                                                            â„=2

where Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…Ì…
      í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’1 is either the average total loan cost or the average savings yield of all products
                                                                                     Ì‚1 is the
chosen as first option taken across all individuals in all rounds and all sessions; í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±œí µí±
probability that a product is chosen first, evaluated at the average total loan cost or savings yield
of all products chosen first taken across all individuals in all rounds and all sessions;
í µí¼•í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±œí µí±(í µí±ˆ1 >í µí±ˆ2 >í µí±ˆ3 )
                             is the partial derivative of the probability that a product is chosen first with
       í µí¼•í µí±ƒí µí±Ÿí µí±–í µí±í µí±’1

respect to its total loan cost or the savings yield, again evaluated at the average total loan cost or
at the average savings yield.
            For each column of Table 5, we restrict the sample observations for a given format and
individuals with certain financial literacy level. In particular, columns 1 and 4 use all
respondents, columns 2 and 5 use the sample of individuals who did not correctly answer the
financial literacy question on interest rates, while columns 3 and 5 use only observations of
individuals who correctly answered that question. Standard errors are calculated using bootstrap
and clustered at the participant level.

      Notes: This table reports the estimates of the regression of a dummy variable that indicates knowledge of interest rate
      FinLit i on individual characteristics. Knowledge of interest rate is tested with the following multiple choice question:
      "If you deposit 100 soles in a bank account that charges you nothing and guarantees you a yield of 2% per year, how
      much would there be in the account by the end of the year, if no deposits or withdrawals are made?". Possible
      answers are: (a) Over 102. (b) Exactly 102. (c) Less than 102. (d) I donâ€™t know. (e) I prefer not to answer. Data
      come from the initial survey. *In Mexico, C-D socioeconomic groups identify low-to-middle income household. When
      pooling the data from Mexico and Peru in Column 3, we also include country fixed effects. Standard errors are
      reported in parenthesis under coefficient estimates. Levels of significance * p<0.10 ** p<0.05 *** p<0.01.

Notes: This table reports the estimation of the following specifications: 1) For Peru, yijk = Î±j + Î²1Simplified jk + Î²2Simplified jk*FinLit ik + Î²3Mkt jk + Î²4LowProfile ik + X ik'Î³ + Îµijk, , where i
indexes each individual participant and in session j . yijk is the outcome variable that takes the value of 1 if participant i reports clear presentation of the product or if he/she is able to recall correctly
the APR /APY of the product given in the last round. Simplified jk, and Mkt jk denote the Simplified KFS and the Market designed KFS. Low Profile ik takes the value 1 if participant is assigned to
profile 1. 2) For Mexico, yijk = Î±j + Î²1Simplified jk + Î²2Simplified jk*FinLit ik + Î²3Complex jk + Î²4Simple 5jk + Î²5Simple 10jk + Î²6Complex jk*FinLit ik + Î²7Simple 5jk*FinLit ik +
Î²8Simple 10jk*FinLit ik + Î²9LowProfile ik + X ik'Î³ + Îµijk. Simplified jk, Complex jk, Simple 5jk and Simple 10jk denote the different main treatments. LowProfile ik is only used in regressions for
savings sessions and takes the value of 1 if participant i in session k was assigned to Profile 1. 3) Pooling data from both Peru and Mexico, y ijk = Î±j + Î² 1Simplified jk + Î²2Simplified jk*FinLit ik +
Î²3LowProfile ik + X ik'Î³ + Îµijk. In savings sessions regressions, we assign all individuals in Mexico to profile 1. In this specification we include country fixed effects. An observation is an individual.
Vector of characteristics X ik includes the following variables: male, whether the individual has a post secondary education, age and age squared (divided by 100) and a proxy for financial literacy
(FinLit ij) that takes value 1 if the individual correctly answered the question on interest rate. In all specifications we use round fixed effects. Control treatment includes promotional materials
(brochures, amortization tables etc.) collected from financial institutions. Standard errors are clustered at the participant level and are reported in parenthesis under coefficient estimates. Levels of
significance * p<0.10 ** p<0.05 *** p<0.01.

Notes: This table reports the estimates of the regression of a dummy variable that takes value of one of the
respondent considers getting a credit or savings product in the next 6 months on another dummy variable
that takes value of one if the individual participated in the lab experiment and individual characteristics.
Data comes from survey taken in Mexico only. Data come from the initial survey. *In Mexico, C-D
socioeconomic groups identify low-to-middle income household. ** Knowledge of interest rate is tested
with the following multiple choice question: "If you deposit 100 soles in a bank account that charges you
nothing and guarantees you a yield of 2% per year, how much would there be in the account by the end of
the year, if no deposits or withdrawals are made?". Possible answers are: (a) Over 102. (b) Exactly 102.
(c) Less than 102. (d) I donâ€™t know. (e) I prefer not to answer. Standard errors are reported in parenthesis
under coefficient estimates. Levels of significance * p<0.10 ** p<0.05 *** p<0.01.

                                                Introduction
Context of this study on school construction.

The present school construction study is done in the context of a World Bank's broader study performed
in the context of Bank's reengagement in the Education Sector in Burundi, which has 3 components : (i) a
review of the implementation status of the Education and Training Development Sector Plan (ETDSP)
[Plan Sectoriel de Development de l'Education et la Formation (PDEF)] as regards basic education [École
Fondamentale] ; (ii) a review of the school construction programs for basic education with a special
attention on community-based approaches; and (iii) a feasibility study of a potential scale up of the
Performance Based Financing (PBF) pilot. The present study the second one in this list.

Objective of the Study

The objective of the study is to: (i) review the current status of implementation of the school construction
component of Burundi’s Education Sector Plan, the PSDEF, (ii) analyze school infrastructure needs and
consider the extent of the challenge (iii) take stock of activities of the various school building donors,
partners, and organizations, (iv) analyze the situation regarding decentralization in relation to school
buildings and the potential in this context of the impressive community dynamics observed in the country
and (v) identify opportunities which could help determine the form and content of a larger scale school
building program. It is also to (vi) examine the extent to which the Performance Based Funding (PBF)
pilot approach in the province of Bubanza and (vii) a Disbursement-linked Indicator Approach (DLI)
approach would be appropriate for a school construction program.
The mission

Le school construction study was performed during a World Bank mission in Burundi on February 13-24,
2017 by: MM. Serge Theunynck, school construction and community-driven development and Hervé
Rabakoson, engineer, under the lead of Mr. Simon Thacker, senior education specialist, head of mission;
in liaison with the experts in charge of the other studies including Mr. Maurice Mazunya, university
teacher and xxxx; and with support of Mrs. Sandrine Nininahaswe, program assistant. The study team
was received in audience by her excellency Mrs. Dr. Janvière Ndirahisha, Education Minister [Ministre
de education, de l'Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche Scientifique (MEESRS)], and by Mr./Dr.
Léopold Habyarimana, Permanent Secretary in the MEESRS. The mission worked closely with Mrs.
Malysie Hatungimana, Director of Basic Education, and Mr. Jérome Nyabemda, Director of the Bureau
des Infrastructures Scolaires, des Equipements et de la Maintenance (BISEM) and his team, in the
MEERS. The mission was received by the Conseiller Principal Chargé de Missions in the Republic
Presidency office. Working sessions were held with the General Director of Fonds National
d'Investissement Communal (FONIC), Mrs. General Director of the Agence Burundaise pour la
Réalisation des Travaux d’Intérêt Public (ABUTIP), and experts of the international NGO Cordaid and
the national NGO Association de Développement pour l'Intérêt Social (ADIS). The mission participated
in an information/coordination meeting with the international partners (PTF) that support the Education
sector, chaired by UNICEF with participation of PAM, CTB (complete list). Working sessions were held
with UNICEF the Embassy of the Belgium Kingdom. Working sessions on field trips were also held with
the Governor and the Education Provincial Directorate [Direction Provinciale de l'Éducation (DPE)] in
Bubanza province, and the [Directions Communales de l'Éducation (DCE)] de Shombo et de Gitega. The
mission visited the basic schools [Écoles Fondamentales (ECOFO)] of Notre Dame de la Paix et Bubanza
II (Commune de Bubanza), Kiange (commune de Shombo), and Rutegama (Commune de Gitega).

Methodological note. The structure of the pre-university education system in Burundi changed in 2012-2013. It went from 13 years
divided into 6-4-3 years for primary, lower secondary, and higher secondary to a new structure with 9 years of Basic Education
(École Fondamentale) and 3 years for Post-Basic Education. Basic education is organized into 4 cycles: I-II-III-IV, 2-2-2-3 years,
with the first three cycles corresponding to the former primary school, and the fourth cycle to the former lower secondary. In the
statistical yearbook 2014-2015, the data for Basic Education only goes to the 8th year because the reform only goes to that level
after 2 years of existence.


Growth of the School Network

1.1.     The total number basic schools [École Fondamentale] (public and private) offering the first
8 levels of education is 4,035 in 2014/15, of which 3,889 (96%) are public and 4% private. Out of the
total of 4,035 schools, 736, or 18%, are recorded in the statistical yearbook as having a double-shift
organization (p.70) 1. However, it is possible that this percentage represents only the schools that are fully
operating in double-shift, since according to the 2007 ECSR, 87% of sample of public primary schools
analyzed in this study were operating in double-shift, at least partially. In 2014/2015, out of the total
number of basic public schools, 2,727 schools or 70% offer primary education only, as shown in Table 1
below (the table stops at the 8th year because the reform introducing the 9-year basic education is then
only 2 years old).

                   Source: MEESRS. Data from the School Statistical Yearbook [Annuaire statistique scolaire] 2014/2015, p. 64


1.2.    The availability of Écoles fondamentales drops at the end of the 6th year. There are less than
half the number of schools offering the 7th and 8th year of schooling as there are schools offering the first
6 levels. This suggests that the distance between schools and dwellings increases significantly between
the third and the fourth cycle of basic education. It is likely that the increase in distance may be one of the
factors that explains drop-out by pupils at the end of the 6th year.

1.3.   Over the past 4 years (from 2012/2013 to 2016/2017), the total number of schools offering
primary education has increased from 3,774 to 4,135 schools, an increase of 351 schools in 4 years
or 88 schools per year, which is a considerable pace. Yet this recent rhythm seems much lower than in
previous years. Unfortunately, an analysis on a longer period is made difficult because the available the
data for 2016/2017 does not disaggregate public and private schools, and data available for 2005/06
provides only the number of public primary schools (2,132). To circumvent this difficulty, a reasonable
assumption is to apply for 2016/2017 the ratio of public schools out of total schools of 2012/2013 that is
97%. This gives a number of public primary schools of 4,016 in 2016/2017 that can now be compared to
the number of 2,232 public schools in 2005/06. Based on this assumption, the number of public primary
schools would have increased by 1,884 schools over the past 11 years, i.e. an average annual school-
building rate of 171 per year that is almost twice the rate observed over the past 4 years. This also
suggests that land acquisition problems for new schools have been well mastered in the past.

          1.4.    The average annual rate of increase in the number of primary public classrooms (Level 1-6)
          was 458 rooms per year between 2012/2013 and 2014/15, a substantial decrease of the increase rate
          compared with the previous period. Indeed, the number of classrooms of public primary education has
          only increased from 27,219 rooms in 2012-2013 to 28,134 rooms in 2014/2015, an increase of 915 rooms
          in 2 years. The comparison with the number of primary public classrooms in 2005/2006 shows that over
          the next 9 years the number of primary classrooms increased by 12,962 rooms, with an average annual

          1.5.    About one-third (32%) of the classrooms and almost half (48%) of the 2014/2015 classes
          [teaching groups or Groupes pédagogiques] operate in double-shifts. The number of teaching groups
          at the level of the Ecole Fondamentale (40,245) exceeds that of classrooms by 32% (30,421). The
          difference between the two numbers (40,245 – 30,421 = 9,824) represents the number of teaching groups
          that have no classroom, and therefore have to share one with another group. This number (9,824)
          represents the number of classrooms that accommodate successively two teaching groups in the same day.
          In other words, 32% of the classrooms operate un double-shifts. As regards the number of teaching
          groups that operate in double-shift with another group, it is 9.824 x 2 = 19,648, or almost half (49%) of
          the total number of the teaching groups. However, this situation affects only the first 6 years of education
          and virtually never reaches into years 7 and 8 where the ratio of groups to classrooms is nearly equal to
          1.2 In contrast, this ratio increases steadily as one descends from the 6th to the 1st year. Otherwise, the
          fact that the 32% classrooms that operate in double shift are located in 18% of the schools recorded to
          operate in double-shift suggests that double-shift classrooms tend to be concentrated in larger schools --
          these practicing double-shift have in average 13 classrooms/school compared to a national average of 6
          classrooms/school (2014/2015).

          (years 1-6) classrooms would have decreased significantly by 4%, from 29,146 to 28,017 rooms
          while the number of rooms in double-shifts would have increased by 18%. This analysis is based on
          data from the Statistical Yearbook 2014/2015 and the Municipal Statistical Data from the school year

          2016-2017 for cycles I, II and III. According to these latest data, the number of rooms for the first 3
          cycles (first 6 year) has registered a significant decline of more than 1,100 classrooms over the past two
          years. It would be important to verify these data because they are inconsistent with the fact that at the
          same time, 915 FCE-funded classrooms and at least 302 FONIC-funded classrooms were built during
          these years, (see Fig 3, para. 4.10), without counting more than 1,600 rooms estimated by the authorities
          to have been constructed through the "community works" (see para.4.8). If these data are verified, this
          could mean that very many classrooms in the first three cycles are actually used for Cycle IV and
          secondary, and that others, built of unsustainable materials, were carried away by severe weatherii, as the
          mission also observed in two of the schools visited. In any case, the importance of the decline in the
          number of classrooms calls for a more detailed examination of this issue.

          1.7.    Classrooms are overloaded... The average national pupil/classroom and pupil/teaching group
          ratios are respectively 71 and 54 as shown in Table 6. The average figure of 54 pupils per teaching group
          shows that classes are overloaded even after classes were organized in double-shifts (two groups in a
          single classroom, successively each day), which, as we have seen, involves almost half of the teaching
          groups. Despite the massive use of double-shift, the average size of the pedagogical groups are above the
          maximum standard of 50 students per class around which the construction programs are designed - as can
          be seen in the FCE-funded master plans. In addition, an average of 54 pupils / teaching group masks local
          disparities: if there are educational groups with a size of less than 54, there is also a correspondingly
          larger group of pedagogical groups (next para.).

and 60 students but is detrimentally affected above 60 (ECSR 2016, p.77).iii

Distance to school

 1.9.     Primary schools are still too far from children. Despite the sharp increase in the number of
 public primary schools between 2005 and 2014, they are still too far from children. In 2007, reducing the
 distance that children walk to school was recognized by the ECSR as necessary to increase access to
 education and reduce drop-outs. According to the 2002 QUID survey3, 42% of rural children lived more
 than 2 km (equivalent to 30 minutes) from school. The 2006 QUIBB survey found that 56% of rural
 children were living more than 30 minutes from a school4; and half of the parents felt that their children
 aged 7-9 were too young to attend school --which is a reflection of this same fact. Figure1 shows the
 position of rural children in Burundi compared to other African countries, based on the 2 km distance
 threshold used in many African countries as a maximum distance. In Burundi, the Ministry has more
 recent data but uses the 3 km threshold. In 2012/2013, one quarter (24%) of primary school students
 walked more than 3 km, and 5% of students walked more than 5 km. In 5 provinces, there are 30% and
 more to walk more than 3 km. The 2016 ECSR does not provide distance data, but indicates that by 2013,
 the proportion of parents who feel their children are too young to go to school is 45%. It also indicates
 that in 2014, only 13% of children started school at the required age of 6 years, 58% came in one year
                                                                       late, and 29% were delayed by 2 years or

Problematic of the Burundian school network.

1.12. Strategic planning choices. The distance from school to students’ homes and the size of schools -
which are the two sides of the same question - are at the heart of the problem of the future evolution of the
school network. The question is also to solve two major problems mentioned above, namely: (a)
decongestion of classes to allow for interactive pedagogy; and (b) the gradual elimination of double shifts
to return to normal daily teaching time. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to construct
classrooms: there are three options: 1) to build them in existing schools, but this does not reduce the
problem of distance between schools and dwellings; 2) build new schools, which reduces the problem of
distance but raises the problem of finding the necessary lands, and 3) a judicious combination of the two.

The status of facilities and hygiene in schools

1.13. A large number of primary schools are in poor condition. In 2005-06, it was estimated that
only 40 per cent of Burundi's 15,000 classrooms were constructed of durable or semi-durable materials
with adequate roofing, i.e. 9,000 classrooms of non-durable materials such as adobe bricks. According to
the ECSR 2012, only a little more than a third of the schools have all their rooms in good condition, and
the rest is a mix of good and poor condition. According to a preparatory study for the PSDEF in 2012, it
appeared that the classrooms constructed by the FONIC had many construction defects. The constructions
made in the context of the "community works" are of low quality and poor durability. It is reasonable to
think that the number of 9,000 classrooms in poor state has increased since 2005.

1.14. Hygiene in schools requires significant improvement. In 2005-06, it was estimated that
drinking water was virtually non-existent in schools. Nine years later, in 2014/15, nearly half of schools
(1,707 out of 3,889) have access to safe drinking water. This progression is impressive, although the
situation is still far from satisfactory. For instance, less than half of the schools with drinking water (742

schools) had handwashing facilities. At the sanitary level, 3,889 schools in 2014/15 had 30,072 latrines
for 2,166 million pupils, A ratio of 1 latrine for 72 students, slightly less for girls: 1 latrine for 75 girls.
However, of this number, only 22,603 latrines are in good condition which changes the ratio to 96 pupils
per latrine. These ratios are very far from the standards recommended by UNICEF and WHO that
recommend one latrine for 25 girls and a latrine plus a urinal for 50 boys. Statistics do not provide
information on the availability of separate sanitary facilities for teachers.

                               II. School construction needs analysis

2.1.       The assessment of total classroom needs comprises seven distinct elements:
          Additional classrooms needed to enroll school-aged children who are still out of school.
          The rooms to be added so that the average size of a teaching group evolves towards the goal of 50
           pupils, which is the objective for good quality of education;
          Rooms that are needed to reduce the number of double-shifting classes to 20% (two teaching
           groups per day in the same classroom);
          The need to replace non-standard and unsustainable classrooms;
          The reconstruction needs of the classrooms destroyed during the events of 2015 and
          Rooms needed to cope with future population growth, for example, during with 5 years.

2.2.   A bout 11,000 classrooms would be built if all out-of-school children of school age 6-14
would be enrolled. According to the ECSR 2016, 23% of children of basic age in 2013, (557,000 out of
2.42 million), are not in school. Using the ratio of 50 pupils per classroom which is currently used in the
standard plans, it would be necessary to build 11,140 classrooms to accommodate them if they should
have been in schools. However, this number is an absolute upper bound because the causes for non-
attendance are not only related to lack of supply but also to demand-related issues. In addition, other
options may be considered to reduce this number such as a more intense use of double-shift or alternative
methods of education.

2.3.    At least 2,250 additional classrooms are required in order to move the size of teaching
groups [groupes pédagogiques] to an average of 50 students. Indeed, the 39,511 teaching groups (in
2014-15) have an average of 53.8 pupils. In order to have an average of 50 pupils, they should be divided
into 42,500 teaching groups (2,166 million pupils / 50). That is to say that it would be necessary to create
2,250 additional teaching groups, hence to build 2,250 additional classrooms. This, without changing the
current rate of rooms in double shift.

2.4.    Approximately 9,200 additional classrooms are required to reduce double-shift instruction -
-an objective of the PSDEF. The plan aims to decrease the percentage of double-shifts from 57% in
2010-11 to 20% in 2020. In 2014-15, statistics show that 58% of teaching groups (TG) shared a single
classroom with another teaching group. In fact, there are 39,511 teaching groups, while there are only
28,011 classrooms, which means that 11,500 TGs do not have a classroom and therefore have to share
one with another TG. As a result, 23,000 TGs operate in double shifts, out of a total of 39,511, or 58%.
For this rate to fall to 0% it would be necessary to build 11,500 additional rooms; and to fall to 20%, it
would be necessary to build 4/5 of 11,500 rooms, or 9,200 rooms. The other option to cope with the
demographic increase is, in the short run, to continue expanding the double-shifting system, and in the
long run, to keep the girls in middle and secondary schools.

2.5.   Approximately 9,000 classrooms of unsustainable materials should be rebuilt. Classrooms
made of unsustainable materials do not allow for a secure teaching environment. They cannot be used
when it rains, reducing the number of hours taught each year. In addition, many of these classrooms are
destroyed every year during the heavy rainfall. This was the case of two rooms destroyed by floods in the

school of Kigondeka (Bubanza commune) visited by the mission. In 2005-06, it was estimated that only
40% of Burundi's 15,000 classrooms were constructed of durable or semi-durable materials with adequate
roofing, or 9,000 classrooms of non-durable materials. It is reasonable to think that this order of
magnitude is still current in 2017.

2.6.    Classrooms were damaged during the events of 2015 during their occupations of military or
police forces. A number are probably to be reconstructed, but there is no data available on this point6.

2.7.    At least 5,500 additional classrooms should be built from 2015 to 2020 to deal with
population growth alone. Estimates of the population growth rate are different depending on the
sources. On the basis of 3.28% / year (World Bank Indicators), the annual growth in the number of
children of basic school age, estimated at 2.42 million in 2013, is over 55,200 children per year, which
represents a little over 1,100 classrooms per year. In other words, from 2015 to 2020, the need for
classrooms grew by 5,500 classrooms.

2.8.    In total, an estimated nearly 38,000 classrooms Fig. 3. Assessment of the number of classrooms
would have to be built if all the above-listed need would              that needs to be built (2015)
be addressed. This estimate shows an absolute upper
bound that does not take into account the demand-related
issue, nor possible pedagogic alternatives, as earlier
mentioned for the estimation of classrooms related to out-
of-school children (11,000) that comes on top. Second,
comes the need for classrooms to reduce double-shifts to
20% according to PSEDF objective (9,200), and almost in
equal proportion (9,000), classrooms of non-durable
materials that need to be reconstructed. The need for
classrooms to cope with population growth for the next 5
years (5,500) comes in 4th place in the list. In any case, the
objective of this paragraph is to draw attention on the fact
that the satisfaction of all these needs requires the
construction of a number of classrooms whose scale is far Source: authors' calculations
above the quantitative objectives of the PSDEF and that of the support programs that are available to it.

2.9.    On the basis of current CFE unit costs, the corresponding amount to finance all of the
above-listed requirements would be about US$ 760 million or 570 million (at the official rate of US
$ 1700/US$) depending on whether double shifting is covered or not. For this calculation, the unit cost
used for a "classroom equivalent" includes the classroom, its furniture, the prorated sanitary facilities that
accompanies it, plus the cost of site supervision. It is taken from the average costs of the CFE-financed
MOC program that committed BIF 23 billion for the construction of 657 classrooms, at a unit cost of BIF
35 million per "classroom equivalent". Table 8 below further shows that the total amount would be BIF
517 or 389 million if the exchange rate on the informal market is used for the calculation. In any case, the
purpose of this paragraph is to highlight the importance of the amounts to be considered in order to meet
all needs.

2.10. The magnitude of the estimated needs of the above-list shows the importance of prioritizing
them. It is unlikely that the above-mentioned amounts would be mobilized in the immediate future. In
this context, what priority should be given to out-of-school children and to the question of distance home-
to-schools? Is it so urgent to reduce the practice of double-flow? Given their magnitude, is it reasonable to
consider the reduction of double-shift? Would it not be preferable to increase its expansion? In this case,
the priority may be placed on the limitation of the size of teaching groups, which has a strong impact on
the quality of education and students learnings, and to place a stronger priority on a further reduction of
teaching-group-size in the first levels. How urgent is the reconstruction of classrooms of non-durable
materials that are likely to be washed away by rain and/or strong winds? What priority should be given to
expanding basic education infrastructure to meet population growth? Perhaps would it be better to give
priority to the type of school infrastructure that help keeping girls in middle and secondary schools -
including hygiene arrangements -- as it is well established that this plays a key role for the demographic
transition. These questions of priority may be addressed in the process of developing a School
Construction Strategy as mentioned in Chapter VI (option 4)

2.11. The question of the availability of school land arises acutely because of demography, i.e. the
high population density in Burundi (400 inhabitants / km2), the very high rate of rural population
(estimated at 88% in 2016), and the high degree of population growth (above 3%). In this context of
tension on land, is it possible to build new schools, according to which practical modality ? This issue
would also be adressed during the preparation of a School Construction Strategy.

                     III. The role of decentralization in school construction

3.1.    The 2010 law establishes communal decentralization. The municipality [in French ‘commune’]
is now at the heart of local development in Burundi. It is headed by the Administrator and is responsible
for the Communal Plan for Community Development (CPCD) after consultation with the Communal
Development Committee (CDC). In the 2010 law, the details of the transfer of competencies are not
specified, nor the practical arrangements for the exercise of transferred powers. Highlights of the 2010 act
are summarized in Box 1.

Box 1. Municipal law of 2010. Extracts. The municipality is responsible for managing the local interests of the
population of its jurisdiction. It ensures public services that meet the needs of this population and are not, by their
nature, their importance or by the determination of the law, the direct responsibility of the State. The State may
delegate to it the management or the execution, at the local level, of some of the missions that fall to it. In this case, it
provides the necessary human, material and financial resources (Art. 5). The municipal council votes the budget, sets
the community development program, supervises its implementation and ensures its evaluation (Art. 13). The
commune is administered by the Municipal Council and the Communal Administrator (Art. 8) elected by the council
(Art. 11). The Communal Administrator directs and supervises all communal services and coordinates all socio-
economic development activities (Article 25). In his commune, the Communal Administrator represents the State
(Article 26). It receives a salary from the State and other benefits determined by the Municipal Council from the
budget of the municipality (Art. 29). He directs and administers the commune; he prepares the community
development section and monitors its implementation (Article 30). The "Hill" [in French "Colline"] or the Neighborhood
[in French "Quartier"] is administered by the Council of Hill or Neighborhood and the Head of Hill or Neighborhood
(Article 34) who is the animator of social peace and development in his constituency (Article 37). The Community
Development Committee set up by the Communal Council on the basis of a proposal by the Communal Administrator
is an advisory body composed of persons engaged in community development (Article 38). The Communal
Administrator transmits to the Municipal Council a semi-annual report on the state of progress of the communal plan
for community development -CPCD (Article 39). The Communal Administrator recruits the municipal staff, which
includes at least: a technical adviser in charge of administrative and social matters, a technical adviser in charge of
development issues, a municipal secretary, a civil registrar and a municipal accountant. (Articles 41, 42). The
technical adviser in charge of economic affairs and development: collects data for the development of the CPCD,
prepares and monitors the implementation of development projects (Article 52). Guardianship over the acts of the
communes is assured by the Provincial Governor (Article 96). Source: GoB 2010,

3.2.   Since 2015, the Municipalities are responsible for overseeing the construction of schools.
The law of 25 May 2015 stipulates that: "The municipality shall be responsible for the construction,
equipping and maintenance of communal public establishments for pre-school, basic, vocational,
secondary and higher education." (GoB 2016a, Article 7, Section 3, Chapter II).

IV. The Education and Training Sector Plan [Plan Sectoriel de l'Education et la Formation
                   PSDEF] 2012-2020 as regards school construction

                               IV-A. The context before the PSDEF (before 2012)

4.1.    During the crisis of 1993-2005 and since its end, a large number of initiatives were taken to build
school infrastructure. It is in this context that the PSDEF was prepared and adopted in 2012. The Section
IV.A provides an overview of these experiences before the PSDEF. Fig 4 illustrates them, categorized by
the implementation arrangement (communities, centralized, delegation to CMAs, Communes' direct
implementation of work contracts. The section is further divided into two main groups: on the one hand,
approaches funded with domestic resources and, on the other, approaches funded with external resources.

As Fig.4, illustrates, the 3 main implementation arrangements that were actually implemented during the
PSDEF period (in yellow) were already in place, long ago (5 years) before PSDEF starts.

A1. School construction with domestic resources:

4.2.   During the years before PSDEF, with its own resources, the Government focused on: (a) the
"Community works"; and (b) the Communes financed by the FONIC. The result is generally marked by a
poor quality of constructions. The details are as follows:

4.3.   The "Community works" (CW) was the largest part of school construction, but the quality
of work is low. This approach is a traditional way for the authorities to mobilize communities, which


                                                                    12
Burundi                                                                                            School Construction Study



dates from before independence and was dynamically revived in 2006 under the President's leadership
(see Box 3 below). Communities are mobilized on Saturdays. They provide local materials and carry out
unskilled work. The CWs are mainly organized by the municipalities that assist the communities with
their technicians, and as soon as the walls are erected by communities, mobilize the Presidential Initiative
to give the roof and so facilitate the building completion. In 2005-2012, the majority of school buildings
were the result of this approach. The PSDEF preparation report reveals that in some provinces, such as
Cibitoke, 80% of construction in 2011 was done this way, but they were estimated, however of limited
durability.7

4.4.     The community infrastructure built by the Communes with FONIC funds in the years
2007-2012 resulted in poor quality construction. The Fonds National d'Investissement Communal
(FONIC) was created in 2007 under the supervision of the Ministry of Communal Development. In 2001,
FONIC had resources totaling 4.5 billion BIF (equivalent to US$3.3 million). From 2007 to 2011, the
approach was a hybrid one: the municipality bought the materials by tender and financed the skilled labor
on the basis of a flat-rate envelope (3 million euros), while unskilled labor and local materials were
provided by the concerned community through CW. On visits, the PSDEF preparation mission found
infrastructure that was often incomplete. The mission felt that the quality of the works by the Communes
with FONIC funds was comparable to that of the CWs. In total, between 2007 and 2011, FONIC
estimated that 448 classrooms were built.8

A.2. Construction with external resources:

4.5.    Before PDEF and with support of the donor partners, the construction of school infrastructure
took several implementing directions according to projects. The common feature is a overtime gradual
convergence towards two approaches: a) the delegation to a Contract Management Agencies (CMA)
[Maitrise d'Ouvrage Déléguée] or MOD; and b) direct project management by Communes [Maitrise
d'Ouvrage Communale directe] or MOC. Details are the following:

4.6.    In the more distant past, projects were of Social Fund type: the Social Action Project
(BURSAP 1995-1997 and BURSAP-II 1999-2006) called Twitezimbere I and II, financed by IDA,
They were designed on the basis of previous experience of the EU-funded Micro-Development Project
(PMR). They followed the 1993-1998 crisis. As the PMR, they were "demand-driven" and implemented
by the Community Development Committees (CDC) through local competitive biddings or price
comparison. The projects were managed by an NGO named Twitezimbere. They were carried out entirely
during a long period of major unrest and insecurity that had begun in 1993. At the end of the first project,
which funded 256 schools, the average unit cost of the classrooms was US$ 64/m2, which was twice less
than those built in parallel by UNCHR, ARP, BPE, CEPBU, at 131, 103, 129 and 159 US$/m2
respectively, according to its ICR. In the second project the average unit cost of classroom constructions
was, according to its ICR, at 110.9943 FBU/m2 equivalent to 102US$/m2 (at 2004 exchange rate). This
was much lower than that of ABUTIPiv for similar constructions (162.427BIF/m2 equivalent to
150US$/m2). During this second project, the communities contributed 8.5% of the value of the buildings -
- corresponding to a total of 1.4 million days of work. However, this approach had no follow up.

4.7.     Then, in 2005, a centralized approach was tried for three years but had no follow up.
Following the Arusha Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation, a three-year plan for the reconstruction of
school infrastructure was carried out with funds from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
initiative. A thousand classrooms was built in 2006-2007 through limited competitive bidding between
constructors of the formal sector, for works packaged by provinces. However, the 2012 PSDEF
preparation report indicates that the awarded firms were overburdened by other large construction

contracts and tended to subcontract school construction projects to local small-scale contractors of the
informal sector. No evaluation of this experience is known.

4.8.    UNICEF's school building projects in 2008-2011 were directly managed by this agency. It
built 234 classrooms using its own funds and procurement procedures.

4.9.    The delegation to a Contract Management Agency (CMA) [in French, Maitrise d'Ouvrage
Déléguée or MOD] for school construction born in Burundi in 2007. Three projects starting in 2007,
2009 and 2011, financed by IDA and the Education Common Fund (FCE) used the MOD approach with
delegation to the specialized agency, ABUTIP. These are: (i) the IDA-funded Project to Support the
Reconstruction of the Burundian Educational System (SRBES/PARSEB, 2007-2012), which built 231
classrooms by ABUTIP at a high cost; (ii) the Public Works and Urban Management Project
(PWUMP/PTPGU, 2009-2014) also financed by IDA, which, among other basic infrastructure, built a
total of 127 classrooms with ABUTIP; (iii) support from the Common Fund for Education (FCE, 2011-
2014) administered by donor partners, financed the construction of 210 classrooms also by ABUTIP, half
of which were completed before the PSDEF.

4.10. In parallel, the construction of school facilities through direct contract management by
Commnunes (in French Maitrise d'Ouvrage Communale or MOC) also started in 2007. Three
projects starting in 2007, 2009 and 2011, financed respectively by IDA, AfDB and the Belgium
Cooperation (CTB), supported municipalities with the construction of school buildings through direct
procurement management. These included: (i) the IDA-funded Community and Social Development
Support Project (CSDSP/PRADECS, 2007-2012), where 652 classrooms were built by municipalities
throuh MOC, 3 times more than the PARSEB education project through MOD; (ii) the Job Creation
Program Support Project (CPSP/PAPCE, 2009-2015), also multisectoral, but financed by the ADB, in
which some 60 classrooms were built by the communes through MOC; and (iii) the Local Development
and Citizen Participation Project supported by the Belgian Cooperation in the Province of Cibitoke
(LDCPP/PADLPC 2011-2015), which financed the construction of 150 classrooms (among other
infrastructures) in the 6 communes of the Province. The objective was to support the creation of
communal skills for planning of their Communal Community Development Plan (PCDC) and to create
their competences for direct contract management (MOC)9. These new competencies were further
practiced under PSEDF with FONIC and FCE funds.

4.11. Table 9 presents a summary of data collected during the mission, regarding the number of
classrooms built during the ten-year period 2006-2016. Data in the upper lines allow, on the one hand, to
calculate the total of classrooms financed by the Financial and Technical Partners (FTP or, in French
PTF). On the other hand, bottom lines record data collected as regards classrooms built by communities
through "Community works" and these financed by FONIC from the domestic budget. The last line
records the number of classrooms drawn form available statistic from the Ministry of Education. Work
remains to be done to collect the missing data in order to complete the table and reach global consistency.

                            IV-B. The Education and Training Sector Development Plan (PSDEF)

4.12. The 2012-2020 PSDEF plans to build 4,769 cycle-I-II-III classrooms during the first 3 years
(2013-2015), i.e. about 1,600 per year. Annex 7.3 of the PSDEF (p. 28) detail: 1,706, 1,652 and 1,441
respectively for 2013, 2014, 2015. The plan also suggests that construction programs should ensure that
schools have separate latrines and water points. To this end, the PSDEF looked to: (i) pursue delegation to
contract management agencies (MOD); (ii) support direct contract management by communes (MOC);
and (iii) subsidize communities' classrooms. It aimed also to strengthen the programming and monitoring
capacities of BISEM (the MEESRS' directorate responsible for overseeing construction) and the
provincial directorates, with the ultimate objective of developing a national school building strategy. Box
2 below recalls the three main school building strategies.

Box 2. School building strategies of the PSDEF
[quote] "The Ministry intends to continue to employ the already active contract management agencies and to develop the
communal and community contracting for works, which are to become the main execution process [...].
       The Ministry intends to continue to contract with existing contract management agencies [...].
       The Ministry with the support of the Technical and Financing Partners (TFPs) will accompany and reinforce the Communes'
        procurement of works for school buildings. To this end, it will increase the technical capacity of the Office for School
        Infrastructures, Equipment and Maintenance (BISEM) [...].
       Grants for the construction of community classrooms. In addition to the Communes’ procurement of works for classrooms, the
        Ministry will develop a tendering mechanism to subsidize the construction of community classrooms. The latter will be based on
        the following principles: (i) eligibility criteria to ensure the proper management of the subsidies paid; (ii) a community request
        validated by the deconcentrated services and submitted by a Commune; (iii) mobilization of communities and communes
        contribution to complement the Ministry's grant; (iv) the requirement to comply with school infrastructure standards and their
        supervision, (vi) technical support and supervision by BISEM of the construction works, (vii) frequent and systematic technical
        and financial controls.

4.13. The 2012 Ministry of Education study on the modalities of construction of classrooms,
carried out in 2012 as part of the preparation of the PSDEF 10, proposed the following principles:
         Geographic planning based on four key standards: i) maximum home-to-school distance; ii)
          maximum size of a school; (iii) the minimum population for the opening of a school and (iv) a
          minimum package of infrastructure;
         Three parallel approaches to contract for works: (i) delegation of procurement and management
          to executing agencies (MOD); (ii) direct contract management by communes (MOC); and (iii)
          delegation to communities;
         Empowerment of grassroots communities in identifying the need, formulation and monitoring of
          the school sub-project. Inclusion of the approach into the process of municipal decentralization;
         Use of standard construction plans for classrooms and associated buildings to: (i) optimize cost /
          quality; (ii) 25-year durability; and (iii) minimum lighting, ventilation and standard area/pupil;
         Compliance with the Government's environmental risk management plan;
         Transparency of operations at all levels and at all stages.

                  IV-C. School construction under PSDEF during 2013-2017

4.14. Actually, from 2013 onwards, school constructions planned in the PSDEF were essentially carried
out in accordance with the following pre-existing approaches: "Community works" (CW), community
initiatives, delegation to contract management agencies (the MOD approach), Communal direct contract
management (the MOC approach), while a new approach to educational development also appeared: the
Performance-Based Financing (FBP), within which certain communities used the FBP to build school
infrastructure. However, although the two first implementation approaches MOD and MOC initially
planned in the PSEDF were actually implemented by the Ministry of Education, it did not initiate the
exploration of the third approach, namely the delegation of procurement of works to communities through
the BISEM supervision, The details of the approaches actually implemented during the PSEDF period are
summarized below. As for the previous period, they are organized in two groups according whether they
are financed on domestic or on external resources.

C1. Construction on domestic resources

Community-based approaches

4.15. A large part of the new school buildings constructed since 2013 are the result of the
"Community Works" (CW). The scope of this program is impressive and its impact easily visible in the
landscape by the blue color of the roofs provided by the Presidential initiative. According to data from the
Planning and Evaluation Office of the Ministry of Education, the average annual number of rooms erected
through CW between 2012 and 2015 was 976. According to the person in charge of the program at the
Presidency, 1,479 Class were built in 2016 through CW. However, in the last year, a large number of
these classrooms were built for municipal TVET centers that are presently receiving priority
consideration from authorities, making difficult to assess how many classrooms were actually primary of
basic education ones. The annual budget allocated by the Presidency is about 2 billion BIF.11

4.16. As mentioned above, CW are organized by the State and/or the municipalities to mobilize local
populations in order to carry out works of collective interest -- such as school construction. They take
place every Saturdays, and any active person native to the concerned local community should participate.
These works are of all types, roads, ditches, etc., but schools constitute the greater part of them. Members
of the community bring in local materials (foundation-stones, fired-bricks for walls, materials for floors
and mortars, lumber and joinery), and provide labor (by digging foundations, mounting walls). The
commune supplies the cement and the mason who oversees building. Roofing sheets and other finishing
materials are provided to the communities through the "President's Initiatives" program. To this end, the
municipality puts together a file with photos of the infrastructure reaching having reached wall
completion), and transmits it, via the provincial authorities, to the above-mentioned program that, in turn,
provides the roofs.

Box 3. Burundi's "community development work" is a population mobilization practice that other countries in the Central
African region have known or are still familiar with: the Harambee system (“Pull all together? in Swahili) in Kenya, Salongo in Zaire,
Bega kwa bega yards (shoulder to shoulder) in Tanzania, Umuganda in Rwanda. They are based on national traditions of mutual
assistance and were promoted by the leaders of the newly independent states in the 1960s or 1970s with a view to a philosophy of
mobilizing citizens. In general, administrative and political executives are responsible for the coordination and coordination of the
work to which all citizens of the locality have to participate. Symbolically, the Head of State sets an example. In Burundi, this
approach is currently the subject of an active and ongoing national policy, the legal framework of which dates from the 1979 decree-
laws.12

community initiatives that are entirely managed
by communities organized around their school's
management committee. The mission found it in
almost all schools visited. The community supplies
the local raw materials, transportation, and
contributes to the cost of bricks. This construction
is of the same quality as those of the CWs, when
the walls are made of fired-brick, or less good when
they are made of adobe bricks (bricks of dried
clay), as in the construction of the upper right of

A new communal approach: FONIC

4.20. During the PSDEF period, the FONIC financed municipalities for the realization through
direct contract management (MOC) of approximately 150 classrooms per year in 2013 and 2014,
and 1,479 classrooms in 2016. Education is clearly the priority of the municipalities. In 2014, for
example, they allocated 55% of their budget to the education sector out of the non-earmarked [non-
affecté] 6.45 billion BIF envelope. Of this amount, the largest share (54%) went to the construction of 150
new rooms (average unit cost 12.75 million BIF), the second (17%) financed the supply of materials for
167 classrooms. In 2016, thanks to the tenfold increase in the allocation of the FONIC (59.5 billion BIF),
the communes built 1,017 classrooms.13 That said, the available documentation does not say the number
built for Basic Education, Post-Basic, or TVET. A succinct description of FONIC is provided below in
Box 3.

Box 3. The FONIC. The Fonds National d’Investissement Communal was created in 200714 with the assistance of the GIZ et la
CTS15. It is a public institution of an administrative nature governed by public law, with legal and management autonomy, under the
supervision of the Ministry in charge of decentralization. Its objective is to channel domestic and external financing to local
authorities, to ensure the equalization of resources to municipalities, and to support the implementation of communal projects.
Funds are channeled to communes through two types of widows: a non-earmarked window [guichet non-affecté] and several
windows earmarked for specific sectors [guichets affectés]. Its Operation Manual was revised in 2013, i.e. the same year the
PSEDF started.


4.21. The FONIC's budget is increasing and the method of operation of the communes with
FONIC funds has improved: since 2013 onwards, the municipalities are bidding for complete
works. In 2014 and 2015, FONIC was allocated BIF 3.5 and 6.5 billion, respectively, under the "non-
allocated window", i.e. approximately BIF 27 and 50 million per commune respectively, and BIF 800 and



                                                                                  18

  500 million respectively under of the earmarked window [guichet affecté] for education guichet ]. In
  2016, the budget of the non-earmarked widow office increased tenfold to BIF 59. 5 billion, while its
  Procedures Manual was revised in 2013 so that the municipalities would issue full-work calls for tender,
  abandoning the previous hybrid procedure Box 4 summarizes some key elements of the Operation
  Manual

  Box 4. The FONIC's Operation Manual (OP) of 2013. The communes draw up a project preliminary proposal [dossier d'avant
  projet] which they submit to the FONIC. Once approved, a financing agreement is signed between FONIC and the municipality and
  the budget is transferred to the municipality's account. The initial version of the 2007 MOP was revised in 2013 with support of GIZ,
  drawing on the FADL procedures manual created in 2011 by the BTC-funded PADLPC. As in the FADL, in the new version of the
  FONIC MOP of 2013, municipalities are now bidding for complete works following the Public Procurement Code. The tools of the
  FONIC's monitoring system now count the number of classrooms constructed, rehabilitated, completed, and / or equipped, as well
  as the number of latrine blocks.


  4.22. FONIC uses the standard classroom-block plan provided by the Ministry of Education. A
  set of classrooms (a block) consists of 3 classrooms of 6.72x8.72m, or 58.60 m2, for a theoretical
  occupation of 50 students (25 table-benches) per class, which corresponds to a unit space of 1.17m2 per
  pupil --low for interactive pedagogy. See Figure 9. The block also includes a front veranda. The plan in
  Fig. 9a shows: a) the presence of a platform in front of the blackboard, which is not recommended
  because it hinders the movement in a wheelchair; and (b) the indication of expansion joints in the floor
  slab, which is an excellent and necessary specification -- but which is so seldom included in other projects
  that it should be emphasized here. The cross- section in Fig. 9b shows two reinforced concrete rows
  (bottom and top), which, together with the concrete columns of angles and stiffening of the facades,
  constitutes an armature sufficient to make the constructions para-seismic for seismic shocks of average
  amplitude. However, it is also noted that: (a) the interior level of the rooms is only 15 cm above the
  outside floor, which creates a vulnerability to the entry of runoff water during very heavy rain; and (b)
  there is no ramp to pass from the interior floor to that of the veranda to facilitate access for students in
  wheelchairs.

  4.23. The standard plan for the sanitary block could be improved (Fig 11b). It has 4 cabins, 2 for
  each sex, with different entrances by sex but side by side. The cabins are on single pit type. The device
  has four disadvantages: (a) even with separate entrances, the contiguity of girls’ and boys’ sanitary
  facilities is not recommended; it is advised that the girls’ block should be geographically distant from that
  of boys in order to reduce the risk of harassment which tends to reduce in turn the use of sanitary facilities
  by girls; b) the pit system is ventilated, which is in conformity with standard requirements, but it does not
  allow manual emptying and is therefore not suitable for schools where the dual pit system alternatively
  used is preferable; (c) the sanitary facilities are not suitable for use by children with a physical handicap;
  and, d) there is no handwashing facility.

4.24. The average unit cost of classrooms built by municipalities in 2014 with FONIC funding is
low compared to international costs. It is BIF 14.3 million per classroom (2014) equivalent to US$
8,090 per classroom or 126 US$/m2 (excluding tax, value 2016$). This total cost, including the direct cost
of works (enterprise contract) and the indirect cost of the service provided by the site
controller/supervisor; however, it does not include the cost of FONIC for the financial management of the
program. The cost of project management is one of the sites for which data were available was US$18/m2,
i.e. 17.6% of the direct cost of the work to be supervised, which is, on the other hand, a high rate per
project in comparison with international standards for this service (see details of calculations in Annex 1).

US$/m2. The price difference between the two contracts is large: from 83 to 121 US$/m2. However, this
on-the-spot review of only 2 contracts corresponding to 6 classrooms are not as representative of the

4.26. The quality of the work financed by the FONIC has not been evaluated. There is no technical
audit or technical supervision report available. Under the FONIC funds, municipalities use the services of
a technical supervisor to controller the works, which is good practice. It would be useful for the FONIC to
have a technical audit of the buildings it finances.

C2. School construction financed by donor support

The Common Fund for Education [Fonds Commun de l'Education] FCE

4.27. The FCE (common pooled fund), UNICEF and Belgium through the FADLv were the most
important partners for school building during the PSDEF. The FCE includes funds from AFD, DFID,
Norway, and Luxembourg, and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). The FCE mainly financed
basic education up to 75% of the sector's expenditure from 2010 to 2014, and secondary and technical
education to a much lesser extent. In terms of construction, the FCE financed two of the three modalities
planned by the PSDEF, namely the direct contract management by communes [Maîtrise d'ouvrage
communale (MOC)] and the delegation of contract management to agencies [Maîtrise d'ouvrage déléguée

(MOD)], though excluding the 3rd modality which was the delegation to communities. The 2013 FCE
program was shared between the first approach (MOC) for 20 communes (6 billion BIF) and the second
approach (MOD) with ABUTIP for 38 basic education schools (14.5 billion BIF). The 2014 FCE program
(BIF 20 billion) was entirely devoted to financing the MOC approach. The 2015 crisis led to the
withdrawal of donors and the suspension of the FCE, but the GPE remained active in Burundi. In 2016,
keeping the same priorities, the remaining GPE financing was restructured and its management
transferred to UNICEF, which incorporated this responsibility to its PACEF projectvi. The next potential
donation of the GPE will be administered by the AFD.16

Box 5. The Common Fund for Education (FCE). This fund was established in 2009 by a group of PTFs to support Education with
a Manual of Procedures inspired form this of the IDA-financed PARSEB and revised in 2010 to implement the Budget d'affectation
Spéciale (BAS) created in 2010, isolated from the general budget to receive FCE funds. As of 2011, the FCE, financed by the
Belgian Cooperation, AFD, DFID, Norway and Luxembourg, was chosen to receive GPE funds in 2012. The funds were
administered by CTB while UNICEF was the coordinating agency. The rules of the FCE are described in the document of the
Belgian Cooperation for the GPE (2012). A more recent detail of the procedures is described in the Manual of Procedures of the
Common Fund for Education in Burundi - Revised January 2014.


4.28. The operational modalities of the FCE (common pooled funding) are set out in its 2014
Procedures Manual prepared jointly by the relevant PTFs and the Government. The FCE is under
the authority of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education. Available resources are determined
annually by the PTFs upstream of the Department's budget framework and are housed in a special budget
(BAS). Operation arrangements for school construction are of two types: (a) either under the
responsibility of municipalities through direct contract management (MOC), funded though financing
agreements A or B, depending on whether they have to build 3 classrooms or more. In such cases,
municipalities are responsible for the management of procurement and contracts for works, equipment,
and services of supervision/control; or (b) delegation to contract management agencies which contracts
are procured under the responsibility of the Ministry's Public Procurement Management Unit (CGMP) as
all other contracts funded by the FCE. All procurement procedures are those of the 2008 Public
Procurement Code. The funding PTF’s in the FCE to provide a priori no-objection notices (NOAs) on
contracts for buildings outside communal works. A 2014 ordinance raised the minimum threshold of a
priori non-objections for construction contracts to 250 million BIF. Supervision of the construction
program is carried out by BISEM. The FCE's financial supervision is done monthly, and the technical
monitoring and financing report (RSTF) is semi-annual and consolidated annually. Contacts are signed
with tax, and the VAT is reimbursed by OBR to the Ministry of Education.

Delegation of contract management to ABUTIP (MOD)

4.29. As part of the PSDEF (2013-2016), ABUTIP has built 480 basic education classrooms
funded by the FCE and is also completing the PTPGU project started in 2010. ABUTIP implements the
programs entrusted to it in accordance with its own Procedure Manual for Procurement of Works and
Contracts. The agency has adopted the construction plans used by the Ministry of Education.

Box 6. ABUTIP is an AGETIP-type contract management agency, created with a private NGO status in 2003, as part of an IDA-
funded project and member of the AFRICAP network. Members of the General Assembly are government agencies and NGOs. It is
headed by a Director General appointed by the Government. Like all agencies of this type, ABUTIP has its own Procedural Manual
whose initial version received no objection from IDA.


4.30. The standard ABUTIP construction design is almost identical to that of the FONIC. As
illustrated in Figures 9b and 10b, the design and the plan dimensions are identical. The three differences
are: (a) the position of the cabinet, to the right of the table for the FONIC and to the left for the ABUTIP,
which leads to a difference in the positioning of the windows on the main façade, (b) the exiting platform
(not recommended) in the FONIC plan that does not exist in the ABUTIP plan, and (c) the obligation of

4.31. The standard ABUTIP sanitary block is greater than that of the FONIC and includes the
essential elements. As illustrated in Fig 11a, it has 8 cabins, 4 for each sex, with entries by sex on
opposite facades. For each sex, one of the cabins is well arranged (size, grab bars, and seat) for use by
children with reduced mobility. There is a hand-washing arrangement. However, this sanitation facility
has two of the disadvantages present in FONIC: (a) the sanitary facilities for girls and boys are in the
same block, rather than in two geographically separate blocks, and (b) the cabins are on a single VIP pit,
which does not allow manual emptying and is therefore not appropriate in rural areas (see ASCQE 2.7).

4.32. The average unit cost of classrooms built by ABUTIP is 25 M BIF duty-free per classroom
in 2013, corresponding to 16,683 US $/clrm or 264 US$/m2 (2016US$). This unit cost includes cost for
work (work contract), service for control, and service for delegated contract management (agency's fee is
6% of the amounts managed). The data are an average of the 30 schools of the ABUTIP FCE-II program.

4.33. The unit cost of the ABUTIP classrooms is subtantially
higher than that of the municipal works on FONIC funds (126
US$/m2). However, the buildings that managed ABUTIP are
chosen from schools that present the greatest implantation
difficulties (the most steep slopes), which increases the unit costs
compared to what they would be in less topographically difficult
terrain. Fig. 12 illustrates such a condition. A detailed analysis -
but not possible in this study - would be to isolate the cost of
buildings (with a fixed design standard) from those of adaptation
to land adaptation and land development (which is dependent on
topography).                                                                                          Source: Photo Theunynck 2017



Contract management delegation (MOD) to UNICEF

4.34. UNICEF had constructed 63 classrooms (and associated latrines / water points) as project
owner (2013-2015) and 382 classrooms as MOD during the PSDEF period (2013-2017). The MOD
management program consists of 2 parts: (i) 162 classrooms in 2015-2017 under FCE funds as part of the
initial plan of the PSDEF; and (ii) 157 classrooms when UNICEF became the GPE manager instead of the
CTB. This last wave of construction was then integrated by UNICEF in its PACEF project (Program of
Support to the Consolidation of Fundamental Teaching). Then, procurement for works and services for
technical supervision/control are performed in accordance with its own procurement procedures.

4.35. The UNICEF classroom plan is very similar to
that of the Ministry of Education. The design is also based
on a block of 3 classrooms with a net area 1m2 larger than
this of ABUTIP and FONIC due to slighlty larger classroons
(16 cm more). The width of the veranda is slightly smaller.
Classrroms are equipfed with false-ceilings. A complete
school consists of 9 classrooms, 2 latrine blocks with 5
cabins each and a drinking water point (water supply /
drilling) and the rainwater harvesting system.

4.36. The sanitary block is well designed (Fig 11c). It is composed of 5 cabins. Four of them are upon
double-alternating pits which allows safe waste management over time, and the last cabin is specifically
equipped for children with physical disabilities, two essential characteristics that the 2 other models of
ABUTIP and FONIC do not have. The desirable improvements are: a) embossed footrests in the 4
standard cabins; and (b) a larger size for the box used by children living with a physical handicap to allow
wheelchair entry. However, this box should be larger because, according to this drawing, the wheelchair
must remain outside, obliging the user to depend on personal assistance to get in. The block also includes
a hand-washing facility.

4.37. The average unit cost of UNICEF-built classrooms is BIF 28.3 million per classroom (2013)
equivalent to 19,197 US$/clrm or US $ 259 US$/m2 (without tax, value 2016$). This cost is an average
of the UNICEF program carried out from 2013 to 2015 in which UNICEF is contract management agency
(MOD). contracts out according to its own procedures. The program consists of 7 contracts for as many
schools, each of 9 classrooms giving a total of 63 classrooms. UNICEF also paid for services of
supervision/control of works, the cost of which is not available. Data are not available for the
management costs of UNICEF nor the overhead of the institutions.

4.38. UNICEF launched a consultation for the development of a "School Building Strategy" to guide its
support in Burundi. UNICEF considers that "lessons learned highlight the capactiy limits of UNICEF's
direct implementation of IEBs. The modalities of implementation such as delegated project management
(MOD) and the community approach with specialized technical assistance proves necessary ".17

Direct contract management by Communes (MOC) during the PSDEF

4.39. During the period of the PSDEF which starts in 2013, the FCE was the main donor of the
Communes for the implementation of the communal direct contract management approach
(MOC). At this time, as discussed above (para 4.10), three projects that had been initiated earlier and also
funding the MOC approach, will continue during PSEDF, namely: (i) the ADB-funded ECAP/PAPSE
project that started in 2009 and will end in 2013; (ii) the IDA-funded PTPGU that started in 2010 and
will be completed in 2014; and the Belgian-funded PADLPC project that started in 2012 and will be
completed in 2014.

4.40. During the PSDEF, 657 classrooms (and associated
                                                                                                Fig. 14. Location of MOC construction sites

the MOC approach in 219 schools belonging to 73
communes (out of 129) in 8 provinces (out of 18) under
MoE's overseeing through BISEM. According to the 2016
BISEM report, the FCE-finded MOC program of 2013 --of
BIF 5 billion (US$ 3.2 million)-- started in 57 sites in 3
provinces for a total of 198 classrooms. In 2014, with a
budget slightly over 18 billion BIF (US $ 11.6 million), the
MOC was extended to 5 other provinces. With these funds,
33 municipalities in the 8 provinces built 459 classrooms in
153 schools. The PSDEF's FCE-funded MOC program was
closely monitored by the Office of School Infrastructure,
Equipment and Maintenance (BISEM). The start-up was
slow: no classrooms were delivered in 2013. From 2014
onwards, municipalities were assisted by technical assistance
for contract management, named AMOCvii, provided by
NGOs (Gutwara Naz, Twitezimbere and PDO) and by the
PADLC project, to accompany them in the course of the                                        Source: Belgium Technical Cooperation, in BISEM

4.41. The standard plans for the classrooms are those of the Ministry of Education, therefore
identical to those of ABUTIP already mentioned, both for the classroom block and the latrines.

4.42. The unit cost of classrooms built by municipalities through the MOC approach on FCE
funds is on average BIF 19,12 million (without tax, value 2014) equivalent to 13,981 US$/clrm or
185 US$/m2 (without tax, value 2016$). The average cost was calculated on the basis of 25 works
contracts, a sample of one third of the total, and two contracts of services for technical
supervision/control. Note that, on this basis, the average cost of project management represents 13% of
the average cost of the works, which is a high ratio relative to other countries for the same service.

4.43. The quality of the work is average. The program has not been subject to an independent
technical audit; however, it was supervised by BISEM with funds from the BAS of the FCE. The final
BIDEM's supervision report was prepared with CTB's technical support. It finds that out of the 168 sites
visited (77% of the total), one quarter (44) have "imperfections to correct", the first cause of which is
attributed to the lack of close monitoring by the supervision firms (AMOC), and too low intensity of the
general supervision by the BISEM itself. The works on the construction sites were generally late and
some technical supervisors/controllers had sometimes abandoned the most delayed ones before the end of
the works. In general, the Communes did not correctly supervise the contracts of the site-
supervisor/controller, some of which were paid in full although their contract was not completed. An
independent technical audit covering all approaches (MOC and MOD, FCE and UNICEF, FONIC and
Communities) would be desirable to carry out a comparative assessment, based on the same analysis
criteria, to determine the relative technical performance of each program.

                         IV-D. The Performance-Based Financing (PBF) pilot project

4.44. The School's Performance-Based Financing (PBF) approach was piloted in Bubanza
Province in 2014-2016 in 81 schools out of the province's 225 schools in parallel to the PSDEF.
Although the approach was not conceptualized to finance buildings, but rather "soft" activities in
education, nevertheless, "hard" activities such as school buildings have been carried out by some
communities on PBF funds. However, this is in line with the approach, because it is fundamentally based
on community decisions about how best to use the funds to achieve the educational goals they set.
Although the PBF pilot took place during the PSDEF period, the school buildings or this pilot are not
considered part as a part of the PSDEF implementation, although they were carried out during the same
period. For this reason, they are not included in this study under chapter C dedicated to PSEDF and are
described in the present chapter D which is specific to them. However, they fully belong to the category
of constructions initiated and managed entirely by the communities, and they are similar to those
described in the previous chapter C1, paragraphs 4.17 and 4.18.

4.45. The PBF methodology for the Education pilot was inspired from a similar approach in the
health sector that stared ten years ago and achieved to be nationwide scale scaled up 4 years ago. On first
analysis, the pilot in the education sector seems to be a success, despite it is stopped since 2017 due to
external funding cessation. It has demonstrated the effectiveness of approaches based on the funding of
schools according to their results. In a simplified way, the approach works as follows: the school
community (teachers and parents) sets up an annual action plan with quarterly benchmarks to improve the
educational service offered by the school to pupils with quantified objectives of students' results. If the
quarterly objectives are met, the school receives funding that allows it to implement the actions of the
following quarter. The flexibility of the use of these funds is great. The observation is that the school
communities prioritize the financing of "good" inputs, in order to achieve the targeted results in terms of
student learning. Details of the analysis are given in Study 4 of this research. The question is whether
such an approach is "compatible" with a large program construction of school infrastructure.

4.46. Is the construction of classrooms an activity that could be part of an action plan part of this
performance based funding approach? The question necessarily arises insofar as: (a) financing a
construction is not a recurring expense, such as is the activities funded under a PBF annual action plan;
and (b) the cost of construction is much larger than that of educational activities typically financed in an
FBP action plan. The two FBP schools visited by the mission illustrate two ways of answering the
question posed above.
  Fig. 15. A small school in the RBF project           A small private school decided not to include
    pilot that did not include construction
                                               construction in its PBF action plan. The school is locate in the
                                               city-center and enrolls about 450 students in 9 classrooms, all in
                                               single grade per classroom. It does not have the ambition to
                                               grow and could not, anyway, because its cramped terrain is
                                               already full. Its infrastructure problem (unresolved) involves the
                                               construction of a fence-wall because, located right in the city
                                               center, the school is constantly crossed by passers-by. The PBF
                                               subsidies, amounting to BIF 5 million per year, are fully
                                               allocated by the Management Committee to "soft" quality
                                               improvement activities because, from its point of view, a fence
                                               wall is just far too high to be financed in the PBF.

        A medium-sized public school has included the construction of a classroom in its PBF action
plan. The school enrolls 1035 pupils. Each quarter, PBF subsidies are BIF 2.3 million. In 2016, the
Management Committee devoted most of these funds to the construction of a classroom that it chose as a
priority in its annual action plan. The project was spread over a school year financed by the PBF funds
plus a parents' contribution of 2000 BIF per pupil. The school met all the objectives of its action plan
(with priority given to the congestion of rooms) and fulfilled all the other quality criteria that trigger PBF

4.47. The inclusion of a building component in the continuation of the PBF program seems
possible and desirable. Minimal school infrastructure is required to offer good conditions for teaching
activities. From this perspective, the school's action plan should then have two distinct components: (1) a
section devoted exclusively to "soft" activities related to the quality of education; and (2) a component for
the "hard" activity exclusively devoted to construction. The addition of a classroom to relieve
overcrowding or to accommodate a certain year of education is not yet a prerequisite for the
implementation of these "soft" actions. However, it seems necessary that the "hard" part of the school
project should have its own processes and criteria.

4.48. In a PBF perspective, it would be desirable for a community-based construction program to
be organized on a modern method of community empowerment for construction, i.e.: acting as
delegated contract management authority on behalf of the Ministry of Education (see details in
below Chapter VI) . The existence in each school of Management Committees made up of
representatives of teachers and parents of pupils, organized for the implementation of their school project
is an important asset. In many other countries such as Benin, Togo, Côte d'Ivoire and Madagascar, their
school management committees are empowered to play the role of delegated contracting authority. This
empowerment includes: (i) the financial management of the funds for the construction project, (ii) the
procurement of works and furniture through local competition (Local Competitive Bidding - LCB) and
the competitive selection and contracting of a civil engineering technician for the technical supervision
and control of works on behalf of the Management Committee.

4.49. The inclusion of a construction component in the FBP program would benefit from the
strategic gradual expansion of this program. In such a context of gradual scale-up, the community
capacity-building program (the Management Committees) could be implemented in the same
geographical expansion scheme through a Grassroots Management Training program (see CSEEQ 4.3).

V. Comparative analysis of the unit costs of school buildings during the PSDEF
Box 7. Methodological note on unit cost calculation. The methodology aims to ensure good national and internatio-nal
comparability of unit costs. It includes 8 points. (1) Only the cost of the classrooms is considered and not that of the sanitary facilities
because the plan of the former is more standardized than this of the latter; and its cost is also less site specific than the second one
whose difficulty arises from realizing the underground pit that is highly dependent on geology; (2) Unit costs are actual costs as set
out in the contracts of the successful tenderers; (3) The unit cost of classrooms shall be calculated on the basis of the cost of the
classroom-block in the works contract, excluding the costs of the other works in the contract; (4) To neutralize the impact of
differences in classroom's area in different projects, the unit cost per m 2 is considered; (5) The "gross area" is considered, i.e.: the
thickness of the walls included - which is a standard for calculating costs in the construction industry; (6) In this calculation, the
surface of the porch is weighted by a coefficient of 50% because it is a covered-but-non-enclosed area - which is also an
international standard for calculating construction costs; (7) Current costs per m2 in local currency are converted to current US $ to
make them internationally comparable - for this purpose, the official annual exchange rate published by the World Bank is used; and
(8) Current US$ amounts are actualized to US$ of a reference year to offset the effect of differences in contract dates - inflation is
calculated from the deflator index of the US GNP published by the World Bank.

Burundi                                                                                    School Construction Study



5.1.      The outputs of the comparative analysis are the following (Fig 17):
      The community-based approach is the less
       expensive; but the quality of works is lower than
       this of MOD and MOC approaches.
      The MOC approach is more cost-effective than
       the MOD approach; and municipalities have been
       more cost-efficient with FONIC funds.
      The MOD approach is the less cost-effective; and
       ABUTIP is more cost-effficient than UNICEF;
       more-over if indirects costs would have been taken
       into account
The differences in the quality of works are not properly
assessed in the absence of any technical audit of the
works performed by all actors. This analysis should be
usefully complemented by a parallel comparative             Source: Authors' calculation
technical evaluation to compare qualities and costs.

5.2.     The quality of the construction is uneven and depends on the construction approach.
Burundi has a high-quality standard construction plan currently being implemented by the Ministry and
used by ABUTIP, FCE and FONIC. From the point of view of the quality of the work, it seems that the
first one is at the upper end of the spectrum, while the other two are of a lower quality due to the lack of
supervision/control by technical supervisors (FCE) or by the municipalities, as mentioned in the BISEM's
final report. The works by the communities is at the other end of the spectrum, with average poor quality
(provided the walls are made of fired bricks), and very poor quality and durability when the bricks are of
dried clay. Across the country, students are inequitably served in terms of the quality of their schools,
depending on whether they are lucky enough to be in a classroom built on external funding or in a
classroom built by their parents. It is desirable to find a solution to reduce this type of inequity. A
reflection to develop a strategy of school building that tackles this problem is desirable.


                                      VI. Options for the Future

Option 1. Delegation of contract management to empowered communities.

6.1. Community-based dynamics should continue to form the foundation of a national school
building strategy. In terms of basic education, the educational environment of the child is the family and
the school. We have seen in the past, and we still see in the present Burundi, the powerful involvement of
parents and communities in the development of the education system. The importance of which is well
understood at central and communal levels in Burundi, and actively supported by them. It may be in fact
that community and parental enthusiasm for the school is not unrelated to the willingness and ability of
students to achieve good results - as seen in the most recent international assessments – in spite of the
particularly difficult conditions in which they study. On this basis, it seems fair to imagine a future for the
Burundian educational system in which communities will continue to play a leading role in a modernized
framework, and in particular within the framework of educational decentralization.

6.2. Communal-level project management is a remarkable step forward, and the crucial role of
municipalities at the local level is now well established. Communal project management is key to
planning schools in line with other investments of communal level, in particular networks (water and
electricity), and compliance with environmental and social safeguards. In addition, communes play a


                                                      28
Burundi                                                                                                    School Construction Study



crucial role in identifying potentially usable land for the construction of schools and for securing the
administrative status of the selected land. Within the framework of the PSDEF, some communes have
successfully mastered the direct construction of school buildings, which gives them a good working
knowledge of this exercise.

6.3. Direct contract management by the communal authorities faces the usual constraints at this
level, in any decentralized system to the communal level, especially when, as in Burundi, communes
are composed up of numerous communities. Schools are not the only type of infrastructure which
competency has been transferred to communes by the decentralization law. Communes have the owner's
responsibility [maîtrise d'ouvrage] of all the projects included in their Communal Plans for Community
Development, the number of which will increase as the country develops and the increase in tax transfers
continues. Communes, whose capacities are structurally limited, will face increasing difficulty in
successfully meeting all their obligations as contracting authorities via the sole exercise of direct contract
management, i.e. the MOC as practiced so far. As long as they have few projects in their portfolio, MOC-
type processes can proceed without too much difficulty. However, the desirable shift to a larger scale -
and in particular to meet the immensity of the school building needs referred to earlier in part II - will be
structurally constrained by the limitation of the technical capacities of the communes.

6.4. Communes can solve these difficulties through the delegation of contract management to
communities for the construction of their schools. In such cases, the local communities act as delegated
contracting authority (MOD) on behalf of their commune. Evidence exists in many countries that local
communities can successfully play the role of MOD for the management of small-scale construction of
low complexity and cost - such as the construction of classrooms or school sanitation facilities. Such a
delegation of contract management is a direct implementation of the "principle of subsidiarity", which is
the regulatory principle of systems composed of several layers of responsibility (see box 8 below). When
the communes are the "owners" of schools [maîtres d'ouvrage], the delegation of contract management to
the concerned communities is not in any way an abandonment of their responsibility as Maîtres
d'ouvrage, but another way of organizing the exercise of this responsibility for greater efficiency. Their
own experience of direct contract management during the 2012-2016 phase of the PSDEF puts the
communes in a good foot to further oversee the delegation to the communities. Such arrangement is
currently successfully implemented in Africa in Benin and Tanzania (see Box 9). In Europe, of the 28
countries of the Union (2017), more than two thirds (19) delegate the construction of primary schools to
local communities, and in half of these countries (9) the communities receive this delegation from their
commune and the other from the region or the state. (See SCEEQ 1.6).

 Box 8. The principle of subsidiarity. This principle establishes that the local organization representing the interests of the
 grassroots community is best placed to take responsibility for the implementation of the construction project that concerns the
 community. Applied to the construction of schools, the principle establishes that the concerned school community of the village is
 in a position to be more effective than the State or its commune to implement its school construction project. When the country is
 decentralized and communes have transferred powers to build schools, if they adopt the principle of subsidiarity for the
 implementation of their Local Development Plan, this translates into the following two-pronged implementation arrangement: on
 the one hand, the commune would directly manage the implementation of a multi-community scale infrastructure which
 management, by nature, cannot be delegated; and, on the other hand, under the principle of subsidiarity, it is in the interest of the
 commune to delegate to the concerned communities the management of the implementation of community-scale constructions
 such as schools, for more effective implementation.


Box 9. Implementation by municipalities of the principle of subsidiarity in Benin. The decentralization in Benin dates back to
1999. The communes were then given competence for the construction of the primary schools: they are the projet management
authorities [maîtres d'ouvrage]. Since 2005, the municipalities are applying the principle of subsidiarity and, on this basis, they
delegate contract management to the communities concerned for the implementation of small basic infrastructures such as schools.
Communities are empowered to act as contract management agents [ maîtres d'ouvrage délégués] on behalf of their commune.
Since 2013 the FADeC, which is the national mechanism to channel public funds municipalities from the Ministry of Decentralization
(a mechanism similar to the FONIC), has been updated through the creation of a specific window from which the municipalities draw
the financial resources to finance the communities to which they delegate contract management for works. Since 2005 more than
5,000 classrooms have been built under this mechanism, twice as many as the Ministry of Education's projects have built during the




                                                                 29
Burundi                                                                                              School Construction Study



same period through MOD agencies, and has a cost 60% lower than that of agencies. The quality of the work is equivalent in both
approaches.


6.5.    Empowering communities to endorse the responsibility for contract management does not
mean abandoning the proper rules of contract management, nor the procurement proper rules.
When the communes delegate their project management to the concerned communities so that the latter
can carry out this task in their place, the communities must respect good practices, such as:
   (a) Good practices for project management: the contracting authority procures three contracts: one
       works contract, one furniture contract, and one contract for the services of technical
       supervision/control of works. Standard drawings and standard contracts used by communities are
       provided by the Ministry through the communes.
   (b) Good practices for procurement: (i) contracts for works and furniture must be procured through
       Local Competitive Bidding B) on the basis of simplified documents; (ii) service contract for the
       technical/supervision control is procured through competitive selection on the basis of a short list
       competition based on a long list of qualified technicians held by the Ministry and provided to the
       communes for their communities. Simplified procurement templates are established by the
       Ministry and guarantee full efficiency, economy and transparency.
As project managers, communes finance communities and oversee them in the execution of their MOD
mandates. They handover the works and register the new buildings in their patrimonial accounts; then
they take responsibility for their maintenance, still assisted by the communities for implementation.

6.6.     With this approach, the quality of the constructions carried out by the communities is likely
to be acceptably good, because on each site, the work of the construction contractor is individually
controlled by a qualified technician [maître d'oeuvre] recruited by each community. Payments for the
works by the community are made in installments (for foundation, walls, roofing and finishes) on the
basis of the certification of works well done by the maître d'oeuvre. The role of the communal technician
is then to ensure that the maîtres d'oeuvre do their job well. At the central level, the role of
BISEM/Ministry engineers is to oversee the technical quality of the work of the maîtres d'oeuvre
(including proposing sanctions where necessary).

6.7.     Construction costs could also be more economical with this approach. The comparative
analysis of the cost effectiveness of construction programs in Africa shows that decentralized approaches
(communes and communities combined) lead to average savings of 50% compared to centralized
approaches (Ministry or MOD agency) when the quality of the work is equivalent; and that delegated
approaches to project management by the communities (delegation from the Ministry or municipalities)
lead to an additional average saving of one third of the cost. (see ASCQE 5.1)

6.8.     Such an approach has two positive externalities: a) Local Competitive Biddings (LCP) offer
business opportunities to smaller local firms that are not always able to respond to National Competitive
Bidding (NCB); b) a large number of contract opportunities could also be offered to graduates of the civil
engineering courses in technical education - for the service of technical supervision/control of works on a
small building site. Experience in other countries has shown that there is a large number of technicians
trained in civil engineering on the market, but they occupy jobs outside their competences (for example,
as a taxi driver) because of lack of job opportunities offered by large construction or in engineering firms.
According to data collected by the mission, annually, more than 15 graduates with Bac-III qualifications
in Civil Engineering, 42 in Structures and Materials, and more than 10 3rd-degree graduates come onto
the job market.

6.9.   Finally, the exploration of this option is in line with the development of the third strategy of
constructions that is listed in the PSDEF text, as above-mentioned in chapter IVB, para. 4.12 and Box


                                                              30
Burundi                                                                              School Construction Study



2. In addition to the MOD and MOC approaches, the PSDEF is actually considering the exploration of a
strategy with grants to communities for the construction of their schools. The present option of a
delegation of contract management form on the project management delegated by communes to
communities, is in line with this perspective.

Option 2. Align communal financing channels

6.10. Another option could be to harmonize procedures at the communal level for financing
school buildings. Today, there are two channels: the FONIC and the (currently suspended) FCE. Were it
reinstated, the partners and the Government could initiate a reflection to harmonize the financing systems
of the communes and lead to the use of a single national funding mechanism. This would simplify
management at the communal level and allow for a better monitoring and evaluation system than the
current system.

6.11. This would require a revision of the FONIC's Procedures Manual so that it would be useable by
the donor partners who set up the FCE. On the occasion of such reflection, if the aforementioned
approach of delegation by the commune to the communities was envisaged - at least for a trial - this
modality could be considered within the framework of the creation of a specific window of the revised
FONIC. A modality of similar nature has been seen in Benin, in the FADeC fund (equivalent to the
FONIC) set up by the Ministry of Decentralization for the financing of Beninese municipalities for the
implementation of their Communal Development Plans.

Option 3. Incorporating a formal Construction Component into the Performance-based
Financing Approach (PBF)

6.12. As mentioned earlier (section IV), Burundi has just completed a pilot project on
Performance-Based Education (PBF) funding. The experience has proved successful and can form the
basis for a gradual transition to the national level, following the model of the Health sector, where the
PBF approach has now become the regular mode of operation. It has also been seen that it would be
preferable for construction activities to be dealt with in the PBF on their own specific terms. Indeed, the
financial scale of a building is too large for a construction activity to be treated in the same way as the
other education activities of much smaller scale. When this is the case, we saw that even a very small
construction siphons all PBF funding for a year.

6.13. The approach of empowering communities to build their own school - as described in
Option1 - fits perfectly into the dynamics observed in the PBF approach. These two approaches have
in common to place the school community at the heart of the decision-making and implementation
processes, in addition to making the community 100% accountable for the results of their activities. There
is little doubt that, if the two approaches were interrelated, the prospect of building may provide an
additional incentive for communities to improve their educational outcomes.

6.14. Specific funding mechanism. As part of this reflection, it would be advisable to explore with the
concerned actors the practical ways in which funding for the construction of school infrastructure -
coming from the commune or the Ministry - could be combined with PBF funding in order to achieve
synergy between the two and use construction funds as an additional lever for school communities to
further improve the educational performance of their children.

Option 4. Develop a National School Construction Strategy




                                                    31
Burundi                                                                              School Construction Study



6.15. It is desirable that the MEESRS develop a National Strategy for School Construction . The
strategy would take stock of the situation in 2017, provide a long-term vision, and specify steps to move
towards the materialization of that vision. To be useful, the development of a National Strategy should not
only be conceived as the production of a document, but rather as a process. The result would be better
achieved and the strategy better applied onwards if the process were to be partnership-based, including all
the actors involved around the Ministry: projects, agencies, municipal representatives, NGOs, CBOs,
institutions and TFPs, and where possible representatives of the communities, who contribute to the
implementation of school buildings. The exercise can provide an opportunity for further reflection on the
convergence of approaches and to consolidate what has already been achieved, and also to explore new
avenues for a rapid and economical transition for scaling-up. A first form of action could be to set up a
think-tank group, led by the Ministry, with experts from these organizations. The work of the UNICEF
office in Burundi, carried out as part of the development of its BCO's strategy for the construction and
equipment of basic infrastructure 2017-2018, would support the development by the MEESRS of its
national strategy, in particular the two studies that UNICEF will undertake in 2017, namely: (a) a national
diagnosis of the state of school construction, and (b) the development of a normative framework for
construction (norms and standards), especially regarding inclusion and school-friend-child aspects. For its
part, the World Bank could be available to contribute.

6.16. The MEESRS national strategy document for school construction could be structured
around the following themes:
      i. Assessment of school infrastructure, including land issues;
     ii. Availability of land and appropriation methodology for school-network extensions;
   iii. Assessment of the activities and projects that have contributed and are contributing to the
         production of the school facilities in the context of decentralization, with all approaches
         considered, whatever the project and the funding, and the modality of implementation, including
         community organization;
    iv. Analysis of the performance of different approaches in terms of production capacity, quality of
         work, and cost-effectiveness, and lessons learned from these analyzes;
     v. Mechanisms and tools (criteria) for the planning of new construction at community, communal
         and national levels;
    vi. Standards for school construction including inclusion (girls, children with disabilities) and the
         mitigation of environmental risks (floods, landslides, seismic risk);
   vii. Standard construction plans and standard procurement documents including aspects related to
         inclusion, and environmental and social risks;
  viii. Implementation strategy for buildings - roles and responsibilities of actors at the central,
         communal and community levels. Review of options in light of the implementation of the
         subsidiarity principle. What types of MOC projects? What types of projects should the
         municipalities delegate to an Agency specialized in MOD such as ABUTIP? What types of
         projects should the municipalities delegate to the concerned communities?
    ix. Costs of construction, mechanisms for the transfer of funds to municipalities, mechanism for
         funding communities by the municipalities, where appropriate;
     x. Mechanisms for managing funds at different levels (community-, commune- and central level),
         mechanisms and tools for reporting;
    xi. Mechanisms and tools for monitoring and evaluation of all operations that emerged during the
         Strategy period; evaluation of the Strategy at the end of its period of validity; proposal for
         revision for the following period; and mechanism for the adoption of the revision.

Current UNICEF studies cover some of these issues. A specific study is likely to be necessary to address
the issues of land availability and the solutions to the problems posed in this regard.

6.17. The approach to environmental and social safeguard measures. It would be desirable that this
issue should not be dealt with on a project-by-project basis but dealt with within a broader national school
management framework, depending on the need for expansion and upgrading of existing standards,
regardless of the project and its source of funding. A study on the preparation and adoption by the
Government of a national framework for environmental and social management of school building
projects could be carried out in parallel with the preparation of the Construction Strategy with its
conclusions integrated into the Strategy. Such a study would include a categorization of the types of risks
and a predetermined list of mitigation measures, as well as a simple "screening" mechanism of the
envisaged lands to determine the category to which they belong. Only potential lands which,
exceptionally, could not fall into anyone of the categories according to an exceptional specific risk, would
be subject of a specific environmental and/or social study.

6.18. The Disbursement-linked Indicator (DLI) Approach. This World Bank approach is available
since 2011. Among other things, it allows the financing of construction programs, insofar as the
infrastructure envisaged is neither complex nor of a large-size building. School building programs can be
funded through DLIs. This approach allows, under certain circumstances, an immediate first disbursement
based on a DLI obtained prior to project approval. Such first disbursement could be linked to the adoption
by the Government of a comprehensive construction strategy acceptable to the Bank, accompanied by a
manual of procedures detailing the implementation of the Strategy, with the environmental and social
management framework built in. This first disbursement allows the program to be launched, and the
following disbursements would be linked to outcome indicators measuring the progress of the program -
which must necessarily follow the provisions of the strategy and the procedural manual. No prior no-
objection from the Bank would be necessary as regards procurement. The Bank and the Government
would monitor the performance of the program's procurement system during the implementation of the
operation. If performance were found to be unsatisfactory, the government would be required to take
corrective action in a timely manner. In order to be considered, such an approach calls for: (a) strong
leadership; (b) a strategy and an enforcement manual for actors; and (c) a permanent and effective
monitoring mechanism by the government whose work may not be subject to unforeseen events and d) a
rigorous monitoring by the financial partner(s).

Option 5. Preparing a school construction program

6.19    Elements to consider for develop a small or medium-scale community-empowerment program for
school construction.

   a. Focus : Options are : early grades of primary schools (Cycle I and II of Fundamental), latest
grades of primary school (Cycle III of Fundamental) or middle school (Cycle IV of Fundamental). Late
entry, gross intake ratio and large class size, and large repetition rate in grade 1 as well as and high drop
out between grade 1 and 2, tend to justify focus on early gradesviii.

   b. Macro-planning/targeting : Options are : new schools vs. existing schools or preferably a
combination of both. For the creation of new schools, priorities may be given to areas where the distance
home-to-school is an obstacle to access and retention - the distribution of ratio of OOSC age 7-12 is a
possible targeting criteria (Fig. 18). For investment in existing schools, the targeting criteria may
combine 2 weighted criteria: (i) the ratio number of pupils per teaching/group (see average in Grade 1 in
Fig.18b), as quality education deteriorates when this ratio is over 40 pupils; and (ii) the number of sub-
standard/non-durable classrooms to be replaced.

    c. Implementation arrangement. As detailed in above-mentioned option 1, according to lessons
learned from experience in other countries, the potential most cost-effective implementation mechanism
is the Community-Empowerment approach within the Communal decentralization context. This approach
tend to generate savings compared to Local Governments' direct implementation, while ensuring good
quality works. All schools have a School Management Committee. They have already some sort of
experience in school construction under the "community works" organized by local authorities or through
their own initiatives. The PBF pilot has shown that they have the ability to manage a school project and
related funds, provided that they receive appropriate training and assistance. In a new vision for a more
efficient development, School Management Committees may be empowered by Communes through
specific Financial Agreements (grants) to manage funds and contracts for their school construction
project, on behalf of the communes.

   d. Micro-planning. Detailed criteria for the identification/selection of new land or the expansion of
the land of existing schools should be developed and agreed upon with the relevant authorities to ensure
that project-financed investment will be done on lands that have a cleared legal status as regards
ownership as well as social/environmental safeguards.
   e. Communities' capacity enhancement. Grassroots management training (GMT) may be provided
to targeted communities, using GMT modules and tools that can be developed on the basis of these
successfully used in other countries such as Togo. Benin and/or Madagascar. GMT training services may
be provided through partnerships with experienced NGOs such as Twitezimbere (that had past experience
with communities through BURSAP-I and II projects in 1995-2006 and recent experience with communes as
AMOC under FCE (2013-2016), Cordaid (experience in training communities under the PBF pilot), or other similar
NGOs.
   f. Communes' capacity enhancement. Communes may be trained to empower their communities,
delegate to them contract management, and adequately supervise them. Supervision capacity by
Communes implies regular supervision budget, monitoring protocols and reporting.
   g. Unit cost. In the perspective of contract management delegation from communes to communities,
the volume of works should be based on a "minimum package of infrastructure" limited to: (i) a 2-
classrom block with furniture and eventually comprising an office-storeroom area; (ii) 2 sanitation blocks
(one for boys and one for girls; (iii) water access and (iv) a green-fence. In this minimum package, the
supply of water should remain centrally managed through NCB because of the complexity of the
operations highly depending from local geologic conditions; while the rest should be delegated by
communes to communities and managed by the latter through LCBs. The total unit cost of such operation
includes direct and indirect costs.

Burundi                                                                               School Construction Study



      Direct costs are estimated on the basis of the maximum cost of a "classroom-equivalent". A
"classroom-equivalent" is composed of the classroom itself, its furniture and the ratio per classroom of an
office-storeroom, sanitation blocks, water point and green-fence. The estimation is a maximum-cost,
based on the actual costs of FONIC, of US$ 9,815 and US$ 11,740 per classroom excluding and
including taxes respectively -- corresponding to the unit costs of 126 and 149 US$/m2 in 2016$, as above-
mentioned on Table 10 of paragraph 4.24. Indeed, one may also assume that the delegation form
communes to communities may generate in Burundi the 25% cost-saving observed in other countries (see
ASCQE 5.1). However, to be prudent, the present initial estimate is rather based on a "conservative"
assumption, i.e. the FONIC costs. In addition to the unit cost of the classroom, the estimation adds the
cost of furniture, and the ratio per classroom of the costs of the office-storeroom, the sanitation, water
point and green-fence. The total of direct costs may be estimated to US$18,600 and 22,200 per
"classroom-equivalent", respectively excluding and including taxes.
      Indirect costs include : (i) technical supervision/control of the works by a competent technician
competitively hired by the community (max 10% of the direct cost of works) and by a specialist in water
point implementation; (i) provision of grassroots management training - GMT (estimated 7% of the direct
cost of works on the basis of international experience), (iii) management costs incurred by the
community, and (iv) the supervision costs by communes and by BISEM respectively 2% of the direct
costs of works). Above-mentioned percentages are purely indicative and should be adjusted after
discussion with the Ministry.
      As a whole unit cost of the full package (direct and indirect costs) is estimated to be under a
maximum of US$22,000 and US$26,140 per classroom-equivalent, respectively without and with taxes,
and actualized to the anticipated inflation during the period of a future project. Details of the estimation
are in Annex 1.
   h. Flow of funds. Funds may be channeled from the center to communes through FONIC under a
specific arrangement within its own operation manual. Then from Communes to communities through
contractual Financial Agreements as detailed in the Operation Manual.
   i. Management and supervision by Ministry/BISEM. Capacity enhancement should be provided to
the BISEM to carry out the organization, coordination and supervision of the overall program
implemented by the various actors. The BISEM would be responsible to develop and permanently update
a Monitoring system and to have periodic evaluations carried out by independent expertise (technical
audits, beneficiary assessments, score cards, etc.
   j. Implementation procedures manual (IPM). A Manual detailing roles and responsibilities of the
various actors, and provided a complete tool-box of standards documents for procurement, plans, contract
and financial management would be necessary.


                           VII. Two environmental and social issues

Seismic risk

7.1.    Seismic risk in Burundi is significant in the western part of the country. The country is on the
western rift valley line, which has experienced numerous earthquakes of great magnitude (see Figure
18a). The epicenter of the violent earthquake of September 22, 1960, which caused considerable damage,
was on this line, very close to Bujumbura. The National Risk Prevention Strategy document indicates that
seismic hazards are high in the western strip of the country, along the borders with DRC and Rwanda, and
on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. (Figure 18b). The same area is also exposed to the greatest risk of
landslides (Fig.18c). Some points in this zone also include the risk of heavy floods, notably the
Bujumbura region and the coastal areas of the southern provinces of Bururi and Makamba. The

Government's Priority and Strategic Action Plan for 2012-2015 includes awareness-raising on the
protection of public amenities and infrastructures, in particular schools [...] against disaster risks.

7.2.    Reducing the vulnerability of school buildings to natural hazards. The standardized building
plan for classrooms is well designed to deal with seismic risk. It includes two chain joints (top and
bottom) and reinforced concrete structure stiffeners as recommended by the EMI-EA guidelines based in
Kampala. However, alongside the constructions that follow this model (FCE, FONIC, ABUTIP and
UNICEF), most of the construction done by communities do not have these structural reinforcements and
are therefore highly vulnerable to seismic risk as well as landslides/soil compaction risks. In addition, it
should be noted that mitigation of seismic risk is not achieved only by good building structure. It also
requires that arrangements be made for the location of buildings on the ground (for example, a sufficient
distance from slopes). Field visits indicate that these measures are often not respected. The location of
school buildings also plays a crucial role in reducing the vulnerability of schools to the risk of flooding.
Finally, due to the increase in population densities and the concomitant scarcity of available land, the
need for vertical expansion of schools will quickly arise. Multistoried buildings must respect several
additional rules to be para-seismic. For all the above reasons, it appears necessary that the Ministry
develops a small construction guide that summarizes the key points to respect for the establishment and
construction of schools so that they are not vulnerable to the risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes,
landslides and floods. This guide is intended for communes and communities. The development of such a
guide could be part of the development of the school building strategy mentioned above.

The use of fired brick

7.3.     The continued use of fired brick in school constructions poses an environmental problem.
Because of its landlocked situation, imported building materials arrive in Burundi at a high price. A visit
across provinces shows that cement-based materials are rare and sparingly used, never for the production
of blocks of walls where, instead, handcrafted wood-fired bricks are used, raising the question of wood as
combustible, which directly contributes to the overexploitation of trees. The MEESRS’ experience in
stabilized soil bricks (SSB, in French briques de terre stabilisée -- BTS) as an alternative to fired brick is
inconclusive. This is in line with international experience. As in other countries facing the same problem,

it is likely that the alternative is the cement block. In any case, the study on the National Strategy for
School Buildings will have to address this issue to outline possible solutions.

I.      Executive Summary

            A. Capital Markets
     1.      Argentina’s improved sovereign credit rating has helped to spur the recent sub-
     sovereign and corporate bond issues. In early April 2016, Standard & Poor’s upgraded
     Argentina’s sovereign ratings for local and foreign currency debt to B from B-. This follows the
     ratings upgrade from Moody’s which raised Argentina’s sovereign rating for foreign currency
     denominated debt from C1 to B3 in 2016. This rating was re-affirmed by Moody’s in March
     2017. Since Argentina’s re-entry into the international capital markets in early 2016, there has
     been USD 8.4 billion and USD 4.4 billion of bonds issued by sub-sovereign and corporate
     entities which is being used, in part, being used to support infrastructure projects. Although
     investor appetite has been relatively strong, it is difficult to ascertain the level of liquidity for
     sub-sovereign debt over the long-term.
     2.      The potential level of involvement of foreign and local banks in the financing of
     infrastructure is still to be determined once Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) projects are
     tendered. Going forward, the issues that will impact the participation of lenders are: (i) the
     timing for completing and implementing the underlying regulatory framework for PPPs; (ii) the
     development of a project pipeline and subsequent tenders; (ii) macroeconomic conditions. The
     ability of the renewable energy projects under the RenovAR program to obtain bank financing
     will serve as useful benchmark for the rest of the PPP program.
     3.       Lenders have been relatively inactive in the financing of infrastructure. Generally,
     lenders tend to be heavily involved in the financing of infrastructure due to their relative ability
     to provide long-term debt financing and to develop financial structures that can sculpt the
     amount of interest paid during project construction. The absence of active PPP projects that have
     been tendered and reached commercial close has effectively precluded the participation of
     lenders. Going forward, the issues that will impact the participation of lenders are: (i) the timing
     of the drafting and implementation of the underlying regulatory and policy framework for PPPs;
     (ii) the development of a project pipeline and tender schedule; and (iii) macroeconomic
     conditions. Additionally, the lack of long-term hedging instruments makes it more difficult to
     attract foreign based banks.

     4.       Despite recent reforms, financing of infrastructure from institutional investors faces
     several challenges. In contrast with other countries in the region, Argentina lacks an
     institutional investor base with sufficient Assets Under Management (AUM) to anchor
     infrastructure financing. Thus, in the short to medium term, any financing via the capital markets
     would likely require the participation of foreign-based institutional investors. The value of the
     mutual fund and insurance industries are relatively small in relation to the overall size of its
     economy and compared to other countries in the LAC region. Additionally, the private pension
     fund system needs to be restarted due to the nationalization of the pension system by the
     previous government administration. Another potential source for financing of infrastructure is
     the Sustainable Guarantee Fund (FGS) which is being managed by the National Social Security
     Administration (ANSES). For the FGS to be more closely aligned with market demand, the
     Government of Argentina (GoA) should review the governance structure, mission, and
     investment strategy of the FGS as a means for crowding in investment in infrastructure.


                                                      5
5.      Despite the recent bond issues by sub-sovereign entities, indebtedness levels
currently appear to be manageable. For example, the Province of Cordoba raised debt levels
from 35 percent to 40 percent of revenues. However, Moody’s expects that downward pressures
on its credit rating would be considered if the Provinces’ debt levels were to reach at least 50
percent of revenues. Cordoba’s operating margin averaged 11.7 percent from 2011-15 despite
high inflation and the devaluation of the ARG peso.1
6.       A key element for determining the long-term sustainability of Argentina’s re-entry
into the international capital markets is not only timely repayment, but also how the bond
proceeds are used. Although sub-sovereign and corporate entities have obtained debt through
the international capital markets, the success and sustainability of these initiatives as an
aggregate is contingent on the extent that bond proceeds are used to invest in infrastructure. An
initial survey seems to show that non-sovereign debt has been used for financial support, such as
the refinancing outstanding debt and to close budget gaps, as well as for economic development
purposes. For example, there is anecdotal evidence that the Province of Argentina is using its
large debt program for both purposes. To encourage project finance transactions, the continued
use and expansion of capital market instruments should go in parallel with the development
normative framework for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)
7.      Although the proposed Capital Markets Law is intended to reduce market
inefficiencies, additional legislation is needed to deepen local capital markets. This law,
which is under legislative review, may not go far enough to develop the institutional base needed
to provide long-term financing for infrastructure. Additional provisions could be added or new
legislation could be developed that would: (i) encourage insurance companies to offer new types
of products; (ii) rebuild private pension by incentivizing the establishment of asset management
companies for managing pension assets; (iii) providing preferential tax treatment for closed end
mutual funds (e.g. Colombia) or value capture adjacent to real estate (e.g. Colombia and the
United States); (iv) encouraging the establishment of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs); (vi)
encourage the development of long-term hedging instruments to manage currency risk; and (vii)
incentivize the issuance of local currency bonds and project bonds.

8.      The cash flow profile for financing infrastructure, typically involves a large capital
outflow during construction, followed by initial revenue generation and debt service over
time. This is known anecdotally as the “J-curve.? Consequently, infrastructure assets typically
require long-term debt financing to generate sufficient cash flows to repay interest and principal
and to generate a sufficient return on equity, if applicable. To provide lenders with greater
certainty that project cash flows are sufficient over time to cover debt payments, it is necessary
that systemic risks can be controlled sufficiently so that the private sector can then price,
manage, and mitigate project and non-project specific risks. The latter includes the following: (i)
macroeconomic risks (ii) banking sector risks; (iii) public sector risks; corporate sector risks; (iv)
market and liquidity risks.

9.     The main risks limiting investment are macroeconomic risks, particularly inflation
pressures and the foreign exchange risk, followed by policy uncertainty. Macroeconomic
conditions and developments, especially high inflation and high nominal interest rates, explain
the limited ability to form a yield curve, the absence of domestic long-term finance, the

preferences for issuing securities in dollars or other foreign currency, and difficulties in obtaining
long-term maturities in local currency denominated debt. Thus, foreign lenders and investors
continue to be missing from the domestic capital markets. This applies to equity, fixed income,
and non-listed direct investment. It is expected that inflation will be brought down to levels to
more manageable levels in 2017; but reaching single digit inflation is as a medium-term goal.
The IMF’s most recent forecast published in April 2017 estimated that consumer prices would
increase by 25.6 percent and 18.7 percent in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Recent progress has
been made with the issuance of Peso-linked notes by Argentine corporate entities.

10.     There are also several procedural and regulatory barriers that will continue to be a
deterrent for foreign investors, even as the macroeconomic and policy environment
improves. Such barriers include onerous account opening, know your client, and tax registration
procedures and requirements. On the financing side, where infrastructure projects have USD
earnings, a dollar market is likely to develop. However, financing for peso earning projects
remains an open question. Another important issue is ensuring that the Comisión Nacional de
Valores (CNV) becomes a credible and effective supervisor, particularly as the market increases
in size and complexity. Steps have already been taken in this direction, with the appointment of a
new board, which has embarked on a wholesale review of the organization as well as some of the
proposed reforms included in the draft Capital Market Law. The development of a pipeline of
bankable PPP projects is also critical.

11.     Although the enactment of the proposed Capital Markets Law is intended to reduce
market inefficiencies, additional legislation, regulation and policies are needed to deepen
and widen local capital markets. This law, which is still under legislative review, may not go
far enough to develop the institutional investor base needed to provide long-term financing for
infrastructure. Provisions could be added or new legislation could be developed which would: (i)
encourage insurance companies to offer new types of products; (ii) rebuild private pension
systems by incentivizing the establishment of asset management companies; (iii) providing
preferential tax treatment for closed end mutual funds or value capture adjacent to real estate;
(iv) supporting the establishment of REITs; (v) reviewing the governance structure, mission, and
investment strategy of the FGS; (vi) support the development of long-term hedging instruments
to manage currency risk through trusts or related mechanisms; and (viii) promote the issuance of
peso-linked bonds while developing a peso/dollar hedge market.

       B. Infrastructure Finance
12.     Total infrastructure needs are estimated to be approximately USD 155 billion. This
amount includes the ongoing RenovAR program as well as proposed transport and water
projects. Given the status of the PPP program and the financial feasibility of the proposed
infrastructure projects and the depth of the capital markets, it is realistic that approximately 10 to
20 percent of this amount can be delivered as a PPP.

13.     The FODER model for renewable energy could potentially be replicated. The GoA
has allocated ARS 12 billion (USD 860 million) at current exchange rates) to the Fund for the
Development of Renewable Energy (Fondo para el Desarrollo de Energías Renovables,
FODER). FODER is divided into two accounts—the project finance account and a payment
guarantee account. The latter will be used to guarantee payments for electricity under all PPAs
tendered through the RenovAR program. This account must always have on deposit at least 12
months of payments due by the offtaker, the wholesale Energy Market Administrator (Compañía
Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico Sociedad Anónima, CAMMESA) If at any
point FODER does not have enough funds, the Ministry of Finance is obligated to replenish the
account. The RenovAR program has been backstopped by a USD 480 million World Bank
guarantee facility to the private investors to honor any PPA offtaker payment commitments or
other government payment obligations specified. These arrangements and enhancements have
been helpful to attract private investment into the renewable energy sector. RenovAR Round 1
and Round 1.5 were oversubscribed.
        C. Public Private Partnerships
14.      The enactment of the PPP Law in 2016 and the development of initial regulation in
support of this law are first positive steps. However, the new PPP law did not define the
institutional framework for development of the underlying regulatory framework as well as the
responsibilities and institutional location of the PPP unit. After some uncertainty and reshuffling,
the PPP unit, now resides within the Ministry of Finance. Additional legislation and/or regulation
is needed to better define: (i) how the project pipeline is managed and developed; (ii) contract
renegotiations; (ii) arbitration procedures; (iii) environmental reviews; (iv) feasibility studies (v)
Congressional notification; and (vi) how to treat unsolicited proposals.
15.    The PPP project pipeline is still evolving with potential projects in renewable
energy, transport, water, and irrigation. The RenovAR program managed by the Ministry of
Energy and Mines has successfully concluded two separate auction rounds resulting in the
awarded of 37 projects that will generate an estimated 1,167 MW of wind energy and 918 MW
of in solar energy upon completion. The projects have 20-year project purchase agreements
(PPAs) with CAMMESA. Additionally, an estimated 10-12 projects are being evaluated in the
                                                    8
transport sector and 4-8 pilot projects. The timing for tendering these projects will depend on the
robustness of the feasibility studies, the development and implementation of the normative
framework for PPPs, and the establishment of a process for evaluating, selecting, prioritizing
projects. Market sounding activities should be conducted once bankable projects have been
identified for tender.

16.     The absence of a formal PPP project pipeline in Argentina has been raised by
potential market participants as being a potential impediment to investment. The project
pipeline and tender schedule are important market signal for lenders and investors to mobilize
scarce financial and human resources.

17.     Market barriers may also play a role in the timing and level of interest of foreign
investors in PPP. The Odebrecht bribery scandal has not only impacted the political situation
and PPP program in Brazil, but throughout the region. The reverberations of this scandal include
the cancellation of billion dollar projects in Colombia and Peru that had been previously awarded
to Odebrecht. Although the Odebrecht situation may discourage some sponsors and lenders from
investing in the region, others may see this a potentially propitious opportunity to enter the
market.
        D. Strategies for Supporting Capital Market Financing of Infrastructure
18.      Future support for the financing of infrastructure should build on existing
initiatives and programs. Potential support with respect to capital market financing of
infrastructure, PPPs, and project finance transactions could involve the following areas: (i)
expanding the types and durations of capital markets instruments that can be used to finance
infrastructure; (ii) replicating the FODER model to support a general infrastructure fund; and
(iii) technical assistance for the PPP program. With respect to expanding and deepening capital
markets, the following technical assistance activities should be considered:
   i.   encourage insurance companies to offer new types of products;
  ii.   rebuild the private systems by incentivizing the establishment of asset management
        companies for managing pension assets;
 iii.   provide preferential tax treatment for closed-end mutual funds (e.g. Colombia) or value
        capture adjacent to real estate (e.g. Colombia and the United States);
 iv.    support the establishment of REITs;
  v.    review the governance structure, mission, and investment strategy of the FGS;
 vi.    encourage the development of long-term hedging instruments to manage currency risk;
vii.    incentivize the issuance of local currency bonds and project bonds while developing a
        peso/dollar hedge market.
viii.   Technical advice should be considered to support the development of special purpose
        trusts, such as FODER, to provide financial support and credit risk enhancements in case
        PPP projects experience temporary financial pressures.
 ix.    examine “value capture? strategies based on increasing tax revenues from land adjacent
        to infrastructure assets, as complementary financing sources;
                                                9
 x.    analyze how sector-based funds with dedicated tax revenues (e.g.: gas taxes, for road
       financing) can be used as collateral to secure bond issues.
 xi.   enhance the private placement (144(k)) style regime to better incorporate project bonds
       for sale to qualified investors.
19.      Options should be explored for modifying or expanding partial credit guarantee
facilities to include other infrastructure sectors or support sub-sovereign entities in their
respective PPP programs. This can include: (i) contingent credit lines as stand-by liquidity
and/or credit enhancement facilities; (ii) first loss partial credit guarantees; (iii) first loss
“contract payment? guarantees; (iv) financial intermediaries to insure or guarantee infrastructure
bonds; (v) contingent credit lines as a guarantee backstop facility; (vi) stand-alone infrastructure
fund; and (vii) the securitization of government availability payments as bond collateral.
20.     Additionally, technical assistance can be provided to support the PPP program. This
can include support to improve the institutional capacity of the PPP unit, recommend changes to
the normative framework, support the implementation of the regulatory framework, project
selection and prioritization, and market sounding activities.

II.      Background

      21.     Despite having the 21st largest economy globally, Argentina lags compared to other
      large economies in the region and globally. Argentina was ranked 85th among 138 countries in
      infrastructure development, per the Global Competitiveness Index 2016-2017 report from the
      World Economic Forum. This ranking is well behind most of Argentina’s neighboring countries,
      such as Chile (44th), Uruguay (47th), Mexico (57th), and Brazil (72nd).

      22.     In recent years, Argentina has steadily increased spending on infrastructure from
      7.8 billion in 2008 to 12.0 billion in 2013. Public spending has ranged from 66 percent to 74
      percent of total investment in infrastructure, except in 2010 during which public spending on
      infrastructure reached 80 percent. Total investment in infrastructure has averaged 1.9 percent of
      GDP. However, compared to other relatively large economies in the region, total investment in
      infrastructure has averaged 3.2 percent of GDP, with only Mexico (1.6 percent of GDP) having
      invested less into infrastructure during this period.
      23.     To address the infrastructure deficit, the Ministry of Transport announced an
      ambitious 3-year USD 83 billion investment program which includes an estimated 20 to 25
      percent of private capital to be completed by 2019. The infrastructure plan includes the
      doubling of size of the national highway network, the upgrades of existing airports and ports, and
      the construction and expansion of the rail network, including cargo lines. Furthermore, the
      Ministry of Energy Ministry has launched a USD 36 billion power generation program with the
      aim of increasing the country’s power generation by about 20 gigawatts (GW) by 2025.
      24.     The value of loans to the private sector has been growing steadily since 2008 due to a
      combination of growth and inflation. As shown in Figure 2, total lending to the private sector
      increased from ARG 130 billion in 2008 to 1,128 billion in 2017 year-to-date (YTD),
      representing an average annual increase of approximately 30 percent. Due the lack of available
      information as to the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), it is difficult to
      differentiate how much of this growth has been organic growth in the sector and how much is
      due to inflation. The average annual increase in the Wholesale Price Index (drawn from the

World Development Indicators) is estimated at approximately 15 percent 2, which indicates that it
is likely that the increased value of loans is likely due to both factors.

25.    The local reference lending rate in Argentina has increased steadily but appears to
have stabilized during 2016. The Buenos Aires Large Amounts Deposits Reference Rate
(BADLAR) for lending was 10.00 percent at the end of 2009 increasing as high as 27.25 percent
by the end of 2015 (Figure 2). The BADLAR rate was 19.875 on December 30, 2016 and
19.135 as of April 19th, 2017. Stabilization of the reference lending is a positive sign for future
lending activities, especially in the infrastructure sector which has long-term investment
horizons.
26.    The banking sector remains relatively stable and healthy with available capacity to
provide financing for infrastructure. Regulatory capital to risk weighted assets was 14.4
percent having increased 13.4 percent during 2014. This percentage exceeds the Basel III
requirements of 10.5 percent by (required by 2018). Additionally, the number of non-performing
loans (NPLs) has decreased gradually from a high of 5.20 percent in 2005 to 1.74 in 2015. 2016
data was not available as of this writing.

the previous ten years.

28.     Syndicated bank loans in Latin America have decreased substantially during the
last ten years but may rebound in the future. Syndicated loans are common for the debt
financing of larger projects, particularly infrastructure project finance transactions, as this
structure allows for greater risk diversification among a group of banks. Moreover, loan
syndicates and club deals concentrates creditors as opposed to diffuse bond holders, so that debt
restructuring can be cheaper and quicker compared to bond financing.3 However, the loan
syndication market in Latin America has decreased steadily since 2007 despite a strong pike in
2013. During 2016, total syndicated loan volume decreased 23.16 percent from the previous year
to USD 35.4 billion on 115 transactions. Telecommunication, industrials, and energy accounted
for 24 percent, 20 percent, and 8 percent of total syndicated loans, respectively.4 In terms of
financing structure, project finance deals have historically accounted for 3 to 4 percent of the
total value of syndicated loans in the Americas regions, which includes U.S. and Canada.

A.         Capital Market Financing of Infrastructure
29.     A new Capital Markets Law is under consideration by the Congress . The proposed
legislation would change the roles and responsibilities of the Comisión Nacional de Valores
(CNV) and seek to eliminate several barriers that limit capital market activities that were
imposed during previous administrations. Key changes included in the proposed law, some of
which would support infrastructure finance, are summarized below:
(i)        CNV would regulate and require the audit of “investment managers? defined as entities
           providing regular financial advice. This provision is intended to encourage the return of
           private banking activity.5
(ii)       The new law would limit the ability of CNV to designate “supervisors? with veto power
           over resolutions adopted by the Boards of Directors of publicly traded companies.
           However, CNV would be able to initiate administrative proceedings and impose
           sanctions in the event of violations of the capital market law.
(iii)      Change the sources of funding for CNV from fines, to fees from the public offering of
           securities, the registration of agents, clearing houses, and firms offering derivatives.
(iv)       Modifies the regulation regarding pre-emptive rights for public equity offerings.
(v)        Allows CNV to issue rules governing private placements, including prospectus
           publication, the number and type of qualified investors who can purchase shares, and
           places limits on share distribution.
(vi)       Modifies the regulatory framework for voluntary and involuntary takeover bids. The
           objectives are to protect potential investors by better defining “fair market value? for
           hostile takeovers, and outlines the procedures for delisting, if a firm becomes private.
(vii)      Increases the regulatory powers of the CNV with respect to external auditors. This
           includes the establishment of a registry for external auditors, the development of a system
           for supervision, information requests, and inspections, and the imposition by CNV of
           penalties and fines for non-compliance.
(viii) Amends Law #24083 governing mutual funds. In particular, the proposed legislation
       would (1) more clearly define open and closed mutual funds, (2) modify the tax treatment
       with respect to closed mutual funds, so that there are fewer disincentives for investing in
       these instruments, (3) require prospectuses for closed funds, but not for open mutual
       funds, (4) increase the regulatory powers and supervisory responsibility of CNV over the
       management companies of mutual funds, and (5) establish new guidelines for the
       settlement of open mutual funds and shareholder meetings for closed mutual funds
(ix)       Modernizes the legal and regulatory framework for negotiable obligations, including the
           change in notification requirements as well as introduces exemptions on stabilization and
           readjustment clauses for currency convertibility. Payments in local currency under
           section 765 of the Civil and Commercial code will no longer be applicable. This
           provision may impact the financing of real estate and infrastructure projects.

    Private banking refers to investment or other financial services provided to high net worth investors.

                                                            15
(x)    Although the proposed legislation is relatively silent with respect to syndicated loans, it
       would allow, if enacted, the establishment of mortgage and pledged collateral through a
       collateral agent who would work for the benefit of creditors. Secured collateral can be
       transferred to a third party.
30.      Although many of the proposed reforms in the capital markets law cover CNV’s
operational and regulatory responsibilities, the law contains provisions which could
indirectly impact infrastructure finance. The final version of the proposed law could include
the following provisions: (i) encourage improved transparency and reporting of banks and non-
financial institutions; (ii) encourage increased participation from institutional investors, such as
mutual funds; and (iii) clarify the framework for long-term hedging instruments. Future
legislation could examine potential incentives for the sale and purchase of local currency
denominated bonds issued for infrastructure projects, such as preferential tax treatment for
institutional investors and fideicomiso trust structures with a facility backstop to better manage
currency risk.
31.     Although the banking sector appears to have sufficient capacity to offer loans, there
have been almost no loans for infrastructure projects. This differs markedly from other
countries in the region and globally which rely heavily on bank loans to finance infrastructure.
Key limiting factors include the challenging macroeconomic conditions, the evolving policy
environment, the time lag for banks to set up local operations to conduct due diligence, and the
short- to medium-term timeframe until potentially bankable projects are tendered and awarded.
This situation is expected to change once new projects, e.g. in the renewable energy sector or in
transport, are ready to seek financing to begin construction.
32.     Despite recent issuance bond issuances in the international capital markets, the
amount of outstanding debt by Argentine corporate and provincial governments remains
relatively small. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) estimates that corporate and
government entities in Argentina had an estimated USD 206 billion in outstanding debt issues
listed internationally and another USD 37 billion listed locally as of the 3rd quarter of 2016.
Approximately 55 percent of the internationally listed debt was issued by government entities,
including state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as well as provincial and municipal governments. The
outstanding amount of debt issued is expected to increase due to the recent debt issuances by
provincial governments. However, total outstanding debt issuance by private and public entities
based in Argentina is relatively small compared to some countries in the LAC region as well as
other emerging market economies with active PPP programs. For example, Malaysia has issued
an estimated USD 349 billion in debt with approximately 45 percent listed in the domestic
capital market (Table 2).

33.     In recent months, there has been relatively strong activity and interest in corporate
and sub-sovereign government bonds in Argentina. The issuance of these bonds is tied
closely with the market perception of the sovereign credit rating along with the underlying credit
quality of the bond issuer. Bonds issued in the past year are full recourse having been
backstopped by the revenues and assets of the issuer. While most of the bonds have been
denominated in foreign currency, there have been a few bonds issued by sub-sovereign
governments in local currency. As of this writing, there have no project bonds issued that are
fully secured using project revenues and assets.

B.      Corporate Bonds
34.     Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, there have been seven
internationally placed corporate bond issues which raised USD 4.4 billion between the
second half of 2016 and in early 2017. The foreign currency denominated corporate bond
issues were from companies in the electricity generation, transportation, and water sectors.
Interest rates have ranged from 6.95 percent to 8.75 percent and maturities have ranged from
three to ten years. The corporate bond issues have involved international placement and
denominated in foreign currencies. Three additional corporate bond issues have been planned
that would raise a total USD 600 million. Bonds issued by locally based infrastructure and
related companies is summarized in Table 3.

        i.       Electricity Generation and Distribution
35.    AES Argentina Generación (AES) which operates more than 3.5GW of capacity in
Argentina or about 12 percent of installed capacity, placed a USD 300 million 144A/Reg. S
bond. AES generation capacity includes approximately two-thirds thermal and one-third
hydroelectric power. The nine generation facilities are in the provinces of Buenos Aires,
Neuquén, Salta y San Juan. AES, one of the largest private power generation companies in the
country, has placed a USD 300 million Rule 144A/Reg S offering. The bond has a coupon of
7.750 percent and are due in 2024. Credit Suisse Securities, Itau BBA and JP Morgan were joint
book-running managers for the transaction.
36.    Pampa Energy issued a USD 750 million bond in January 2017 with a 7.625 percent
yield and a 10-year maturity. Pampa Energy has ownership stakes in Petrobras Argentina and
the electricity distribution company Edenor, the electricity transmission company Transener.
Through these acquisitions, Pampa Energy has become the largest electricity company in
Argentina. Petrobras Argentina had issued a USD 500 million bond issue in July 2016.
37.    In late 2016, Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) issued a USD 1 billion bond
with an 8.5 percent coupon and a 5-year maturity. Demand was relatively strong, especially
considering that the market only had one day to react to YPF’s bond issue.
38.    Genneia which is currently developing renewable energy generation facilities,
placed a USD 350 million that was 3 times oversubscribed. The bond had a coupon of 8.75


                                                        18
percent and a six-year maturity due in 2022. The bond was placed internationally and traded
locally. Proceeds from the bond issue will be used to finance wind generation projects.
39.    Stoneway Capital Corporation issued a $500 million Rule 144A/Regulation S
project bond in February 2017. The transaction provides financing for the development,
procurement, construction and operation of four simple-cycle power generating plants totaling
686.5 MW in the Buenos Aires region
40.     CAPEX, the Argentine electricity company, completed a USD 300 million bond sale
in May 2017. CAPEX operates 672 MW thermos-combined cycle generation facility which is
connected to the grid through a 111-km transmission line, operates a liquefied natural gas (LNG)
facility in Neuquén, and is involved in the production and sale of oil and natural gas.
Approximately USD of these proceeds will be used to pay off existing debt that is due in 2018.
41.    Central Puerto, S.A. (CEPU) is preparing a bond issue of up to USD 500 million .
Central Puerto, S.A (CEPU) is an energy generation company that privatized in 1992 with an
estimated total generation capacity of 2,165 MW or approximately 9 percent of total generation
capacity in Argentina. CEPU’s electricity generation facilities are in Buenos Aires and Neuquén.
The planned bond issue that was originally planned for early 2017 has been delayed due to
market uncertainty. The bonds would have a maturity ranging from 7 to 10 years. JP Morgan and
Deutsche Bank are the underwriters.
42.    Grupo Albanesi, which operates thermal, solar, and natural gas that generates
nearly 1,000 MW, is planning to issue a USD 100 million bond. The planned bond issue
would have a coupon of 9.623 percent and 6-year maturity.
        ii.       Transport
43.     Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 (AA2000) issued USD 400 million in bonds with a 10-
year maturity which were oversubscribed by a factor of 9. Aeropuertos Argentina 2000
(AA2000) is a consortium consisting of locally based Corporación America (75.65 percent), the
SEA Group, which operates the Milan Airport (8.5 percent), RIVA S.A. (0.85 percent), and the
Government of Argentina (15 percent). In 1998, AA2000 was awarded a 30-year concession for
33 airports, including Ezeiza and Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires. The concession
contract includes an option to extend the concession for an additional 10-years. Moody’s
assigned a B2 rating to AA2000’s internationally placed bond with a stable outlook. The rating
reflected the airport operator’s strong traffic and revenue trends. Prior to the issuance, Moody’s
noted that approximately 20 percent of AA2000’s revenues are generated from international
travel into Argentina, which helped to partially de-link the bond issue from risks related to local
macroeconomic conditions. Moody’s also noted that most of AA2000’s revenues are
denominated or indexed to the US dollar, which helps to reduce exchange rate risks.6 The bond
issues were used to refinance USD 180 million of 2010 notes that were set to expire in 2020.
AA2000 hired Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer to assist in placing the bond.
       iii.       Multi-Sector
44.    Compañía Latinoamericana de Infraestructura & Servicios S.A (CLISA), a
subsidiary of the Roggio Group, issued USD 300 million in bonds on the Irish Stock
Exchange. CLISA is mainly engaged in construction, waste management, water distribution, and

transportation. The mid-2016 issuance involved USD 200 million and USD 100 million tranches,
which both having 9.50 percent coupons and 7-year maturities.
45.     There is increasing acceptance by investors for Argentine corporate bonds. As shown
in Figure 4 there is recent evidence indicating that spreads between corporate and sovereign bond
issues have been narrowing in recent months with average maturities going out to seven years.
This figure includes recent corporate bond issues for a variety of industries, including
infrastructure energy, and construction sectors.

46.     Peso-linked bonds are a relatively new instrument that is also starting to obtain
market acceptance. Three companies—Supervielle, Tarjeta Naranja, and YPF—have recently
issued “peso linked bonds? in which the bonds are priced, denominated, and repaid in USD.
However, the performance of peso-linked bonds is linked to changes in the weight of the
respective local rates, in this way foreign investors can take advantage of potential upside relating
to high local currency yields. This instrument can serve as a temporary measure until long-term
hedging instruments are developed in the local capital markets.

C.      Sub-Sovereign Bonds

47.     The GoA and the provincial governments are currently re-evaluating and
negotiating the structure of the Federal Co-Participation scheme. This system is used by the
GoA to divide and allocate revenues generated from income taxes, fuel taxes, national service
transfers and other miscellaneous tax transfers. The distribution formula is two tiered. The first
distribution is between the Federal and the provincial governments followed by a second
distribution, which is among the provincial governments. Funds from the co-participation
scheme can be used as collateral to secure and issue bonds. Only four sub-sovereign entities—
the Municipality of Buenos Aires and the Provinces of Neuquén, Chubut, and Santa Cruz—
receive at least 50 percent of revenues from locally imposed taxes and fees. The remaining
provinces are heavily reliant on the Federal Co-Participation scheme. For example, the provinces
of Jujuy, La Rioja, and Santiago del Estero, receive over 90 percent from the Federal
government.


                                                      20
48.     There has also been flurry of bonds issued by sub-sovereign governments totaling
approximately USD 8.4 billion in debt. The Government of Argentina’s issuance of sovereign
bonds in April 2016 has helped to pave the way for municipal and provincial governments to
return to the international capital markets. As of this writing, an estimated 12 of 23 provinces and
two municipalities have issued local and/or dollar denominated bonds with an additional 2
provinces, Tierra del Fuego and Santa Cruz provinces, planning to issue bonds in the near term.
Neuquén and Mendoza placed bonds shortly thereafter in May 2016, which has subsequently
been followed by several other local governments. Moody’s has recently upgraded the credit
ratings of most provincial governments from Caa1 to B3 rating with either a positive or stable
outlooks. Moody’s reaffirmed the ratings for the municipalities of Buenos Aires and Cordoba
along with four provinces in early March 2017.7
49.     Most of the municipal bonds have been listed internationally and traded locally. The
bonds are governed by the laws of the State of New York, listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, and traded on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. Interest rates have ranged from 6.50
percent to 9.95 percent or approximately 100 to 300 basis points above the sovereign bonds.
Bond maturities have ranged from six to eleven years. Most of the municipal bond issues have
involved international placement and denominated in hard currencies. In a few cases, these
recent bond issues have represented refinancing of previously issued bonds.
50.     Notably, the USD 200 million bond issued by La Rioja Province is the first “Green
Bond? in Argentina. Although technically La Rioja’s bond issue has not been formally
classified as a Green Bond, it fulfills most of the internationally recognized requirements,
including the financing of sustainable projects and annual reporting. The bond is financing a 100
MW wind farm (USD 170 million) and a transmission line (USD 30 million). Based on the
framework developed by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
for Green Bonds, La Rioja’s bond issue would be considered as a “Use of Proceeds? Green Bond
(Table 4).

51.      Bond proceeds have tended to be used for a combination of refinancing and
infrastructure projects. A review of a small sample of Offering Statement (OS) reports
indicated that bonds proceeds are used to only partially finance infrastructure improvements. For
example, the Province of Chubut’s bond issue specified that 50 percent of the bond proceeds will
be used to refinance previously issued debt with the remaining 50 percent would be to finance:
(i) infrastructure works in the municipalities of the Province; (ii) infrastructure works in rural
areas; and (iii) other works in the Province.

1. Standard & Poor’s ratings as Moody’s rating not available

52.     Collateral, reserve accounts, and trigger events helped to provide investor comfort.
Collateral includes royalties from hydrocarbons concessions and first priority security interest
from the reserve accounts—a Collateral Account, Argentine Dollar Debt Service Reserve
Account, Argentine Peso Debt Service Reserve Account, and an Argentine Trigger Event
Prepayment Account. Since the Province of Chubut also draws revenues from taxes and royalties
from hydrocarbons, there is also an Argentine Extraordinary Royalties Prepayment Account. The
event trigger is if the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) falls below 1.35 times.
53.     Terms have tended to be better for larger issues. Market participants reported that the
Province of Santa Fe had to pay a “liquidity premium? of approximately 40 basis points, since its
bond issue was below USD 300 million. In contrast, the Province of Buenos Aires’ issue had a
yield of 6.5 percent of an issuance of 750 million.

8
   Tierra del Fuego was initially looking to issue a bond in October 2016 but delayed the issue due to uncertainties
relating to the U.S. Election. The Province’s other international bond issuance was in 1997, which was repaid in
2003. These notes were rated C by Fitch upon the receipt of the final maturity payment.

                                                        22
54.     Most sub-sovereign entities are relatively new to the international capital markets.
Debt management policies tend to vary considerably among local governments depending on
experience. While the Province of Buenos Aires and Municipality of Buenos Aires have
historical experience with issuing debt, the provinces of Tierra del Fuego, Entre Rios and Santa
Cruz have limited experience. Standard and Poor’s noted that the Province of Entre Rios sold its
foreign currency denominated debt despite lacking a formal debt policy or debt office. These
bonds were 250 basis points higher than the sovereign reference curve.
55.     Better terms were offered for foreign currency bonds for the Provinces that are less
reliant on Federal revenues. The Province of Buenos Aires, which obtains 12 percent of its
financial resources from locally generated revenues obtained a 7.87 percent coupon for the bond
issued in June 2016 with roughly similar maturities. On the other end, the bond issued by the
Province of Chaco, which derives over 80 percent of its revenues from the Federal government
and has among the lowest per capita income, had a coupon of 9.375 percent. These bonds were
rated Caa1 by Moody’s.
56.    Although currency risk remains an issue, this risk appears to be relatively
manageable given that over 93 percent of the issued debt has been denominated in foreign
currency. This risk also varies at the local level as some sub-sovereign governments, e.g.
Neuquén, Salta, Santa Cruz, Mendoza, and Chubut generate revenues in foreign currency, which
reduces the potential risk of currency mismatches. However, this risk is greater in other
provinces, such as Santa Fe and Cordoba, which do not generate income directly in dollars.
57.     Despite the activity and interest in foreign currency denominated bonds, local
currency bonds represent the next growth area for capital markets development. A positive
starting point are the local currency bonds issued by the Municipality of Buenos Aires and the
Province of Misiones. The Municipality of Buenos Aires issued ARS 5,085 million (USD 331
million) and ARS 3,708 million (USD 235 million bond in March 2017). However, these bonds
were characterized by relatively high interest rates and short maturities. The interest rate on the
bonds were BADLAR + 3.25 percent (approximately 23 percent in nominal terms) and
BADLAR + 5.0 percent (approximately 24.75 percent), respectively. The higher interest rate on
the latter bond reflected the longer maturity of 5.0 years compared to 1.5 years for the lower
priced bond. The Municipality, which has a Moody’s credit rating of Baa for local currency debt
and a per capita GDP of USD 23,600, was one of the few public entities along with the Province
of Tierra del Fuego that did not default on its debt after 2001. The Municipality of Buenos Aires
is attempting to reduce its reliance on foreign currency debt from 95 percent of total debt to
roughly 50 percent of total debt over the next few years. The bonds issued by Misiones
represented a debt restructuring, was facilitated by ANSES, the public pension and social
security scheme. The medium to long-term goal is for the market to provide more attract terms
and longer maturities for these instruments.

58.     Finally, there not have been any recent issuances of infrastructure project bonds .
This market remains underdeveloped for foreign and local currency bonds. Macroeconomic risks
and structural issues, such as the absence of a PPP project pipeline, are some of the barriers that
have precluded the issuance of project bonds.

D.    Institutional Investors
       i.       Insurance Companies
59.      Despite recent reforms, the financing of infrastructure from institutional investors
faces several challenges. In contrast with other countries in the region, Argentina lacks the
institutional investor base with sufficient assets under management (AUM) to anchor
infrastructure financing. Thus, in the short to medium term, any financing via the capital markets
would likely require the participation of foreign-based institutional investors.

60.     The private insurance market is underdeveloped and with an outmoded legal and
regulatory framework. The insurance sector comprises approximately 2 to 3 percent of GDP.
The law that governs insurance activities was enacted in the 1950s, amended during 1970s, and
needs to be updated to meet current conditions in the international market as well as to diversify
the types of products that can be offered. Insurance companies have historically been prohibited
from the following: (i) investing outside of Argentina; and (ii) the type of investment products,
e.g. closed funds. These restrictions have resulted in the overall poor quality of investments
made by insurance companies as well as restricted the ability to diversify risk. Additional issues
include the accounting rules for sector investments and investment strategies. As of this writing,
there has been almost no investment by insurance companies in infrastructure.
61.    The private insurance market is highly fragmented with a strong concentration on a
few insurance products. The primarily focus has been the provision of insurance for
automobiles and workers’ compensation which comprises an estimated 60 to 80 percent of the
market in terms of market value. Of the estimated 180 insurance companies operating in
Argentina, 30 provide only workers’ compensation, 30 provide reinsurance products, and 120
companies are general insurers offering a limited range of products. However, approximately 75
percent of the general insurance companies tend to be small, niche firms. The national insurance
superintendency, Superindencia de Seguros de la Nación or SSN, is also conducting a market
analysis of the sector with the objective of attracting larger market players that can offer a wider
range of products at competitive market rates.

62.   However, the overall size of the insurance sector remains relatively small and
decreased slightly from 2005 to 2015. In 2005, insurance industry company assets accounted


                                                  25
for 2.8 percent of GDP, which was below Brazil (6.2%), Chile (19.6), Colombia (4.1%), Mexico
(3.6%), and Peru (3.6%). The size of the insurance sector in relation to GDP has decreased
slightly and then rebounded and was 2.6 percent at the end of 2015. In the intervening years, the
gap with other countries in the region has grown significantly in relation to other large
economies region. The insurance sector accounts for over 6 percent of GDP in Colombia,
Mexico, and Peru and nearly 12 percent in Brazil.

63.     The size of mutual fund assets has grown slightly but similarly remains small . The
size of the mutual fund industry is estimated to be USD 17 billion in 2015 and USD 20 billion in
2016.9. Mutual funds in Argentina accounted for approximately 1.8 percent of GDP in 2005,
increasing to 2.6 percent in 2015. This percentage remains below Chile (18.0%), Mexico (9.3%)
and Peru (3.4%). However, the mutual fund in Colombia is extremely small, accounting for only
0.1 percent of GDP in 2015.
64.     The tax amnesty program has generated renewed interest to re-establish closed end
mutual funds, which have been non-existent. Offshore assets held by Argentine nationals is
estimated to be USD 400 to 500 billion.10 The tax amnesty program announced in May 2016 (“El
Blanqueo?) could provide additional funding for infrastructure. The tax amnesty program offers
the following options: (i) declare previously undeclared assets but pay a penalty up to 15 percent;
(ii) purchase zero interest government bonds with severe trading restrictions; or (iii) invest in
closed-end funds for a minimum of five years. In the first six months, the tax amnesty program
brought in an estimated USD 4.6 billion. Private estimates are that the tax amnesty program
could bring in a total of USD 16 billion.11 Several firms have hired specialists to evaluate and
structure potential investments managed by closed end funds.12

   The Cámara Argentina de Fondos Comunes de Inversión estimates that the value of the mutual fund industry was
298 billion pesos.

   This range is based on separate estimates calculated by the Economic and Financial Center for the Development
of Argentina and Tax Justice Network for Latin America and the Caribbean, respectively

65.     A U.S. based hedge fund, PointState Argentum owns the largest equity stake (44
percent) in Genneia, which has been awarded multiple RenovAR projects. PointState
Argentum and Point State Blockhouse (collectively PointState) are private hedge funds managed
by PointState Capital LP. Genneia’s equity holding are also held by Fintech Energy (25 percent),
private individuals (25 percent) and LAIG (6 percent). In addition to the RenovAR projects
(Table 9 and Table 10, pp. 37-38), Genneia also owns and operates the 77.4 MW Rawson Wind
Park in Chubut Province and nine geothermal energy generation facilities which have a
combined generation capacity of 280 MW.
    iii.        Pensions
66.     Argentina has had no private pension funds since the 2008 nationalization . The
assets of these funds are now held by the Sustainable Guaranty Fund (Fondo de Garantía de
Sustentabilidad, FGS), a part of the national social security administration (Administración
Nacional de la Seguridad Social, ANSES) resulting in the creation of a state fund with AUM of
approximately USD 50 billion. The investment regime allows ANSES to invest up to 100
percent of the FGS portfolio in assets with real guarantees, up to 50 percent in government
securities, and up to 20 percent in infrastructure. As of 2016, FGS’s portfolio is currently
invested as follows: 12 percent equity, 68 percent public sector bonds, 10 percent infrastructure
projects, and a small portion in local mutual funds. ANSES currently faces restrictions with
respect to market activity, the most significant of which is a prohibition on share and corporate
bond trading.

67.    ANSES has been evaluating strategies for divesting its investments in several
infrastructure companies. Through FGS, ANSES currently holds minority equity positions in



                                                   27
approximately 44 companies, including infrastructure service providers and banks. To increase
the amount of available capital to meet future pension liabilities. Within infrastructure, this
includes including energy generation companies (e.g. Pampa Energy and Central Puerto, S.A.),
electricity transmission (e.g. Transener), electricity distribution (e.g. Edenor), and transportation
(e.g. Metrovías). Nearly half of the firms held by FGS provide a dividend to ANSES. ANSES
has been evaluating strategies to divest its equity participation in these companies. The first
equity transactions involved the sale of Petrobras Argentina to Pampa Energy. The second
transaction occurred in March 2017 in which ANSES sold its participation in Solvay Indupa, a
chemical company, to the Brazilian firm, Unipar Carbocloro. The list of companies in which
ANSES held an equity stake at the end of 2015 is listed in Annex 1.
68.    The recent Supreme Court decision may have a significant impact on the financial
position of the ANSES. Since 1992, the GoA began taking 15 percent from each province’s
contribution to the Federal Co-Participation to fund the National Social Security Administration
(ANSES). In late 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that this contribution was unconstitutional and
required the GoA to return funds plus accumulated interest to the provinces that had been
withheld starting from 2006. The negotiated amount due to the provinces is ARG 86 billion
which is expected to be repaid in installments by 2020.
      iv.          Other Equity

69.      There were two Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) involving Argentine corporate
entities during 2016, representing the first since 2010. The first involved Havanna
(HAVH.BA), which makes alfajores and manages over 300 coffee shops in Latin America was
the first to go public selling approximately 10 percent of its shares. Most of the orders for equity
shares came from external markets. Subsequently, Grupo Superville SA (SUPV.BA), a banking
company, listed its shares in Buenos Aires and New York exchanges, raising USD 281 million.
With respect to infrastructure companies, Corporación América, which is a holding company for
its partial ownership stakes in Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 and Compañía General de
Combustibles along with microchips and agriculture businesses, was planning an IPO, but was
delayed due to an unresolved a dispute with U.S. based creditors involving unpaid debt. This IPO
requires approval from the GoA due to its 15 percent ownership in the airports company.
70.     Financing construction using value capture strategies is an emerging area. In
Argentina, sub-sovereign governments can finance certain public works through the assessment
of betterment taxes (contribuciones de mejoras) when it can be demonstrated that the
infrastructure project will result in increased land values. As a rule, sub-sovereign governments
“identify certain categories of beneficiaries and share part of the cost of construction among
them in proportion to the estimated benefit.?13 This seems to imply that the value capture
strategies have historically been used more for cost-recovery rather than revenue generation.

                                                 28
E.      Capital Market Issues

71.     The cash flow profile for financing infrastructure, typically involves large capital
outflows during construction, followed by initial revenue generation and then more robust
growth over time. This is known anecdotally as the “J-curve.? Consequently, infrastructure
assets typically require long-term financing that can match project cash flows during operations
to repay interest and principal and to generate an adequate return on equity, if applicable. To
provide lenders with greater certainty that project cash flows are sufficient over time to cover
debt payments, it is necessary that systemic risks can be controlled sufficiently so that the private
sector can price, manage, and mitigate project and non-project specific risks. The latter includes
the following:
    Macroeconomic risks, which includes GDP growth which impacts project revenue generation
     as well as inflation and foreign exchange to avoid potential mismatches between revenue and
     debt obligations.
    Banking sector risks. This refers to the ability and interest of banks to lend and to provide
     long-term maturities.
    Public sector risks, which can include the following (i) legal and regulatory changes; (ii)
     political, including changes in government administrations; (iii) policy uncertainty; (iv)
     borrower creditworthiness; and (v) expropriation.
    Corporate sector risks, including the ability of corporate entities: (i) to obtain debt financing
     at acceptable terms; (ii) to manage existing and future leverage levels; (iii) to rollover short-
     term debt; (iv) to maintain sufficient profitability; and (v) to adequate manage the corporate
     entity or SPV.
    Market and liquidity risks impact the price and availability of debt financing.
This assessment is limited to risks that impact the financing of tendered and awarded
infrastructure projects. Project specific risks, such as construction, environmental, land
acquisition, permitting, and geotechnical risks, are outside of the scope of this analysis. These
risks require feasibility and pre-feasibility, risk workshops, and risk mitigation strategies that are
unique for each project.
72.     The key risks are macroeconomic risks, particularly inflation and foreign exchange
risk, followed by policy uncertainty. Foreign lenders and investors continue to be missing from
the domestic capital markets. This applies to equity, fixed income, and non-listed direct
investments. Macroeconomic conditions, especially high inflation and high nominal interest
rates, explain the following:
 the limited ability of the government to issue domestic currency treasury securities that could
    help form a yield curve;
 the general absence of domestic long term finance for corporates, local governments, SMEs,
    housing, and infrastructure;
 the preference for issuance of securities in dollars, and the appetite of investors for dollars as
    the only viable instrument for long term saving; and
 the difficulties in establishing long-term hedging instruments for managing foreign exchange
    risk.

                                                  29
73.    It is expected that inflation will be brought down to more manageable levels during
2017; but reaching single digit inflation is a medium-term goal. The IMF’s most recent
forecast published in April 2017 estimated that consumer prices would increase by 25.6 percent
and 18.7 percent in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In the medium term, alternative solutions might
be needed to foster the development of a long-term finance market, such as the use of inflation-
linked instruments. Progress has been made with the recent issuance of Peso-linked notes by
Argentine corporate entities. However, the development of these type of instruments is not
without challenges. These issues will be further explored in the section on infrastructure
financing.

74.     During the previous government administration, there was limited credibility
associated with the inflation index. The lack of a credible inflation index made it extremely
difficult for underwriters to accurately price and investors to purchase domestic currency bonds.
While the credibility is slowing being restored, it is important that the GoA maintains the
independence of the National Statistics and Censuses Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadística
y Censos, INDEC).

75.     There are also several procedural and regulatory barriers that will continue to be a
deterrent for foreign investors, even were the macroeconomic and policy environment to
improve. These barriers include onerous account opening, know your client, and tax registration
procedures and requirements. However, it is understood that KYC requirements are currently
being reviewed with the objective of rationalizing them, including relying on the due diligence
performed by foreign regulated entities. In addition, it is understood that some capital controls
remain, including a minimum investment period of 120 days for foreign investment. Foreign
investors are also waiting for the GoA to complete and implement the ongoing reforms in the
financial sector, capital markets, and PPPs.

76.     Structural issues would also need to be addressed for the capital markets to play a
role in infrastructure financing. On the financing side, where infrastructure projects have USD
earnings, onshore and offshore dollar markets are likely to develop. However, financing for peso
earning projects remains an open question. Solutions to address currency risk do not seem
available in the short term due to the high inflation and interest rates. In the medium term, the
development of inflation linked instruments might be an option; however, this is not without
risks and needs a calibrated application once interest rates are brought down.

77.    There are other structural issues that could affect the long-term development of the
capital markets: ensuring that the Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV) becomes a credible
and effective supervisor should be a key objective, particularly as the market grows in size
and complexity. The proposed capital markets law attempts to address some of these issues.
Additional steps have already been taken in this direction, with the appointment of a new board,
which has embarked on a wholesale review of the organization. There is a need to continue
working on (i) improving supervision, through the implementation of risk-based supervision at
the micro-level and the development of a process for identifying risks at the market level, and (ii)
developing and implementing a credible and effective enforcement strategy. In the meantime, the
framework for ensuring independence and accountability will need to be strengthened.

                                                30
78.      Although the enactment of the proposed Capital Markets Law is intended to reduce
market inefficiencies, additional legislation is needed to deepen and widen local capital
markets. This law, which is still under legislative review, may not go far enough to develop the
institutional investor base needed to provide long-term financing for infrastructure. Additionally,
provisions could be added or new legislation could be developed that would: (i) encourage
insurance companies to offer new types of products; (ii) rebuild private pension systems by
incentivizing the establishment of asset management companies; (iii) providing preferential tax
treatment for closed end mutual funds (e.g. Colombia) or value capture adjacent to real estate
(e.g. Colombia and the United States); (iv) supporting the establishment of REITs; (v) reviewing
the governance structure, mission, and investment strategy of the FGS; (vi) encourage the
development of long-term hedging instruments to manage currency risk; and (viii) incentivize
the issuance of local currency bonds and project bonds while developing a peso/dollar hedge
market.

79.      The improved sovereign credit rating has been a key driver of the recent sub-
sovereign and corporate bond issues. In early April 2016, Standard & Poor’s upgraded
Argentina’s sovereign ratings for local and foreign currency debt to B from B-. This follows the
ratings upgrade from Moody’s which raised Argentina’s sovereign rating for foreign currency
denominated debt from C1 to B3 in 2016. This rating was re-affirmed by Moody’s in early 2017.
The perception in the market is that the Moody’s may raise this rating based on its forecast
growth in GDP of 3 percent for 2017-8 and the expected reduction in the fiscal deficit from 4.6
percent in 2016 to 3.9 percent for 2017. Moody’s has forecasted an additional 1 percent decrease
in the fiscal deficit.
80.     Lenders have been relatively inactive in the financing of infrastructure. As a rule,
lenders tend to be heavily involved in the financing of infrastructure due to their relative ability
to provide long-term debt financing and to develop financial structures that can sculpt the
amount of interest paid during project construction. The absence of active PPP projects that have
been tendered and reached commercial close has effectively precluded the participation of
lenders. Going forward, the issues that will impact the participation of lenders are: (i) the timing
of the drafting and implementation of the underlying regulatory framework for PPPs; (ii) the
development of a project pipeline and tender schedule; and (iii) macroeconomic conditions.
Additionally, the lack of long-term hedging instruments makes it more difficult to attract foreign
based banks. The ability of the renewable energy projects to obtain bank financing will serve as
an important benchmark for the rest of the PPP program. Although the relatively strong interest
in the RenovAR program, which has been supported by a guarantee facility, provides positive
feedback regarding investor interest, the real test is the ability and time that it takes for these
projects to reach close of finance and begin construction.
81.     The FODER model could potentially be replicated. The GoA has allocated ARS 12
billion (USD 860 million at current exchange rates) to FODER, which is divided into two
separate accounts. The project finance account, which is funded by a mix of treasury funds,
public offerings, ANSES and funds from multilateral institutions, will be used to offer long-term
project loans, provide interest rate subsidies and equity contributions to renewable energy
generation project companies and special purpose vehicles (SPV). A separate payment guarantee
account will be used for all PPAs tendered through the RenovAR program. This account must

                                                31
always have on deposit at least 12 months of payments due by the offtaker. Although this
account is primarily funded by a specific charge to consumers, if at any point FODER does not
have enough funds, then the Government of Argentina is obligated to replenish the account or
the partial guarantee kicks in, if the contractual triggers apply. This mitigates the risk that
CAMMESA will lack sufficient funds to purchase the power contracted under the PPAs.
Winning bidders take advantage of FODER’s protections by signing an accession agreement
with the FODER trustee at the time the PPA is signed. The partial credit guarantee facility was
available to investors after the conclusion of RenovAR Round 1 and Round 1.5.
82.     Market perception of bonds issued by sub-sovereign entities are strongly linked to
the sovereign debt market. Moody’s raised the foreign currency ratings of four provinces
(Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Mendoza, and Chubut) and three municipalities (Buenos Aires,
Cordoba, Río Cuarto) from Caa1 to B3 shortly after the national government re-entered the
international capital markets. Moody’s similarly raised the local currency ratings for these sub-
sovereign entities. Additionally, Moody’s raised the foreign and local currency ratings for the
provinces of Chubut and Formosa from Caa2 to Caa1 with only the former having issued debt, as
of this writing. Some investors have raised concerns that sub-sovereign bonds maybe the first to
be sold off, if there is a softening in the overall bond market in Argentina or a negative change in
macroeconomic conditions
83.     The level of liquidity for sub-sovereign debt has not yet been determined. Although
investor appetite has been relatively strong, it is difficult to ascertain the level of liquidity for
sub-sovereign debt. In some cases, bond yields have tightened. For example, the yield for bonds
issued by the Province of Salta and Cordoba decreased by nearly 100 bp and 30 bp, respectively,
after secondary trading.
84.     Despite the recent bond issues by sub-sovereign entities, indebtedness levels
currently appear to be manageable. For example, the Province of Cordoba raised debt levels
from 35 percent to 40 percent of revenues. However, Moody’s expects that downward pressures
on its credit rating would have to reach at least 50 percent of revenues before a ratings action
would be initiated. Cordoba’s operating margin averaged 11.7 percent from 2011-15 despite high
inflation and the devaluation of the ARG peso.14
85.     The Offering Statements prepared for the foreign placed bonds issued by the sub-
sovereign governments serve as useful models for the disclosure of information. Although
the quality and accessibility may vary by issuer, a limited review of offering statements (OS)
indicated that these documents were relatively easier to find and download and are consistent
with international best practices. More importantly, the OS documents included summaries
designed to assist qualified investors in making informed decision. This include summaries of
the following: (i) macroeconomic data; (ii) recent financial performance, including sources of
revenues from local and federal sources; (iii) current and capital expenditures; (iv) collateral; (v)
debt reserve accounts; (vi) risk factors regarding repayment of interest and principal; (vii) use of
proceeds; (viii) outstanding local and foreign currency denominated debt by maturity, type, and
creditor; and (ix) ongoing litigation.
86.   A key element for determining the long-term sustainability is not only timely
repayment, but also how the bond proceeds are used. Although sub-sovereign and corporate

entities have obtained debt capital through the international capital markets, the success and
sustainability of these initiatives as an aggregate is contingent on the extent that bond proceeds
are used to invest in infrastructure. This involves the financing of infrastructure projects that
encourage economic development, reducing the infrastructure deficit, and extending basic
services. An initial survey seems to show that non-sovereign debt has been used for financial
support, such as the refinancing outstanding debt and to close budget gaps as well as for
economic development purposes. For example, there is anecdotal evidence that the Province of
Argentina is using its large debt program for both purposes. Additional analysis and monitoring
is needed to determine how bond proceeds are being used and development incentives, such as
preferential tax treatment to encourage the financing of infrastructure.
87.     Retail investors have not invested in the stock or non-government bond markets,
either as long-term investors in securities, or as active traders. Although there has been some
retail participation in mutual funds, this is not significant. Retail investors prefer USD
denominated investments due to inflation and confidence concerns. There seem to be sizeable
holdings of retail assets in two categories, neither of which are in the formal domestic financial
sector, and do not benefit the development of local capital markets. These include: (i) an
estimated USD 1 to 3 billion in safety deposit boxes with domestic banks, and (ii) between USD
3 to 5 billion in holdings and investments abroad. There is potential for the growth of the
domestic retail investor base through repatriation of foreign assets. There is also a significant
level of retail participation in Peso denominated LEBACs, (CB issued short term paper) as these
instruments provide returns close to that of inflation. Investors participate in LEBACs through
online banking platforms. However, this is currently crowding out investments in other
instruments.

II.          Financing of Infrastructure through the Capital Markets

      A.         The Normative Framework for PPPs

      88.     There are several existing PPP contracts, especially in the transport sectors. These
      include: (i) a concession contract for the National Airport System in 2000; (ii) independent
      power producer (IPP) generation projects tendered prior to 2000; and (iii) road concession
      projects that were delivered through CREMA15 contracts, most of which are set to expire in
      2017. The CREMA contracts can be extended for an additional period.
      89.    A new PPP law was enacted in November 2016. The new PPP law (88-S-16 OD 815).
      was based on international best practices and clarified some elements that had been missing from
      previous legislation. However, controversial elements were also included in the final version of
      the law. Key features of the legislation are summarized as follows:
      i. Local Content Requirement. The new PPP law requires that 33 percent of the contract
         value be awarded to local firms, including SMEs. The Ministry of Production can provide
         exceptions or limit this requirement. Although the local content requirement may not be an
         issue in the roads sector as sufficient technical capacity currently exists in Argentina, this
         requirement may potentially disincentivize investment in the energy, water & sanitation, and
         irrigation sectors.

  ii. Contract Duration. The new PPP Law permits concession and PPP contracts of 35 years
      including extensions.

  iii. Contract Renegotiations. Article 9 (i) prevents contract negotiations of more than 20
       percent of the total contract value. However, the Law is silent regarding the total number of
       renegotiations that can take place during the contract period.

  iv. Ministerial Approvals. Article 6 states that the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable
      Development is required to review compliance with national environmental laws and
      regulations prior to contractual approval (Article 5).

      v. Congressional Notifications. Article 9 (x) requires Congressional notification if a contract
         dispute requires arbitration. In addition, the Bicameral Commission for monitoring PPPs can
         request information regarding the fulfillment of local content, technology transfer and human
         resource requirements (Article 12).

  vi. Fiscal Impact Requirements. These include the following:
         Article 6 requires that the Ministry of Hacienda must provide a specific budget line
           item in the monthly “Ahorro-Inversión Financiamiento?
         Article 16 and Article 32 establishes that direct and indirect obligations stemming from
           PPP contracts cannot exceed more than 7 percent of GDP in any given year except for
           2017 and 5 percent for 2017, respectively. After 2017, this limit can be reevaluated
           annually based on budget appropriations.

                                                       34
          Article 20 requires the creation of reserve funds to meet outstanding fiscal obligations.
          Guarantees having a fiscal impact would require Congressional approval as well as the
           appropriation of sufficient budgetary resources, if the project guarantee is invoked.

vii. Trusts. The PPP law reaffirms the use of trusts and sociedad anonimas as per Law 26,831.

viii. Step-In Rights. Allows for step-in rights for lenders allowing the restructuring of debt for
      projects that are unable to repay debt service

 ix. Feasibility Studies. Article 13 requires the following feasibility studies and reports:
       Business case for the PPP delivery method selected
       Additional fiscal and budget impact of the project
       Fiscal impact of the project during the contract term
       Availability of public resources to meet public obligations
       Project externalities
       Employment impact, nationally and on small and medium enterprises
       Socio-economic impact
       Cost-benefit analysis, including risks, regarding the PPP delivery option selected
       Risk allocation and sharing

  x. Early Termination. Article 9 (p) and Article 10 more clearly define termination clauses due
     to mutual agreement, cause, and without cause as well as authorized compensation for early
     termination.

 xi. Arbitration. Article 9 (x) sets forth that the parties involved can go to arbitration in the event
     of a contractual dispute.

xii. PPP Unit. The New Law mandates the creation of a PPP Unit. The PPP unit is intended to be
     a consultative, rather than an approving entity.

xiii. Sub-sovereign entities. Article 33 implies that the new PPP law is not binding for sub-
      sovereign entities, particularly the Province of Buenos Aires.

xiv. Article 9 of the new PPP law expressly states that the revised regulatory framework
      must address the following topics (by section number):
     a) Contract duration
     b) Risk allocation
     c) Roles and responsibilities of contractual parties
     d) Oversight mechanisms
     e) Minimum technical requirements
     f) Payment mechanism
     g) Direct financial resources from the public sector
     h) Mechanisms for handling technological changes
     i) Contract renegotiations
     j) Changes to the project financial equilibrium

                                                   35
     k) Minimum revenue guarantees
     l) Other contractual guarantees
     m) The authority to confer guarantees
     n) The role of the procuring authority in helping to secure financing
     o) Revenue generation and the securitization of revenues post-contract award
     p) Early contract termination
     q) Credit guarantees
     r) Equity transfers and sales
     s) Temporary contract suspension in the event of non-compliance
     t) The partial or complete transfer of the contract to a 3rd party (provided that 20% of the
        investment has been completed and with the consent of the lenders).
     u) Subcontracting
     v) Asset handback
     w) Dispute resolution
     x) Arbitration

90.      However, the new PPP law does not define the institutional framework for the
development and implementation of the underlying legal and regulatory frameworks. This
has led to great deal of uncertainty and institutional competition which had delayed the
establishment of the PPP unit specified under the legislation. In turn, institutional uncertainty has
delayed the development of a pipeline of potentially bankable PPP projects as well as limited
coordination among the line ministries to determine the timing of project tenders. The PPP unit
that is now housed under the Ministry of Finance is short-staffed with a 2-3 part-time individuals
dedicated to the PPP program.
91.    The new PPP law permits sub-sovereign entities to develop and deliver
infrastructure projects through a PPP structure. The Municipality of Buenos Aires as well as
the Province of Province of Buenos Aires and Province of Cordoba have expressed an interest in
developing projects through PPPs. The enactment and implementation of the regulatory
framework for PPPs at the national level is necessary first step for sub-sovereign entities to
develop a PPP framework that is consistent with the national framework. The recent enactment
of regulatory reforms underlying the PPP law may spur the development of PPP frameworks at
the sub-sovereign level.
B.        Potential Refinements to the Normative Framework

92.    To help attract private sector capital and address the issues cited above, the
following issues should be clarified or expanded in subsequent versions of the PPP
regulations.
     i.   Renegotiations. There is a need to define: (1) the total number of renegotiations that can
          take place during the contract term, and (2) whether the 20 percent limit applies for each
          separate renegotiation or all renegotiations agreed during the contract term.

 ii.      Early Termination. Expand the guidelines related to early termination due to a Force
          Majeure event.


                                                  36
 iii.   Arbitration. The regulation should be clear as to (1) under what conditions arbitration
        would take place; (2) the process for going to arbitration; and; (3) the arbitration location.
        The PPP law requires that the GoA must approve as well as inform Congress that a
        contractual dispute requires arbitration. However, this requirement could create a barrier
        to investment as sponsors may be concerned that the GoA will grant arbitration only if it
        is a plaintiff. Moreover, the law seems to imply that arbitration can take place solely in
        Argentina. This would need to be clarified as international investors prefer having the
        option that arbitration takes place outside of the project country to ensure the
        independence and transparency of the arbitration panel.

 iv.    Ministry of Environment Reviews. Article 5 should be clarified so that is clear what is
        meant by having the Ministry of Environment “tomar intervención? in the review of a
        contract with the private sector. Potential delays in contract approval could create
        uncertainties that might limit private investment.

  v.    Feasibility Studies. Provide guidance with respect to independent feasibility studies,
        specifically: (1) how the feasibility and risk analyses will be applied: (2) who should
        perform the risk analyses, e.g. universities, private companies, etc., and (3) whether the
        results of the risk analysis could result in project cancellation or restructuring.
        Additionally, the regulatory guidelines could establish ranges for the value of the
        identified project risks and/or require the preparation of risk mitigation plans.

 vi.    Congressional notification and the submission of contractual documents in the event of
        arbitration. The supporting regulation should strike the right balance between requiring
        public disclosure while maintaining sufficient confidentiality of business information so
        as not to disincentivize potential investors and lenders.

93.    Another critical issue is the absence of a formal PPP project pipeline in Argentina.
This issue has been raised by market participants as being a potential impediment to the PPP
program. The development of a project pipeline is an important market signal that helps lenders
and investors mobilize scarce financial and human resources in relation to the timing and scale of
the projects being tendered. To develop a pipeline of potentially bankable PPP projects, it is
necessary to first develop a framework for evaluating, selecting, and prioritizing PPP projects
under consideration by the line ministries. A potential framework that has been adopted in other
countries is a multi-criteria analysis that assigns different weights to different categories, such as
development impact, timing, technical complexity, bankability, etc., among other factors.

94.    Market barriers may also play a role in the timing and level of interest of foreign
investors in PPP. The Odebrecht bribery scandal has not only impacted the political situation
and PPP program in Brazil, but throughout the region. The reverberations of this scandal include
the cancellation or re-tendering of large PPP projects in Colombia (Río Magdalena) and Peru
(Gasoducto Sur) that had been previously awarded to Odebrecht. Although this scandal may
eventually encourage the implementation of reforms in the PPP program, particularly in Peru, it
has slowed PPP project development in multiple jurisdictions. Moreover, the scandal has
highlighted the need for improved transparency and disclosure requirements. While the
Odebrecht scandal may discourage some sponsors and lenders from investing in the region,

                                                 37
others may see this as a potential opportunity to enter the market and invest in infrastructure. The
timing and magnitude of the projects to be tendered will help to drive investment decisions.




                                                38
III.        Project Pipeline

       95.      With the re-entry of Argentina into the international capital markets in early 2016,
       there has been significant interest from the private sector to invest in infrastructure,
       particularly in renewable energy projects. The estimated capital costs for the renewable
       energy program is approximately USD 15 billion. The RenovAR program managed by the
       Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM) successfully concluded two separate auction rounds
       resulting in the awarded of 37 projects that will generate 1,167 MW of wind energy and 918 MW
       of in solar energy upon completion. The projects have 20-year power purchase agreements
       (PPAs) with CAMMESA. This program is being supported by a USD 480 million partial credit
       guarantee facility. An estimated 10-12 projects are being evaluated in the transport sector and 4-
       8 pilot projects are being proposed for the water and irrigation sectors. Financing for renewable
       energy project awarded under RenovAR Round 1, includes corporate bonds from the project
       sponsors and sub-sovereign entities. Additionally, a corporate bond has also been issued to
       support capital projects for airports managed by Aeropuertos 2000. The financing models,
       contract types, and timing of the tenders for possible PPP transport and water sector projects are
       still being determined.

       A.      Renewable Energy Generation

       96.     Rather than waiting for a PPP law to be enacted, the RenovAR program was based
       on the Energy Generation Law (#27191) enacted in 2015. A total of 7 renewable energy
       projects were awarded under Round 1 and another 30 projects under Round 1.5. The megawatt
       per hour (MWh) spot market price ranged from USD 49 to USD 57. A new Energy Distribution
       Law is currently under consideration.
       97.    The GoA has set the goal of increasing the amount of electricity generation from
       renewables to 25 percent by 2025. The amount of electricity generated from renewables as a
       percent of total energy generation was 2 percent in 2016. Law #27191 established an
       intermediate target of 8 percent by the end of 2017. Industry estimates that a total of 2,000 MW
       can be generated using renewable energy sources.
       98.     Two auctions have been conducted the RenovAR program in 2016 which have been
       viewed by the Government and market participants as being successful . Bidders were
       awarded 415 MW wind projects along with 400 MW solar and 1 MW biomass during Round 1.16
       The level of interest from the private sector, which submitted 123 bids for more than 6,300 MW,
       led to additional awards.
       99.    Financing for the RenovAR round 1 projects is expected to comprise of a mix of
       corporate bonds and equity as well as MDB financing. The Villalonga Wind and Chubut
       Norte projects are expected to be financed through a corporate bond issued by Genneia. In
       contrast, the La Castellana Wind Project is expected to obtain a USD 50 million from the
       Investment Corporation (IIC) of the IADB which is using funds provided by the Green Climate
       Fund (GCF).17 In all, the GCF has approved USD 133 million for RenovAR projects. The
       16
          Bidders had offered 600 megawatts of wind, 300 megawatts of solar, 65 megawatts of biomass, 15 megawatts of
       biogas and 20 megawatts of small hydropower capacity
       17
          The GCF was established by 194 governments to limit or cut greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries,
       and to help vulnerable areas adapt to the impacts of climate change. The GCF is administered by the United Nations.

                                                               39
financing structures for the remaining projects have yet to be announced, as of this writing. The
average megawatt/hour for the wind and solar energy generation projects was USD 59.4 and
USD 59.7, respectively. The average MW/h for the 1.2 MW biomass project was USD 118.

100. The wholesale energy market administrator, CAMMESA, is the offtaker. This is a
significant change since CAMMESA’s corporate role, had historically been limited to market
regulation and dispatch activities. Contract terms require that CAMMESA maintain at least 6
months of reserve funds to meet its ongoing commitments. Historically, budget transfers
comprise 100 percent of CAMESA’s revenues, so that the reserve fund must be replenished
every six months by the GOA. Additional financial support is provided through the Fund for the
Development of Renewable Energy (Fondo para el Desarrollo de Energías Renovables, FODER
operates as a trust to backstop ongoing financial obligations by CAMMESA or MINEM.
101. The power purchase agreements (PPAs) contain a put mechanism which is intended
to provide greater comfort to investors and financial institutions. The FODER structure also
provides the project developers with a put option to sell the power project back to the
government that can be exercised in any of the following situations. These include: (i) if the
offtaker fails to make payments over a certain period; (ii) a breach of an Argentine court
judgment or the dispute resolution clause in the PPA; (iii) the Argentine currency becomes
inconvertible or non-transferable; (iv) there is a change in certain Argentine laws; (v) the project
is expropriated, or (vi) an early termination of the PPA, the guarantee facility or the FODER
accession agreement. Any of these events will, after the conclusion of a specified cure period,
allows the winning bidder to sell the project to FODER based on the book value of the project.18

Additional funding proposals totaling USD 315.24 million approved during 2016. Were for projects in Mongolia,

The guarantee facility backstops Argentina’s obligation to fund FODER when it is required to
buy out a project due to of the exercise of the put option. The guarantee facility will be in place
until the earlier of 20 years, or Argentina obtaining an investment grade rating.19

     The IBRD guarantee is for up to 20 years, although sub-projects may request the guarantee for a shorter period.

102. Round 1.5 resulted in the award of 10 wind and 20 solar projects that is expected to
add another 1,282 MW solar and wind projects to the energy grid. The average MW/h of the
wind and the solar projects was USD 53.12 and USD 54.94, respectively. The MW/h costs for
the wind energy and solar energy projects, decreased by nearly 10 percent and 8 percent,
respectively, between the two RenovAR rounds. The developers for the awarded projects are in
the process of seeking financing for projects awarded during Round 1.5. Additional auction
rounds could take place during late 2017 or in 2018.
103. The technical and financial feasibility of waste-to energy generation facilities in the
Buenos Aires area is currently being examined. The Argentine Water and Sanitation
Company, (Aguas y Saneamiento Argentinos, S.A., AySA) is evaluating potential sites in the
Buenos Aires area in which it already owns the land to develop 1 to 3 waste-to-energy facilities
through a PPP. One of the proposed projects was tendered but has not reached close of finance
while the other two projects have not yet been tendered and are seeking potential investors. One
potential location includes a transmission line to deliver the generated energy and a rail
connection to transport solid waste to the generation plant. However, this site is somewhat
removed from the solid waste needed to generate energy, resulting in higher transport and
operating costs.
104. Another proposed site is closer to the solid waste facility and has access to a
transmission line, but lacks a suitable rail connection. Consequently, this proposed site could
have higher capital costs to develop a rail connection or to purchase new trucks. Proposed capital
costs depend on planned generation capacity, which range from 5 MW to 60 MW at full build-
out. Veolia, a France based company that operates energy, water, and transport projects globally,
has expressed interest in this project. Initial market sounding discussions have also been held
with Acciona (Spain) and General Electric (United States). Potential financing structures
includes revenues generated from existing facilities, funding from nearby municipalities, and
private equity. The PPA structure has yet to be determined.
B.     Transport

105. The Ministry of Transport has announced an ambitious USD 33 billion investment
plan for the transport sector. Approximately half of this amount, nearly USD 17.5 billion,
would be used to improve the surface road network. The investment plan involves a combination
of brownfield and greenfield projects which would be partially financed by private sector. Urban
rail and bus transit along with freight rail projects would comprise another 40 percent of the
proposed investment plan. Airports and ports account for the remainder of the proposed
investment plan with private capital being a component of the financing plan. Although this
investment plan has a three-year timeframe, this may be difficult to achieve given the amount of
the investment required, the timing of tender schedule, and the ongoing development and
implementation of the underlying regulating framework for PPPs. The subsequent figure
summarizes the transport investment plan by sector.

106. The 12 corridors would be tendered through 25-year management contracts. The
National Road Directorate (Dirección Nacional de Vialidad, DNV) is currently examining the
feasibility for tendering up to 12 brownfield road corridors. This review includes the preparation
and review of the financial models, initial evaluation of toll rates and policy, the review of the
legal and regulatory structure for PPPs, and the assessment of capital and operating expenses.
DNV is also examining the project specific risks, e.g. environmental, construction, etc., for each
corridor. The development of a project preparation facility, market sounding activities, and
tender schedule are currently under review.

107. Determination of tolling policy is critical for tendering and the financial structure of
road concession projects. Tolling options under consideration include: (i) maintaining the
existing tolling structure but increasing and indexing toll levels to reflect (a) inflation and (b) the
devaluation of peso to the US dollar; (ii) eliminating all tolls except for access roads into and
exiting Buenos Aires; (iii) adopting a shadow tolling structure (e.g. United Kingdom); and (iv)
incorporating a hybrid system with tolling and shadow tolls. Currency risk and indexation of
tolls are critical concerns both for international and local investors, particularly if project debt is
denominated in foreign currency. Minimum revenue guarantees backstopped by the Ministry of

                                                     43
Finance are under consideration. Although initial financial projections show positive net income
for most of these roads, these estimates do not include long-term lifecycle costs and the
replacement of toll equipment. Table 11 summarizes the proposed concession projects under
consideration.
108. The Municipality of Buenos Aires is also financing the construction of a 6.7 km
dedicated 4-lane underground expressway for trucks and buses though a bond issue. The
USD 650 million Paseo del Bajo would relieve congestion from truck entering the Port of
Buenos Aires. The project would connect the Illia, the Buenos Aires-La Plata Highway and the
25 de Mayo Highway. The project would run parallel to the Puerto Madero area. The project is
being financed through a combination of a bond issue and a USD 400 million loan from the
Andean Development Corporation (CAF).
109. The urban mobility program improvement program outlined by the Ministry of
Transport is extremely ambitious. A key component of this program involves the USD 8.5
billion construction of three passenger rail lines that would connect the three major train stations
in Buenos Aires (Retiro, Once and Constitución) creating a 790 km, 241 station rail network.
Stage 1 involves the construction of underground stations, access points, tunnel viaducts, and
electrification for the Roca-San Martin-Mitre rail line (USD 2.3 billion). Stage 2 of the urban rail
program would involve construction works along the Sarmiento-Mitre line (USD 5.4 billion)
including tunnels, stations, and the “undergrounding? of the Sarmiento line. Stage 3 would
involve the construction of Belgano North-South line (USD 800 million) which includes the
construction of viaducts and tunnels as well as and line electrification improvements. Additional
urban mobility projects under consideration include: (i) the expansion of rolling stock (USD 3.2
billion) and (ii) modernization Buenos Aires A, C and D subway lines (USD 500 million); and
(iii) the construction of a new Buenos Aires subway line (USD 900 million). These works, which
are summarized in

110. Figure 7, are scheduled to be tendered from the present through 2023. Additional road
surface mobility projects included in the long-term investment plan would be developed in Santa
Fé, Córdoba, Neuquén, and Corrientes.

111. The Ministry of Transport is planning to improve freight rail utilization and
efficiency through a nearly USD 15 billion improvement plan. At present, only 5 percent of
freight is transported through by rail, representing approximately 18 million tons per year.
Moreover, the freight rail system operates at low efficiency with average speeds of 12 to 15
km/hour. The long-term investment plan involves the following components: (i) 2016-19 –
Belgrano rail line (USD 2.5 billion), (ii) 2020-20 – San Martín, Urquiza, and Bahia Blanco-
Añelo rail lines (USD 3.2 billion); (iii) 2024-27 – San Martín and Roca Line freight rail line
extensions (USD 3.2 billion); (iv) 2028-31 – San Martín and Mitre line extensions (USD 3.2
billion) and (v) 2032-35 – Belgrano line extensions (USD 2.8 billion). However, these projects
do not appear to generate sufficient revenues in relation to capital and operating costs to be
financially sustainable with private financing and will likely be developed using public funds.
112. The modernization of the Port of Buenos Aires may be delivered through a PPP
structure. This project is expected to have total capital costs of USD 1.5 billion with
construction taking place over an eight-year period. Proposed improvements by stage include:
(i) Stage 1 – construction of a new bridge, paving, refilling, dredging, and closure of Terminal 6;
(ii) Stage 2 – paving, refilling, new passenger bridge, increased capacity and dredging; (iii) Stage
3 – construction of a new dock, elimination of a grain storage area, and a breakwater extension;
and (iv) Stage 4 – construction of new cruise terminal and dock. The call for tenders is expected
to take place in 2017 or 2018. Private financing could be obtained through a 25-year concession
contract with a 10-year option. The potential 35-year concession represents the longer term
allowable as per the new law.
C.     Water Supply, Irrigation and Sanitation

113. The infrastructure gap in irrigation and water treatment is relatively large. The
penetration rate for wastewater treatment is approximately 15 to 20 percent in Argentina
compared to 70 percent in Brazil and 96 percent in Chile. Similarly, only an estimated 33 percent
of irrigable land has been irrigated. To address this infrastructure deficit, the Ministry of Interior,
Public Works and Housing has proposed an USD 18 billion investment plan to expand plan
water supply through the development of 85,000 km of new water pipelines as well as
improvements to water treatment and distribution facilities. The proposed USD 22 billion
investment for irrigation would involve 45 projects in 15 provinces, which would nearly triple
the amount of irrigated land from 2.1 to 6.2 million hectares.
114. Bids have been received for the Las Catonas-Moreno Wastewater Treatment
project. The brownfield project located in the municipality of Moreno is being tendered by
Enhosa, a water and sewerage utility. The facility is currently not operational and the contract
would involve refurbishment works, which have an estimated capital cost of ARS 247 million
(USD 16 million). Two bids were received. Project financial structure has yet to be determined.
115. Table 12 lists the projects that could be developed and delivered through a PPP. The
financial structure under consideration potentially includes the establishment of special trust
funds or fedeicomisos for administering project revenues and expenses. The pilot PPP project in
Río Negro Province listed in Table 12 could form part of a larger USD 730 million irrigation
project from Valle Azul to Viedma Idevi which includes the construction of a diversion dam, a
14 km canal and secondary & tertiary canals. AySA is also examining potential PPP structures
for electricity and water distribution, but these initiatives remain relatively conceptual.

116. A pilot program for tendering irrigation projects through a PPP is currently being
developed. Four irrigation projects that would supply a total of 122,000 hectares of water have
been identified as potential pilots. The technical evaluation of these 4 pilot projects along with
the pre-feasibility, social and environmental, and institutional framework analyses have been
completed. Current technical assistance support is being provided to: (i) develop the sector
specific legal and regulatory framework for the tendering these pilot through a PPP; (ii) develop
the ownership and governance structure; (iii) developing the potential financial structure; and
(iv) preparing the financial models for these projects. The proposed PPP model will include a
trust (fideicomiso) that will administer the land included under the projects, sell land to farmers,
manage the financial structure, and repay debt.
117. Water supply and wastewater projects that could be delivered through a PPP are
also under consideration. The intent is to tender 3-4 pilots in Catamarca, Salta, and Formosa.
Consultants have been contracted to develop concepts for these pilots. Once these studies have
been completed, feasibility studies will be conducted with respect to determine capital costs,
operating costs, and tariffs.
D.      Health and Education

118. The GoA’s investment plan also attempts to improve health and education facilities .
The proposed investment plan includes USD 16.2 billion to build 460 primary, secondary, and
tertiary education facilities as well as USD 3.9 billion for the construction of new hospitals and
the modernization of existing health centers. The three education projects (with estimated capital
costs of USD 10 million or less) that are considered ready for development include: (i) the
rehabilitation of school buildings in Santiago del Estero; (ii) the construction of a new school in
Cuidad de Plottier; and (iii) the construction of a new school in Rincón de los Sauces. Health
sector projects that could be developed relatively soon are the completion of a hospital in in
Santa Fé City (Santa Fé Province), the construction of a 70-bed hospital and treatment centers in
San Martín de los Andes (Neuquén Province), and the remodeling of a public hospital in Morón

IV.       International Experiences

      119. There are number of different approaches that have been used to encourage the
      development and financing of PPP projects. These include expanding the types of public
      funding and private financing sources as well as developing blended financing structures to
      attempt to crowd-in and expand the participation of the private sector. This section describes
      quality of entry strategies, financing models, and approaches for managing risk and fiscal impact
      that have been adopted and sometimes discarded both in the region and globally.
          A. Prior to Project Tender and Award
      120. The United Kingdom Business Case Model focuses on project selection and quality
      at entry. The U.K. experience with PPPs has led to the development of the five case study model
      for the selection of potential PPPs and provide strategic and economic rationales for developing
      infrastructure projects through PPPs. This model encompasses the following:
         Strategic Case, which highlights the strategic and synergic elements of the proposed project
          and the proposed outcomes;
         Economic Case (or public value), which includes the evaluation of potential project delivery
          options and cost-benefit analysis;
         Commercial Case, which focuses on the successful elements for a PPP transaction, including
          risk transfer, pricing mechanisms, key contract terms, and accounting treatments;
         Financial Case that outlines the funding and financing packages, balance sheet impacts, and
          fiscal impacts; and
         Management Case which demonstrates the project will be implemented in accordance with
          international best practices and includes plans for managing risks, the contracting of advisors,
          implementation monitoring, and contingency arrangements.

      Figure 8: U.K. Stages and Business Case Development and GatewayTM Review Process

      The underlying principle with this approach is that additional resources are expended at project
      development to: (i) avoid inordinate risk assumption, direct guarantees, and contingent liabilities
      by the public sector; (ii) encourage contract standardization; and (iii) avoid project re-tendering
      and contract renegotiations after award. This methodology is an iterative process which focuses

                                                      48
on providing more detailed analysis of the main elements of the business case, e.g. project
design, commercial interest, risk allocation, contract terms, and affordability, at each successive
stage with “gateway? reviews at each stage (Figure 8). Additionally, this process allows for the
review and refinement of underlying assumptions, the assessment and management of potential
dependencies, and a framework for project monitoring oversight over time. Partnerships UK
anticipates this approaches places greater emphasis on the estimation of lifecycle costs during the
project term, the potential value to the public sector, improved due diligence and the quality of
procurements, increased competition, and more efficient financing approaches.
    B. Prior to Close of Finance
          i.          Bank Loans

121. Although bank loans comprised about 70 percent of total financing for PPP and
project finance transactions in 2015, financing from project bonds has rebounded since the
2008-09 global recession. Using data provided by Infrastructure Journal, bond financing as a
percentage of total non-public financing for infrastructure averaged approximately 6 percent
from 2006 to 2015. Prior to the 2008-09 recession, bond financing accounted for roughly 8
percent of the total financing for infrastructure, decreasing significantly to 2 percent during the
recession. During this period, there were relatively few bond issues for infrastructure, which was
due in part to the collapse of the monoline insurers who had previously provided credit
guarantees on such bonds, but who had large exposures in the housing and real estate markets.

         ii.          Public Financing
122. Financing through bonds accounted for approximately 9 percent of total
infrastructure financing in 2015. Lending from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) was
relatively small at approximately 2 percent of total financing for infrastructure in 2006,
increasing significantly to 7 percent during the recession, peaking to 16 percent in 2013, and then
decreasing to 8 percent in 2015. Financing from bank loans for project finance transactions has
decreased steadily from 77 percent of in 2006 to approximately 67 percent in 2015. Finally,

                                                        49
equity investment has accounted for 13 to 15 percent of total infrastructure financing except
during the recession years, during which time lenders required additional equity commitments to
achieve close of finance.
123. In the United States, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
(TIFIA) loans are direct government lending programs that provide cheaper financing for
project finance transactions. The TIFIA program's fundamental goal is to leverage Federal
funds by attracting substantial private and other non-Federal co-investment for critical
improvements to the national surface transportation system. Because TIFIA credit assistance is
often available on more advantageous terms than in the financial markets, this program has
become an important component for financing PPPs in the U.S. As of April 2017, interest rates
on TIFIA loans were 3 percent. The TIFIA credit program offers three distinct types of financial
assistance designed to address the varying requirements of projects throughout their life cycles:
      Secured (direct) loans which offers flexible repayment terms, a 5-year grace period during
       construction, and up to 35 year maturities. The grace period is intended to allow for sufficient
       time to complete completion and a partial revenue service ramp-up period.
      Loan guarantees through the full-faith-and-credit of the U.S. Government, which guarantees
       borrower repayments to non-Federal lenders.
      Standby lines of credit which represents a secondary source of funding in the form of a
       contingent Federal loan to supplement project revenues, if needed, during the first 10 years of
       project operations, available up to 10 years after substantial completion of project.
Funding amounts are capped based on Congressional appropriations. TIFIA credit assistance is
limited to a maximum of 33 percent of the total eligible project costs and the senior debt must be
rated investment grade. Projects receiving TIFIA loans must be supported in whole or in part
from user charges or other non-Federal dedicated funding sources. As a result, the private sector
typically takes on revenue risk in these transactions. The TIFIA loan program is extremely
competitive and there is a formal pre-application project review to screen out non-bankable
project and a formal application. The overall program currently consists of 56 active loans and
10 retired loans. Due to lower than forecasted revenues, four projects have required a
restructuring of the non-TIFIA loans and another project was effectively in default on the TIFIA
loans.
124. In Europe, the European Investment Bank and the European Commission set up
the Loan Guarantee for Trans-European Transport (LGTT) program to attract a larger
private sector participation in the financing of transport projects. The LGTT guarantee
enables the transfer of demand risk in a concession-based PPP project during the early years of
operation thereby significantly improving the financial viability of the project and making the
capital structure more robust. By providing the guarantee, the EIB is effectively assuming
revenue risk by becoming a mezzanine lender to the project. The flexibility of the LGTT
structure permits a tailoring of the product to fit the needs of the project. The product fits
optimally with state-guaranteed senior debt and is an excellent element in mini-perm20 structures.
The EIB and the EC have each committed capital of EUR 500 million to enable LGTT of around
EUR 5 billion to be issued from 2008 to 2013. The instrument was launched in 2008 and during


20
     Bridge financing between the end of construction phase and project revenue earning phase.

                                                          50
its first full year of operation in 2009 it was it was used for three PPP road projects that reached
financial close with a total guarantee amount of EUR 70 million.
       iii.         Project Bonds
125. The Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region illustrates the varying degree
that project bonds can be used to finance infrastructure. Brazil has financed nearly all of its
infrastructure projects during the last five years through loans from the Brazilian Development
Bank (BNDES) and other DFIs. At the other end of the spectrum Chile, in general, does not use
DFI financing for its infrastructure program. Moreover, the extent that bank loans are used to
finance bank loans is relatively high in Chile and Colombia while somewhat low in Peru.
Mexico, Chile, and Peru have used capital market instruments to finance infrastructure at higher
rates than the global average. However, the models used to support bond financing in Colombia
and Peru are relatively different with differing implications on long-term sustainability, risk
allocation, and fiscal impact.

126. In Colombia, Pacifico Tres and Costanera Norte were the first two Fourth
Generation (4G) highway projects that obtained financing through project bonds in both
local and hard currencies. These 144A dollar-denominated bonds were listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange during 2016. These projects present several innovative features:
    They are greenfield projects with majority debt financing raised from pension funds,
     through either project bonds or debt funds. The Pacifico Tres project attracted 73 percent of
     total debt from the capital markets. This amount was 62 percent for the Costanera Norte
     project.
    They are examples of a hybrid project financing model that is gaining increasing popularity,
     mixing bank loans at shorter maturities (12 years) and debt fund loans and project bonds
     with longer maturities (19 years).
    A partial financial guarantee covering all debt was necessary to match the market risk
     appetite.

                                                51
      International investors participated in both the U.S. dollar-denominated bond as well as the
       local currency bond.
      Voting on control issues by bond holders follow a “deemed approval process.? which is
       increasingly used in the LAC region.

127. The project loans and bonds in U.S. dollars and Colombian pesos (COP) obtained
the same investment grade in the global rating scale (BBB- on the global scale from Fitch
Ratings) and national scale ratings (AA+). Such high ratings were made possible by several
features: fixed-price; date-certain engineering/procurement/construction (EPC) contracts; low
exposure to revenue risks due to government availability payments; and a Colombian-peso
denominated revolving Subordinated Multipurpose Facility (SMF) equal to 15 percent of
outstanding senior debt. The SMF mitigates liquidity/budgetary risks, construction delays, and
temporary liquidity due to low traffic performance. The bonds also featured strong structural
features including multiple reserve accounts and a cash sweep mechanism. All debts are fully
amortizing and senior secured. The SMF is provided by Financiera de Desarrollo Nacional
(FDN), a quasi-public infrastructure finance bank.
128. Given the unfamiliarity of Colombian institutional investors with infrastructure
project finance and the lack of experience with the new 4G concession model, the SMF
played a critical role in helping investors become comfortable with these projects. Tolls on
the completed roads are annually adjusted at the beginning of the year by the change in the
inflation rate. Should the net present value of toll collections received by the 8th, 13th, 18th, and
the last year of the concession fall below guaranteed values, the national infrastructure agency,
ANI, has the obligation to cover any shortfalls, after deductions for failure to meet availability,
service level, or quality standards specified in the concession agreement. Deductions are capped
at 10 percent. The U.S. dollar-denominated bonds have matched U.S. dollar-linked currency
revenues (provided by the government of Colombia) settled in COP and issued at a fixed rate. In
this manner, bond holders are not exposed to exchange rate risks. The COP-denominated bond
payments are indexed to inflation using as a reference rate.

129. The financing scheme for PPP projects in Peru has been based on the use of
unconditional and irrevocable payment obligations on the part of the government to
remunerate the investment of the concessionaires. The concessionaire has used these
availability payment obligations, known as Compensation for Investments (RPIs 21), to finance

21
     Retribución por Inversiones.

                                                       52
infrastructure projects in the capital markets. The RPIs are linked to the Certificados de Advance
de Obra ("CAOs") that originate according to the milestones in the construction of infrastructure.
The CAO/RPI promises of consistent government funding can be securitized which allows the
concessionaire to issue bonds ex ante, backed by the government commitment. However, CAOs
are not associated with the achievement of outcome based milestones or Key Performance
Indicators (KPI) that guarantee the entry into service operations of the infrastructure assets.

130. Because payment is delinked from concessionaire performance, the RPI based
system does not fully transfer project risk to the private sector, since the underlying credit
risk is close to the sovereign risk of the Peruvian State. The project is, in practice, financed at
a higher cost of capital through a PPP structure but retains the risk profile of a project procured
through traditional public procurement methods. RPI payments are rated as sovereign debt and
thus have an impact on government borrowing limits. The situation has been compounded by the
frequent renegotiation of PPP contracts, particularly those tendered through unsolicited proposals
and/or were underbid by the winning contactor.

131. PPP projects in Peru for electricity generation provide an illustrative example.
Electricity projects were initially mostly self-sustaining, but have been turned into projects
requiring availability payments that are often paid from the start of construction. In addition to
the co-financing commitments, the Government of Peru offered explicit guarantees and assumed
contingent liabilities implicit in the various PPP contracts. In addition, the Government of Peru is
taking risks (such as geotechnical and environmental) that are sometimes partially taken by the
private sector.

132. Over the last two years, Peru has been undertaking reforms to the PPP framework
that are intend to improve the level of risks transferred to the private sector. This includes
the enactment of a PPP Law and the development of a regulatory framework based on the UK
Green Book. This includes changes in how project are developed, increased due diligence,
financial structuring, and the development of a model PPP contract. The Government of Peru is
still in the process of implementing the revised PPP framework. The response of the new
framework has been mixed. While potential lenders and institutional investors appreciate the
increased level of due diligence and improved risk allocation, contractors operating in the
Peruvian market have been reluctant to embrace changes to the PPP framework.

133. Brazil is exploring the development a Standardized Infrastructure Bonds (SDIB)
model to help mobilize private sector financing of infrastructure projects on a larger scale.
The concept developed jointly between the Government of Brazil and the World Bank has
received encouraging feedback from private and public sector stakeholders and is ready to be
tested in future PPP infrastructure concessions. The SDIB is a fixed income security issued by a
concessionary company. It brings the following innovations:
   The payment of interest during the construction period. SDIB investors will start receiving
    interest payments from the first semester of the bond. The interest is payable during the life
    of the bond as any other corporate or sovereign instrument. An underlying guarantee
    mechanism is in place and kicks in if the interest payments require a third-party source to be
    honored.


                                                53
    There is a guarantee on the bond principal at the end of the construction period and/or at
     bond maturity. Using a Brady bond structure22, private guarantors of SDIB, will raise capital
     to set aside collateral to cover the contingent guarantee, by investing in Brazilian Treasury
     bonds that will have a value equivalent up to 100 percent of principal at the end of
     construction period. The development bank, BNDES would contribute a share of such
     collateral/capital sourced from a proposed World Bank loan, with a long-term repayment
     period. Thus, the cost of the guarantee facility with BNDES’ contribution to the seed capital,
     should attract private financial investors to structure such funds.

134. Interest payments during construction alleviate concerns regarding construction
risk.23 The SDIB provides high quality guarantees (treasury bonds) that can be easily valued and
understood by any investor. The risk sharing structure effectively passes risks to private sector
institutions. Institutional investors have partial or total guarantees on the principal at the end of
the construction period, and interest is protected during the construction phase; however, they
assume all risks in the next phase. The financing of interest during the construction period and
the provision of partial or total guarantees on the principal can potentially help to promote the
catalytic role of the BNDES and facilitate the participation of other banks in the structuring

22
   Brady bonds were created in March 1989 to convert bank loans to mostly Latin American countries into a “menu?
of new bonds after many of those countries defaulted on their debt during the 1980s. At the time, the market for
emerging markets' sovereign debt was small and illiquid. This key innovation was to provide a “menu of options?
that accompanied these new bonds, which allowed commercial banks to exchange their existing claims on
developing countries into tradable bonds which had U.S. treasury securities as underlying collateral.

   The J curve refers to investments, typically in infrastructure, where the first phase (e.g., construction) is loss
making, i.e., investment value is negative first, before picking up in latter phases and achieving positive returns. In
the presence of high interest rates, such as in Brazil, the presence of a “J curve? is a significant inhibiting factor for
the participation of institutional investors.

business, thereby creating the sufficient conditions for market surveillance and risk pricing. The
guarantee backed by allocated government bond securities has the potential to expand the pool of
private sector capital that could offer credit enhancement to infrastructure bonds. The guarantee
is based on a AAA rated asset on the local scale that is ring-fenced and easily exercisable, so that
the rating of the project bond is separate from the credit rating of the guarantor. In practice, any
entity or investor willing to deposit government bonds in a guarantee fund could participate in
the structure as a fee earning guarantor.
         iv.      Pension Funds
135. Australia and Canada are two leaders in pension fund investment in infrastructure.
Australian and Canadian pension funds have invested in infrastructure since the early 1990s and
early 2000s, respectively. Asset allocation by pension funds dedicated to infrastructure is
approximately 5 percent in these two countries, which is the highest in the world. In comparison,
the global average is roughly 1 percent.
136. Canada’s infrastructure plan is similarly ambitious. Despite closing a few projects
in the early 1990s, Canada has generally lagged behind the United Kingdom and Australia
in the development of PPPs. This situation changed starting in 2006 with the launch of a C$33
billion infrastructure plan, Building Canada, and was further catalyzed with the launch of the
C$53 billion New Building Canada Plan in 2013. Despite being active in PPP programs,
Canadian banks have tended to be more conservative with respect to infrastructure lending with
fewer loans and shorter maturities e.g. 5 to 7 years. The banking sector is complemented by one
of the more developed project bond markets globally along with the strong participation of
institutional investors, including pension funds and insurance companies.
137. Canadian pension funds are major players globally and locally in investing in
infrastructure. Eight Canadian pension funds are among the 100th largest in the world and
account for 15 percent of all assets in the Canadian financial system. A key factor in the
growth of pension funds has been the strong interest in non-liquid assets, such as real estate and
infrastructure both domestically and internationally. Canadian pension funds have annual
contributions of USD 4 to USD 5 billion per year. An important characteristic regarding
Canadian pension funds is that the funds are mostly unregulated with the only regulation
involving payments to beneficiaries. Additionally, Canadian pension funds have been using
cheap debt capital to fund investments.
138. Canadian pension funds also have relatively low overhead costs along with high
internal capacity. Notable infrastructure investments within Canada include the Toronto 407
Express Toll Route (CPPIB pension investment board), inTransitBC (bcIMC, CDPQ), and the
Bruce Nuclear Power Plant (OMERS). Globally, Canadian pension funds have invested in Grupo
SAESA which is Chile’s second largest electricity and distribution company (PSP Investments,
bcIMC, and CPPIB), Eurostar (CDPQ pension fund), toll road projects in India (CPPIB) and
Porterbrook Rail in the U.K. (AIMCo).24 The estimated USD 159.2 billion in infrastructure and
real estate investments represent 14.5 percent of total Assets Under Management (AUM).

139. Australia’s Future Fund is an example of a non-commodity based sovereign wealth
fund (SWF). The Future Fund is an independently managed investment fund into which
the Government of Australia deposits its budget surplus. The purpose of the fund is to cover
the future payments due to public employees during retirement. The Future Fund operates as an
umbrella entity responsible for five other funds: (i) the Building Australia Fund that finances
major infrastructure projects (e.g. road, rail, ports, and broadband), valued at AUS 3.7 billion;26
(ii) Health and Hospitals Fund, valued at AUS 459 million; (iii) Education Investment Fund,
valued at AUS 3.7 billion; (iv) Disability Care Australia Fund, valued at A$6.1 billion; and (v)
Medical Research Fund, valued at AUS 3.2 billion. The fund is managed and overseen by a 7-
member independent board of guardians with 5-year, overlapping terms. The fund was initially
seeded through the privatization of the nationalized telecommunications company, Telstra. Since
its establishment, the fund’s AUM has increased from AUS 59.62 in 2008 to AUD 139.5 in
2016.
140. In Colombia, closed-end mutual funds have grown from a $900 million industry in
2010 to $13 billion at the end of 2016. Although a few closed-end mutual funds were
operational in Colombia prior to 2010, availability and investor appetite for these instruments

increased significantly due to legislation enacted in 2010 and 2013. The recent expansion of the
mutual fund industry has been aided by the enactment of legislative decrees #1242 and #1243 in
2013 which allowed mutual fund managers to delegate investment decisions and risk
management to external managers. This change in regulation has helped to encourage new
market entrants, particularly outside of Colombia, to establish open and closed-end funds. Unlike
open ended funds which are priced once per day, closed-end funds are traded and priced
throughout the day like a corporate stock. Thus, closed-end funds tend to be relatively more liquid.
However, closed-end funds limit the investment period and have a more limited duration period.
Table 15 lists selected examples of closed-end funds in Colombia that have traded, are trading or
in the process of raising funds to invest in infrastructure. Some of these funds operate in multiple
countries in the region.

        v.       Value Capture Initiatives
141. Colombia is also cited as a success story with respect to value capture strategies.
Betterment taxes (known in Colombia as contribución de valorización) have been in place since
1921 and have been assessed in Bogota, Cali, and Medellin. These special tax assessments are
levied when a project is initiated within in a city area to increase property values and grow the
                                                    57
property tax base. These special assessments, which can account for up to 25 percent of local
government revenues, can be used to directly finance ongoing or future infrastructure costs,
and/or can be secured as collateral for the issuance of bonds. These fees have mostly been used
to cover capital and operational costs.
142. The FIBRA model in Mexico, which are like Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT),
is designed to encourage investment in real estate assets. The FIBRA model was launched in
2011. In accordance with Mexican law, a FIBRA must be established as a trust pursuant to a
Mexican law-governed trust agreement. The main purpose of the FIBRA trust is to acquire or
construct real estate properties that are destined for lease or to purchase the right to obtain
income from the lease of such real estate properties. Shares of FIBRAs are publicly traded on the
Mexican stock exchange. FIBRAs pay dividends on the collected rents.
143. Specific financial and contractual conditions relating to FIBRAs include the
following: (i) at least 70 percent of the trust estate of the FIBRA must be invested in real estate
properties in Mexico and the remainder must be invested in either securities issued by the
Mexican Federal government or in shares issued by mutual funds; (ii) properties developed by
the FIBRA must be leased and may not be sold within four years of completing construction; (iii)
the FIBRA must distribute to its real estate trust certificates (CBFI) holders at least once a year,
and no later than March 15 of each year, at least 95 percent of the net of tax result accrued during
the immediately preceding year; (iv) the trustee of a FIBRA must issue certificates to represent
the trust estate and these certificates must be publicly offered. FIBRAs offer significant tax
advantages, including the deferral of income tax of up to 5 percent of the taxable profits on the
activity, and the elimination of dividend tax on distributions.
144. Although the FIBRA model has been used to invest in hotels, industrial zones, and
office buildings, FIBRAs can also be used to finance the infrastructure adjacent to these
facilities. In 2015, the Government of Mexico established the regulations for the FIBRA-E
structures, which will be dedicated toward the development of one or more of the following
activities: (i) electricity generation, transmission, and distribution facilities; (ii) roads, highways,
railways, and bridges; (iii) port and port facilities; (iv) civilian airfields; (v) public drinking
water, drainage, sewerage, and wastewater treatment facilities; (vi) telecommunications.27
Supplemental regulations were enacted in April 2016. FIBRA-E structures provide similar tax
benefits. However, no FIBRA-E structures have been listed on the Mexican stock exchange, as
of this writing.
145. In five years, FIBRAs have grown from one firm with a market value of USD 300
million to ten companies with a total estimated market value of USD 18 billion . However,
the value of FIBRAs are indirectly tied to macroeconomic conditions in the Mexican and the
market for U.S. REITs. Due to prevailing conditions, FIBRAs have lost approximately 20
percent of value from 2014 to 2015. Incentive misalignments and liquidity have been the biggest
concerns for institutional investors.
C.      After Close of Finance – Contingent Liabilities


27
    FIBRA-E structures are related to Development Trusts (“CKDs? in Spanish), which can be used for broader
activities including infrastructure, real estate, mining, technology, and general business activities.


                                                    58
146. A few countries have developed comprehensive frameworks for managing
contingent liabilities in PPPs. This can take the form of specific national PPP legislation,
regulation, or the adoption of international legislation in the case of the European Union
countries. In Australia, guidelines set conditions under which the government can provide
guarantees or incur contingent liabilities, including the requirement that risks are explicitly
identified, and expected benefits outweigh the level and cost of risks. Guidelines requiring
similar justifications for guarantees and contingent liabilities are followed in Canada.
147. In Colombia, the framework for managing contingent liabilities has been codified in
a series of laws and decrees, which includes the creation of Contingent Liability Fund .
Beginning with Law #448 in 1998 which addressed the issue of provisioning for the contingent
liabilities and the creation of a Contingent Liability Fund a year after the law was passed. The
National Planning Department estimated that total contingent liabilities of the government —not
limited to PPPs but including legal risks, natural disasters, pension liabilities, and others—had
reached 154.11 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).28 Subsequent legislation in 2003,
2007, 2012, defined conditions for budgetary responsibility and transparency, the definitions of
contingent liabilities, disclosure requirements, and extensions of contracts.
148. Minimum revenue guarantees in Chile have helped attract private capital and are
capped so that the Government does not have unlimited demand exposures. Most of the
road and airport concessions in Chile contain revenue guarantees. Minimum revenue guarantees
are capped at 70 percent of private investment, plus operations and maintenance costs. However,
if actual revenues are higher than forecast, then the public sector can share in the profits from the
facility. Thus, the traffic risk is shared, the government guarantee is not unlimited, and excessive
losses to the private sector are avoided. Although the revenue guarantees are not legally tied to
the concessionaire’s borrowing, they do facilitate access to private capital.
149. The Ministry of Finance in Chile has taken on more of an active involvement during
the procurement process and has a strong reporting framework. Although the Ministry of
Public Works (MOP) takes the lead in designing, awarding, and monitoring concessions, the
Ministry of Finance is involved in the design of the concession contract, contract award, and any
renegotiations of the contract. The Ministry of Finance is represented on the selection committee
that evaluates the tender and must also approve the contract with the private sector. The Ministry
of Finance’s role continues after the concession has been awarded as the Minister of Finance
must sign any supreme decree that formalizes a change in the concession contract.
150. The Ministry of Finance must also approve any agreement between the
concessionaire and the MOP in the event of a contract dispute. In addition to using IMF
reporting guidelines for direct and indirect guarantees, the Government of Chile also prepares
annual reports on: (i) the public finance impact of PPPs which estimates the net present value of
committed guarantees, subsidies, and availability payments against the government’s available
fiscal space; and (ii) a contingent liabilities report, which uses quantitative methods to estimate

V.      Strategies for Supporting Capital Market Financing of Infrastructure

     152. The financing of infrastructure should build on existing initiatives and programs.
     Potential support with respect to capital market financing of infrastructure, PPPs, and project
     finance transactions could involve the following areas: (i) expanding the types and durations of
     capital markets instruments that can be used to finance infrastructure; (ii) replicating the FODER
     model to support a general infrastructure fund; and (iii) technical assistance for the PPP program.
        A. Expanding Capital Market Instruments
     153. Technical assistance should be considered for the expansion and deepening capital
     market activities. The diagnostic of capital market activities along with the overview of
     international best practices outlined a several areas that can potentially expand the types of
     capital market instruments used to finance infrastructure. These reforms can potentially be
     achieved through a review of market barriers as well as the development of possible
     modifications to the legal and regulatory framework to address these issues. Potential activities
     include the following:
           i.   Encourage insurance companies to offer new types of products;
          ii.   Rebuild the private systems by incentivizing the establishment of asset management
                companies for managing pension assets;
         iii.   Provide preferential tax treatment for closed-end mutual funds or value capture
                adjacent to real estate;
         iv.    Support the establishment of REITs;
          v.    Review the governance structure, mission, and investment strategy of the FGS;
         vi.    Promote the issuance of peso-linked bonds while developing a peso/dollar hedge
                market.
         vii.   Expand the use of special purpose trusts, such as FODER, to provide financial
                support and credit risk enhancements in case PPP projects experience temporary
                financial pressures.
        viii.   Examine “value capture? strategies based on increasing tax revenues from land
                adjacent to infrastructure assets, as complementary financing sources;
         ix.    Analyze how sector-based funds with dedicated tax revenues (e.g.: gas taxes, for road
                financing) can be used as collateral to secure bond issues.
          x.    Enhance the private placement (144(k)) style regime to better incorporate project
                bonds for sale to qualified investors.
        B. Guarantee Facilities
     154. The FODER model provides guarantee support to renewable energy generation,
     which can only be called in limited circumstances as a last resort. FODER guarantees will
     cover three types of payment obligations: (i) ongoing payment obligations of CAMMESA for
     purchasing energy under the PPAs, (ii) government payment obligations emerging from the
     option to purchase eligible sub-projects, and (iii) government payment obligations emerging

                                                     61
from the right of IPPs to sell their sub-projects to FODER (i.e. to exercise a Put Option) if
specific macroeconomic or sector risks materialize. To mitigate risks expressed by private
investors, GoA also requested that the guarantee facility backstop certain Put Option payments
that can be triggered by the following events of default: (a) extended non-payment by the off-
taker under the PPA, (b) inconvertibility, (c) intransferability, (d) material adverse changes to
FODER’s operations without the subproject’s prior consent, and (e) non-compliance with an
arbitral award or judgment.
155. Options should be explored for modifying or expanding partial credit guarantee
facilities (as used for RenovAR) to include other infrastructure sectors or support sub-
sovereign entities in their respective PPP programs. Article 9 (q) of the new PPP Law permits
the Government of Argentina to provide credit guarantees and to use revenues generated from a
PPP projects as security. A similar structure as the RenovAR credit enhancement can be
developed for other infrastructure sectors, such as road surface transport, irrigation, or water
supply, extended to sub-sovereign entities, or involve additional guarantee components not
included in the RenovAR program. Partial credit guarantees can be sector specific or multi-sector
depending on project readiness and demand factors.
156. Given the GoA’s sectoral priorities as documented in this report and its limited
fiscal space, the implementation of financial mechanisms supported by the PPP law will be
key to the success of the PPP program. At the same time, the Government’s keenness on
deepening the capital markets means that instruments to attract bond investors to infrastructure
projects (both brownfield and greenfield) need special efforts to optimize their design and offer
coverage for critical investor risks. While bond investors typically complement rather than
substitute for bank and sponsor financing of infrastructure, new products are being considered to
bring bond investors more upstream in the process. Specialized credit enhancement instruments
should thus be in place as pipeline projects materialize and following the awarding of tenders,
financial closing can be expedited.
157. In the above context, innovative infrastructure financing and guarantee mechanisms
that can be developed considering useful credit enhancement design options to attract both
capital market and other investors30, may include the following:
    Use of contingent credit lines as stand-by liquidity and/or credit enhancement facilities.

    First loss partial credit guarantees (e.g., up to 20 percent) backed by multilateral institutions,
     the GoA, BICE, state-owned banks, and/or private banks. Some of the large state owned
     commercial banks are interested in participating in partial credit guarantee facilities and their
     large capital and liquidity base may also help leverage other investors.

    First loss “contract payment? guarantees, for example, from the GoA to the sponsor, or from
     the sponsor to the contractor for specified risks affecting project cash flows.


30
   Bond investors and credit rating agencies typically prefer outright credit risk guarantees which are easier to price.
Other financiers or sponsors, may consider taking contractual risks, e.g. timely land purchase, right-of-way
acquisition, revenue risk, or geological risks if these risks can be properly priced and managed. Project
enhancements and guarantee mechanisms are often incorporated into the PPP contract as a means of sharing these
risks with the public sector. However, capital market participants are unwilling to directly assumes these risks.

                                                          62
   Use of a financial intermediary to insure or guarantee infrastructure bonds, especially to
    cover interest payments during construction or bond principal default. This would address
    the “J curve? pattern of infrastructure project cash flows. Such structures including private
    capital could count on multilateral guarantees channeled via a domestic development bank or
    a special trust therein, or use long term contingent multilateral credit to help capitalize an
    Argentine guarantee fund (with private or mixed participation).

   Use of contingent credit lines as a guarantee backstop facility for a domestic development
    bank to provide limited first loss coverage (e.g., up to 20% per project) to project financiers
    (banks or bondholders).

   Set up a stand-alone infrastructure fund to issue debt backstopped by a 20-30 percent credit
    guarantee limit for first losses.

   Raise funding from diversified investors to create an investment fund to provide early
    financing for a set of infrastructure projects, and whose capital can be increased by
    subscription of additional equity shares.

   Securitize promised government availability payments to raise bond funding at the outset,
    and include a third party guarantee to cover payments to bondholders if availability payments
    are not disbursed due to the concessionaire/sponsor not meeting project milestone outputs.

158. In the context of the above instruments, MoF should also put in place monitoring systems
and methodologies to track its contingent liabilities (for those instruments that imply government
exposure) to assess it contingent indebtedness.
    C. Legal, Regulatory and Institutional Reforms
159. The following technical advisory areas should be considered to provide a more
supportive and conducive business environment for expanding and deepening capital
market activities, especially for infrastructure finance:
i. Capital Markets Law. Provisions could be added or new legislation, regulation or policies
   could be developed that would: (i) encourage insurance companies to offer new types of
   products; (ii) rebuild private pension systems by incentivizing the establishment of asset
   management companies; (iii) providing preferential tax treatment for closed end mutual
   funds; (iv) supporting the establishment of REITs; (v) reviewing the governance structure,
   mission, and investment strategy of the FGS; (vi) encourage the development of long-term
   hedging instruments to manage currency risk; and (viii) incentivize the issuance of local
   currency bonds and project bonds while developing a peso/dollar hedge market.
ii. Refine the Regulatory Framework of PPPs. An initial set of regulations were drafted and
    issued in March 2017 in support of the new PPP law. Additional international expertise
    should be deployed in the drafting of the subsequent iterations of the regulatory framework.
    It is recommended that specific regulatory guidelines also be developed with respect to the
    following topics: (1) unsolicited proposals; (2) information disclosure, and (3) sub-sovereign
    entities.


                                                63
iii. Support the implementation of the normative framework for PPP. This can include
     developing the guidelines and operational procedures.
iv. Institutional Structure. The GoA needs to define the institutional structure of the new PPP
    unit as well as the governance structure, roles and responsibilities, operational procedures for
    the PPP unit.
v. PPP Project Pipeline. Support should be considered for the development and implementation
   of an analytical framework for evaluating, selecting and prioritizing potentially bankable
   PPPs across multiple sectors.
vi. Market Sounding. The GoA should conduct market sounding activities to gauge the interest
    of contractors, infrastructure operators, and financial institutions to invest and lend to PPP
    programs and projects.
160. Clarifying the regulatory framework regarding PPP to encourage similar programs
at the sub-sovereign level. There has been interest by the Province of Buenos Aires, the
Province of Cordoba, and the Municipality of Buenos Aires to develop PPP program for local
infrastructure projects.

Executive Summary

This project provides novel empirical evidence on the impact of technology on tax compliance costs
and tax behavior of firms by examining the adoption and subsequent impact of electronic tax filing
(e-filing) on small and medium enterprises in Tajikistan. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
randomized experiment on this topic.

In this context, electronic filing allows taxpayers to submit their tax declarations online instead of in-
person at the tax office thereby eliminating the need for time-consuming visits to the tax office and
frequent interactions with tax officials (and the potential unofficial behaviors that may arise from
these interactions).

The study sample of 1498 small and medium enterprises was drawn from firms registered at the tax
authority. Firms were randomly assigned to receive two types of interventions designed to encourage
e-filing adoption and compared to a control group that did not receive the interventions. The first
treatment group received information and training on e-filing, and logistical help to complete all the
steps required for e-filing registration. The second group received only information and training on
e-filing.

The results indicate that the e-filing training coupled with logistical help with registration is highly
successful at promoting e-filing adoption as 93 percent of firms in this group adopt e-filing. In
contrast, the e-filing training alone does not produce an effect with any significant difference from the
control group treatment (63 percent adoption, compared with 59 percent in the control group). This
finding that helping firms register for e-filing has such a substantial effect, compared to only
informing them of the benefits of e-filing and providing them with in-depth training, suggests that
hassle costs may serve as an important barrier in accessing government services. Further, the results
indicate that firms with above-median risk of evading taxes (as measured by the risk index developed
by the Tax Committee) were less likely to sign up for e-filing. There were no significant differences in
e-filing adoption between male-owned and female-owned firms.

In addition, this report examines the impact of e-filing on firms that adopt it as a result of the
intervention. As expected, e-filing reduces time spent by firms in complying with tax obligations.
Firms save about five hours on average every month, about 15 percent of the total amount of time
spent on tax-related activities. The analysis reveals that the benefits in terms of time saved by firms
more than covered the costs of providing logistical help to register within seven months. Firms that
e-file have fewer in-person interactions with tax authorities and are less likely to experience coercion
from tax officials on certain measures. No significant impacts were found on the average amount of
tax paid by firms but this masks significant differences across firms‚Äîe-filing increases the amount of
tax paid by firms with above-median risk score and closes the revenue gap between firms with above-
median risk and those with below-median risk. Lastly, once firms begin to e-file, they become more
likely to adopt other technology such as electronic accounting records, online banking and use of
email. Given that these other technologies may increase productivity of the firm, this effect may be a
potential channel for long term impact on firm performance.

1.   Introduction and Background

Across the world, different sectors of government are embracing the use of information technology
in delivering services and interacting with citizens. While improving service delivery and efficiency is
typically a central motivation of these e-government initiatives, increasing compliance is often an
important consequence. Technological innovations can provide systems that are difficult for human
agents to interfere with and thus reduce the occurrence of unauthorized behavior. In addition,
technology systems can make available at low cost a tremendous amount of data that can be used for
monitoring compliance behavior. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the
impact of technology on governance by examining the introduction of electronic tax filing in
Tajikistan.

Electronic tax filing was introduced in Tajikistan in 2012 as part of a broader reform package of the
Central Asia Tax Administration Project. Through this project, the IFC provided support to the Tax
Committee of Tajikistan and stakeholders from the business community in crafting a new tax code
that went into effect on January 1, 2013. The new code contains a number of reforms aimed at
reducing compliance costs for businesses and stimulating business formalization and growth.

The Tax Committee had a number of reasons for introducing e-filing. First, it sought to reduce tax
compliance costs faced by firms. Most firms have monthly filing obligations for five categories of taxes
(social tax, personal income tax, corporate income tax, road users‚Äô tax and value added tax). In the
absence of e-filing, firms submit their tax declarations in person at local tax offices with otherwise
productive time spent waiting in line for multiple checks and signatures. On average, firms in the
study sample (with a median of two employees) report spending 33 hours each month on fulfilling
their tax obligations, with about three hours going towards the monthly visits to the tax office. The
second goal of e-filing was to reduce the frequency of interactions between taxpayers and tax officials
in order to reduce the occurrence of unofficial behaviors that may arise during those interactions. The
World Bank Enterprise Survey 2013 reports that 32 percent of firms expect to give gifts in meetings
with tax officials and 37 percent expect to give gifts to any public officials to ‚Äúget things done.''

 By making it easier for people to file and pay taxes, and by closing off opportunities for unofficial
interactions, the government expects that e-filing will ultimately lead to increased voluntary
compliance and thus increased tax revenues. Other motives for introducing e-filing are to improve
the availability and quality of tax records by reducing the mistakes made by clerks with large data
entry burdens; and improving the efficiency of tax administration by releasing officials from routine
work to focus on higher value activities.

After its introduction in 2012, adoption of e-filing by firms was slower than expected and only about
30 percent of firms had registered for e-filing at the time this project began. Given the anticipated
benefits from adoption, there was significant interest in understanding the constraints to adoption
and potential ways of addressing them. Focus group meetings and interviews with business owners
as well as Tax Committee officials indicated that firms were not using e-filing for a variety of reasons,
including: lack of awareness of e-filing, lack of trust in the reliability of the e-filing system, difficulties



                                                                                                             6
in the registration process, lack of computers and internet access, and lastly, some firms simply
preferred to deal directly with the same tax inspector on a regular basis rather than e-file.

The Tax Committee in partnership with the World Bank Group decided to conduct an impact
evaluation to assess the effect of two sets of encouragements designed to promote e-filing adoption
among firms: (i) information and training on e-filing to overcome the lack of awareness and trust, and
(ii) logistical help with registering for e-filing to address the challenges firms faced in the registration
process. Importantly, the logistical support could also serve as a nudge to firms that would otherwise
postpone the adoption of e-filing. In parallel, the Tax Committee implemented a number of additional
reforms to increase e-filing adoption including eliminating the fees firms initially had to pay for
registration and an e-token, conducting information campaigns and providing e-terminals for firms
that lacked internet access.



2.        Impact Evaluation Methodology

    2.1. Research Questions
This study evaluates two broad sets of questions. The first set of questions examines the decisions of
firms to adopt e-filing:

   i.       What is the impact of providing information and training about e-filing on adoption?
  ii.       What is the additional impact of helping firms to register?
 iii.       What other firm characteristics predict e-filing adoption?

The second set of questions examines the impact of e-filing:

     i.     What is the impact of e-filing on firms, particularly their compliance costs, tax behavior and
            productivity?

    2.2. Impact Evaluation Design and Implementation
Firms were randomly assigned into two treatment groups and one control group designed to address
the identified constraints. In the intensive treatment arm (Group A), firms received an e-filing training
session in which they learned about e-filing availability, its benefits, and registration procedures. The
training also included an interactive demonstration of the e-filing system. In addition, these firms
received logistical support in registering for e-filing: a representative of the implementing partner
contacted the firms and helped them complete all the steps required for registration.

Firms in the second treatment arm (Group B) received an identical e-filing training session but they
did not receive the logistical help for registration. In the control group (Group C), firms did not receive
e-filing training. However, to keep constant the delivery format of the treatments, these firms also
received a general training on taxation that was not specific to e-filing. Rather, the training included
a review of different tax laws and procedures. Due to a requirement by the Tax Committee, this




                                                                                                          7
general tax training included one statement about the availability of e-filing on a slide that listed the
three modes of filing taxes: ‚Äúby paper, by mail and electronically.‚Äù1

This impact evaluation is a randomized control trial, as this method enables us to verify that any
changes observed are due to the interventions offered. Indeed, the random allocation of firms to
treatment and control groups ensures that firms in different groups have on average the same
characteristics prior to program implementation (and are expected to have equivalent trajectories
going forward). So the only difference between the control group and the two treatment groups is the
type of program received. The outcomes observed after the program implementation will therefore
identify the effect of the program.

The training programs and logistical support were delivered by a Dushanbe-based firm with the
support of the Tax Committee from October 2014- January 2015. Firms were invited to attend a
general training on taxation through phone calls by trained operators. Firms were randomly assigned
into the treatment and control groups before the trainings but exactly the same script was used for
all firms. Out of 2,004 firms in the study database, 1,722 were contacted to achieve the desired sample
size. In total, 1,498 firms (87 percent of those called) attended trainings.2 Trainings were held in
either the Tax Committee office or the implementing partner office. On average, trainings lasted for 2
hours in Groups A and B and 1 hour in Group C.

A few days after each training, the implementing partner called back all firms in Group A and assisted
interested firms in registering for e-filing as follows: an agent from the implementing partner
collected the application form and supporting documents required for registration from the firm,
submitted them to the Tax Committee for processing and returned to install the software on the firm‚Äôs
computer and provide an e-token that contains the digital signature of the firm that must be used
every time the firm submits a declaration online. Figure 1 below illustrates the impact evaluation
design and the program implementation.




1 In addition, firms in this group would have been aware of the existence of e-filing from a reference to it in the
invitation materials and some questions in the baseline survey.
2 The Tax Committee organizes events and trainings for firms from time to time, so this program was not

unusual.

     2.3. Sampling
The study draws from the universe of firms in Dushanbe that are registered in the Tax Committee
database. All legal entities and individual entrepreneurs which are (i) simplified tax regime payers
(ii) have been active in the system for at least 2 years (i.e. not new enterprises or liquidated ones) and
(iii) are not currently e-filing were eligible for the study. There were 5,218 firms in the Tax Committee
database that met these three criteria.


                                                                                                        9
A list of 2,004 firms was randomly selected from this overall population with stratification on status
of the firm (legal entities or individual enterprises) and rayon (tax district). Based on discussions with
the Tax Committee and the implementing partner, this sample size of 2,000 firms was determined as
the number of firms that needed to be contacted to obtain the attendance of 1500 firms at a training
session. Since the intervention was expected to be more effective on legal entities which are usually
bigger firms than individual enterprises, we oversampled legal entities to have 75 percent of legal
entities and 25 percent of individual enterprises in the study population. Table 1 below gives the total
number of firms and the number selected in each stratum.

3. Data

    3.1. Data Sources
This study relies on three main sources of data. First, it uses administrative data from the Tax
Committee on variables on firm characteristics (risk score, size, ownership, legal status, industry and
region) and monthly data on e-filing use, tax declarations and payments, and audits.

The two other sources are the baseline survey of firms conducted at the beginning of each training
session and the endline survey conducted about one year later. The baseline survey was self-
administered (completed on paper forms by firm representatives) with detailed instructions and
examples provided by the implementing partner. The baseline survey includes information on firm
characteristics and economic behavior, as well as experiences of firms with the tax administration
process (such as compliance costs and assessment of taxation and the Tax Committee).

The endline survey differed from the baseline in that it was administered in-person by enumerators
at the firm's premises. In addition to the information collected in the baseline survey, the endline
survey included questions on additional topics such as firm performances (profit, number of
employees), tax behaviors (amount and type of tax paid, interactions with tax officials), and tax
inspections and audits (and perceived probability of audit).




                                                                                                       10
Table 2 below shows survey completion rates at endline for the different treatment arms. It shows
that 84 percent of the firms enrolled in the study were successfully surveyed at endline and this rate
was similar across control and treatment groups. About 13 percent of the firms liquidated since the
study started and attrition rate (refusal, firms that moved to another town, etc.) was very low (2.3
percent).

Finally, the study also relies on extensive interviews and focus groups with tax inspectors and firms
at different stages of the project to understand potential channels of impact and interpret findings.

    3.2. Firm Characteristics and Balance Checks
On average, firms in the study sample have 3.6 employees and are predominantly in the trade (40
percent) and services (43 percent) sectors. Sixty-eight percent of firms have internet access while less
than 40 percent use emails for business communication and less than 25 percent use electronic
program accounting. Firms visited the Tax Committee office, on average, slightly more than one time
per month. Appendix Table 1 shows summary statistics for variables from the administrative data
and the baseline survey. These tables also show that randomization achieved balance across the
different treatment groups for most variables.

An important firm characteristic for the analysis is the risk score. The Tax Committee assigns a risk
score to firms based on a proprietary algorithm that incorporates observed firm characteristics and
results of prior audits on other firms. We use this score as a measure of a firm's likelihood of evading
taxes. However, the Tax Authority only calculates this score for legal entities (75 percent of the
sample) so it is unavailable for individual entities.3

 Since randomization was stratified on legal status, this characteristic is perfectly balanced among the
different treatment groups.

                                                                                                                           11
4. Empirical Strategy

We use Equation (1) below to examine the relative impact of the two treatments in promoting e-filing
adoption, as well as the firm characteristics that are associated with adoption:

                              Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌªΩ0 + Ì†µÌªΩ1 Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ∞¥,Ì†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌªΩ2 Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ∞µ,Ì†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌºÜÌ†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñ + Ì†µÌºÄÌ†µÌ±ñ         (1)

Where Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñ is an indicator variable for whether a firm i registers for and uses e-filing, Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ∞¥,Ì†µÌ±ñ and Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ∞µ,Ì†µÌ±ñ are
indicators for the training with logistical help (Group A) and the training alone treatments (Group B)
respectively. Ì†µÌªΩ1 and Ì†µÌªΩ2 estimate the causal effect of receiving the two treatments respectively on
adoption and the difference between them, Ì†µÌªΩ1 ‚àí Ì†µÌªΩ2 , estimates the differential impact of the provision
of logistical support in addition to the training. Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñ is a vector of strata dummies‚Äîlegal status, sector
of activity and rayon. To examine firm characteristics that are associated with adoption, we include a
range of firm level variables in Equation (1).

To assess the impact of e-filing, we use Equation (1) above, and replace Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñ with Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±ñ , the outcome
variables of interest, to estimate the effect of being assigned to either of the two treatment groups
(the intent-to-treat estimate). We control for baseline measures of variables when available. In
addition, we use Equation (2) below to estimate the effect of e-filing on firms that adopted it because
of the program by using assignment to only Group A (the intensive treatment arm) as an instrumental
variable (IV) for adopting e-filing, the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE), since assignment to
Group B has no effect on e-filing adoption. As such, in all IV estimates, the effective control group
consists of both Groups B and C.

5. Results on Adoption of Electronic Tax Filing

    5.1. Adoption Rates Across Groups
By December 2015, about one year after program implementation, 93 percent of firms in Group A had
registered for e-filing and used it at least once. The combination of training with logistical support
with registration was successful at increasing e-filing adoption by 34 percentage points relative to the
control group (Table 3). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the adoption
rate for firms in Group B (63 percent) and those in Group C (59 percent), indicating that e-filing
training and demonstration did not promote e-filing adoption compared to brief mentions of e-filing
that firms in the control group were exposed to.

The large difference between the impact of the treatments in Groups A and B indicates that the
logistical help with registration helped to overcome an important constraint to e-filing registration.
This may be due to a number of reasons including helping firms navigate a complex registration
process, or helping them overcome procrastination. One additional possibility is that firms in Group
A may have felt coercion to register for e-filing due to the follow up support offered by the
implementing firm.

The lack of a significant difference between Groups B and C could be because neither of the two
treatments had any impact on firms, or because the limited exposure that control group firms had to
information on e-filing had effects as strong as the e-filing training. While there is currently no
available data on a randomly selected pure control group to investigate these two possibilities, we
can compare the study treatment groups to two groups of firms that are not included in the study:
first, the firms that were not contacted at all because the required number of firms was reached4, and
second, firms that were contacted but declined to participate in the training5. In both groups, the e-
filing adoption rate is about half of the control group at 25 percent and 24 percent respectively
suggesting that the brief mentions of the availability of e-filing in the control group had a significant
effect (that was not different from the effect of a detailed training on e-filing procedures and

4 This group is not random because the implementing firm may have selected to call certain types of firms
before others.
5 This group is also not random because firms with particular characteristics may have declined to participate.

demonstration). Indeed, 80 percent of firms in the control group indicated that they found out about
e-filing from the general tax training session they attended (Table 3).



    5.2. Firm Characteristics that Predict E-filing Adoption
This section examines firm characteristics that are associated with e-filing with particular attention
to the risk score of firms. Table 4 demonstrates that firms with higher risk score (the proxy for greater
likelihood of evasion) are significantly less likely to adopt e-filing.6 One standard deviation increase
in the risk score is associated with a 6.5 percentage point decrease in a firm‚Äôs likelihood of e-filing.
This result is consistent with higher risk firms preferring to deal directly with individual tax
inspectors with whom they have an ongoing relationship and are able to collude to pay less taxes.

In addition, firms that report extortion by tax officials to pay additional informal payments during tax
submissions during the baseline survey are more likely to adopt e-filing (Table 4). This result is
statistically significant for legal entities and is consistent with these firms seeking to avoid
interactions with tax collectors that lead to extortion.

Lastly, neither the gender of the owner nor the firm's level of comfort with technology (measured by
an index of whether or not the firm has high speed internet, uses email for business communications,
and maintains accounting records electronically) is significantly associated with the likelihood of e-
filing adoption.

  The first and third columns include the risk scores of firms. Since this measure is only available for legal
entities, the first column imputes the average value of the variable to all individual enterprises. For
comparison, the second and fourth columns show the relationship with other variables in the absence of the
risk score.

6. Results on Impact of Electronic Tax Filing
This section examines the impact of e-filing on direct outcomes (interactions with tax officials and
compliance costs), on intermediate outcomes (attitudes toward Tax Committee, informal behaviors



                                                                                                                     15
and actual and perceived level of monitoring), and on final outcomes (tax behavior and economic
performance).

    6.1. Impact on Compliance Costs and Interactions with Tax Officials
Table 5 presents estimates of program impact (Columns 1-6) on interactions with tax officials and
compliance costs and LATE estimates of the impact of e-filing adoption on those who adopt it because
of the program (Column 7). Firms that e-file as a result of the program visit the tax authority 1.4 fewer
times each month. In all, e-filing reduces time spent by firms on tax-related activities by 4.7 hours a
month. This effect is concentrated in activities that involve visiting the Tax Committee office
(submitting tax returns and obtaining the reconciliation act). As such, e-filing does fulfill the intended
goal of reducing tax compliance costs of firms. However, the time savings is a relatively modest share
of the overall 33 hours firms report spending on tax-related activities.

    6.2. Impact on Intermediate Outcomes
Table 6 presents the impact on intermediate outcomes. Consistent with the reduction in visits to the
tax office to submit declarations in person, e-filing also reduces the frequency of firms being required
by tax officials to increase their declarations at the point of submission, which from focus group
discussions was a major source of unofficial payments. Column 7 indicates that over the course of the
one-year study period, firms that e-file as a result of the program were 15 percentage points less likely
to have been required to increase their declaration. One potential concern is that if tax officials are no
longer able to influence firms' declarations at the point of submission, they may substitute with
increased audits and inspections at the firms' premises. We find no evidence that firms that adopt e-

                                                                                                                     16
filing due to the program are audited more or less often than firms that do not e-file, and e-filing firms
do not consider themselves to be at a greater likelihood of being audited.

On the other hand, we find no significant impact on indexes of attitudes towards taxation and the tax
authority and reported extortion.

    6.3. Impact on Firm Performances and Tax Payment
As detailed in Table 7, on average, we find no significant impacts of e-filing on firm tax payments, tax
declaration and business performance (number of employees, turnover, and profit). Standard errors
are however large and we cannot reject small positive or negative impacts. We use administrative
data to measure tax declarations and payments as the sum of the payments over the course of the
one-year study period.7 We also use survey on taxes paid in two focal months of the year, June and
December and obtain similar results.

 To allow that there may be learning effects, we also examined the sum of payments made in the last 6
months and in the last 3 months of 2015 but the results are similar

One potential mechanism by which e-filing may affect outcomes is by disrupting collusion between
evading firms and tax officials. As such, we examine whether e-filing has different impacts by baseline
values of firms‚Äô risk of evasion. We find evidence that firms with above-median risk score at baseline
increase the amount of taxes declared and paid, consistent with e-filing disrupting collusion between
firms and tax officials. In particular, we find that e-filing closes the tax revenue gap between firms
with above-median risk score and those with below-median risk score, thereby promoting horizontal
equity (Figure 2).

     6.4. Impact on other E-technology Adoption
A final result that may be relevant for the long term performance of the firm is that firms that e-file
become much more likely to adopt other electronic technology such as having internet on premises,
using email for business communication, maintaining accounting and tax records in electronic form
and using online banking to pay taxes (Table 8). As such, it appears that e-filing serves as a gateway
for firms to using other technologies that could potentially enhance firm productivity.

7. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

Administering the program (organizing the trainings, inviting firms, and providing logistical support
for e-filing registration to Group A firms) cost $25 per firm in Group A, compared to $17 per firm in
Group B and $12 per firm in Group C (Table 9). Given the 34 percentage point difference in take-up
between Group A and the control group, and the $13 per firm difference in program costs, the cost
per additional e-filing adoption in Group A relative to the control group is $37. The lack of any
significant difference between adoption in Group B and the control group indicates that the relevant
aspect of Group A treatment was the logistical help with registration. The difference in program costs
per firm between Group A and Group B (cost of logistical support for registration) is $8 per firm. Given
the 30 percentage point difference between Group A and Group B, the cost per additional e-filing
adoption in Group A relative to Group B is $27.

We can compare the program costs to the benefits that accrue to firms from the program.8 Table 5
estimates that firms save 4.7 hours each month that would have otherwise been spent on tax-related
activities. From survey data, the average wage of the person in charge of tax declaration in firms is
$178 per month (or $1.11 per hour), creating an estimated $5.5 savings by firms each month. As such,
it would take 5 to 7 months for private benefits in terms of time saved to exceed program costs.
Although firms may not necessarily be willing to pay the full costs of the program,9 these results
provide guidance for a social planner on the types of interventions that may be considered in
promoting e-filing adoption.



8. Conclusion and Policy Implications

The introduction of electronic tax filing in Tajikistan presents an important opportunity to improve
service delivery, reduce tax compliance costs of firms and disrupt avenues for unofficial behavior.
However, an important determinant of the benefits to be realized is the adoption decision of intended
users. By offering two sets of incentives, e-filing training and logistical help with registration versus
e-filing training alone, we show that enabling firms to overcome hurdles to registration by helping
them register significantly increases the likelihood that they use e-filing. This finding reflects the


8
  Current data limitations prevent us from calculating other potential benefits of the program such as savings
in tax administration costs. In addition, from the government's perspective, we detect no significant average
effects on tax revenue although any revenue impact would be a transfer from firms to the government.
9
  E-filing adoption remained quite low when firms had to pay $40 to register and obtain a token

                                                                                                             20
important role that hassle costs and procrastination play in the voluntary take up of different
government programs and suggests that the Tax Committee may increase e-filing adoption by
simplifying the process of registration or by offering a small nudge to register. In many countries,
firms do not need to complete a separate in-person registration process or obtain an e-token in order
to e-file and can simply begin to submit their declarations online. Given the lack of significant
difference between Groups B and C, it also appears that firms do not require significant training from
the Tax Committee to learn how to use the e-filing system.

A second major result with policy implications is that certain firm characteristics are associated with
e-filing adoption. In particular, firms that report extortion from tax officials during in-person
submission of tax declarations are more likely to e-file. On the other hand, firms with a higher risk of
evasion, that are likely to benefit from colluding with tax officials are less likely to adopt e-filing and
the intensive treatment arm, Group A, where over 90 percent of firms began to e-file was able to
attract more risky firms to begin to e-file. While this may seem to suggest making e-filing mandatory
for all firms, it is important to consider that experiences from other countries indicate that forcing
firms to e-file may lead to adverse consequences such as increased compliance costs for firms that do
not have the capacity to do so.10

Lastly, the results show that although e-filing reduces the amount of time firms spent on tax-related
activities and reduces tax harassment, we find no significant impacts on firm productivity or tax
payment for firms on average. However, e-filing appears to have multiplier effects by encouraging
firms to use other electronic technology in their businesses that may affect their productivity in the
long run.

Appendix 1: Construction of Indices

Index of technological use: Share of technological practices implemented among the following
practices: "has high speed internet on premises," "uses emails for business communication,"
"maintain accounting and tax records electronically."

Index of extortion (at baseline and at endline): This index is the share of positive answers to the
following questions: ‚ÄúFirm says firms often or always have to give bribes,‚Äù ‚ÄúReason given for why
some firms give bribes is that inspector insists on higher payments to fulfill his revenue plan‚Äù and
‚ÄúReason given for why some firms give bribes is that inspector threatens firms with higher taxes and
penalties.‚Äù

Score (out of 3) of perception of Tax Committee: Number of Tax committee characteristics that are
considered as "good" or "very good" by the respondent. The 3 characteristics are the following:
"Professionalism and competency of tax officials"; "Readiness to help" and "Fairness and honesty.

Score (out of 4) of perception of taxation: Number of aspects of taxation for which the respondent
said he/she is "satisfied" of "very satisfied." The 4 characteristics are the following: "Amount of time
required for tax accounting," "Clarity of tax legislation," "Level of tax control," and "Level of tax rates."

Summary index of (positive) evaluation of tax authority characteristics: The characteristics are the
following: Professionalism and competency of tax officials; Readiness to help; Fairness and honesty
and Availability of useful explanations of tax laws. The index was built as follows: each of
characteristics was graded on a 1 to 4 scale by respondents, then we standardized scores for each
characteristic using the control group standard deviation and mean. Finally, we took the average of
the standardized score.

Summary index of level of satisfaction with different aspects of taxation: The characteristics are the
following: Amount of time required for tax accounting; Number of taxes and fees; Clarity of tax
legislation; Level of tax control; Level of tax rates; Frequency of submission of tax reports. The index
was built following same steps as for the previous index.

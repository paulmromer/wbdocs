Executive Summary

         In order to more directly link payments and funding at the provider level with the
          quantity and quality of health services performed, Cameroon started a Performance
          Based Financing (PBF) pilot in the health sector in 2012 in 14 districts in three regions
          of the country: East, South West and North West. Performance-based financing is a
          health systems management tool designed to increase the efficiency of health system
          inputs to improve the coverage and quality of priority maternal and child health services
          by paying health facilities bonuses linked to the quantity and quality of services
          delivered.
         The PBF pilot was accompanied by a prospective randomized impact evaluation. In
          order to distinguish the influence of the different components of the PBF reform, the
          evaluation compared four arms: (1) the standard PBF package, (2) the same level of
          financing but not linked to performance, and with the same levels of supervision,
          monitoring, and autonomy as PBF, (3) no additional resources or autonomy, but the
          same levels of supervision and monitoring as PBF, and (4) pure comparison. The
          randomization took place at the health facility level and overall the four study groups
          were well balanced at baseline.
         The evaluation used a combination of household and health facility surveys conducted at
          baseline and endline to assess the impact of the interventions.
         The research questions of the impact evaluation and the responses found are summarized
          in the table below.

       absenteeism?                              workers present.



From a policy point of view, these impact evaluation results suggest the following take-away
lessons:
     1) In general, PBF is an efficient mechanism to bring payments and funding at the provider
        level, leading to significant increases in coverage (child and maternal immunization,
        family planning, HIV testing) and improvements in structural quality of care. It also
        leads to a decrease in out-of-pocket payments, in particular unofficial payments.
     2) For many of those outcomes, the differences between the PBF group (T1) and the
        additional financing group (C1) are not significant. It should be noted that the C1 group
        offered all the elements of PBF except the direct link between individual facility
        performance and additional financing. It is not obvious these differences in intervention
        design have been salient enough for staff and management.
     3) There was, however, a clear effect for the importance of additional financing plus
        reinforced supervision through PBF instruments (comparing groups T1 and C1 vs groups
        C2 and C3). Enhanced supervision and monitoring are not sufficient to improve MCH
        outcomes.
     4) The absence of impacts for some MCH indicators such as skilled deliveries and ANC
        visits was surprising. It is possible that the supply-side incentives for providers were not
        sufficient given existing user fees which might act as a barrier on the demand-side. A
        policy discussion about combining demand-side and supply-side incentives would be
        useful.
     5) In terms of quality of care, most of the positive impacts were observed on structural
        quality. However, despite an increase in providers and supplies available at health
        facilities, PBF did not increase the completeness of service provision (content of care)
        during antenatal care and child health consultations. Further reflection and efforts should
        be devoted to identify mechanisms to incentivize or otherwise improve the content of
        care beyond equipment, supplies and staff availability.

Background

Country context

Cameroon is a country of approximately 24.36 million people, with 54% of the population
residing in urban areas. The country is classified as a lower-middle-income country with a GDP
per capita of US$ 3,100 in 2015 (Central Intelligence Agency 2016). Relative to other countries
in Central Africa, Cameroon has a favorable economic environment including modest oil
resources which account for 40% of export earnings, productive agricultural conditions, and the
availability of high value timber species, and minerals (Central Intelligence Agency 2016; The
World Bank 2016a). In recent years, several large infrastructure projects have led to increased
growth in public works and construction and services and the economy as a whole has
experienced steady economic growth with annual GPD growth rates between 5.6 – 5.9%
between 2013 and 2016 (Central Intelligence Agency 2016). Nonetheless, Cameroon suffers
from relatively high levels of income inequality, weak governance, corruption and high levels of
poverty (The World Bank 2016a). The poverty rate of 37.5% in 2014 represents a decline of less
than 3 percentage points from the rate in 2001 (40.2%). The poverty rate is greater in rural areas
where approximately 56.8% of the population lives in poverty, and this rate has increased over
the last fifteen years from 52.1% in 2001. At 8.9% in 2014, the urban poverty rate is much lower
and has declined from 17.9% in 2001 (Institut National de la Statistique 2015c). Life expectancy
at birth is 58.5 years and has actually decreased slightly over the last decade (Bove et al. 2013).
Sixty percent of the population in Cameroon is less than 25 years old and the fertility rate
remains high at 4.                                                             .


Health background

Despite being one of the more wealthy countries in the Central African region, and the country’s
relatively high health spending of $59 per capita in 2014 (The World Bank 2016b), Cameroon’s
health indicators resemble countries that spend much less on health care (The World Bank
2016c). Cameroon did not achieve Millennium Development Goals 4 & 5 which called for large
reductions in maternal and child mortality (MDGs) (United Nations Statistical Division 2015).
Moreover, Cameroon is one of the few countries with high maternal mortality where maternal
mortality did not decrease at all between 1990 and 2015 (Alkema et al. 2015). One in every 25
women of reproductive age in Cameroon continue to die from pregnancy-related causes (Institut
National de la Statistique (INS) et ICF International 2012). Though many factors affect maternal
mortality, one potential explanation for the country’s slow progress in achieving declines in
maternal mortality is that the proportion of women delivering in health facilities has remained
unchanged over much of the last decade. During the last ten years (between 2004 and 2014), the
percentage of deliveries that were assisted by a skilled health professional increased from 61.7
percent to only 64.7 percent (ICF International 2012; Institut National de la Statistique 2015a).
Skilled delivery assistance varies considerable by wealth and region in Cameroon. For instance,
21% of women in the poorest wealth quintile accessed skilled delivery care while almost 98% of


                                                                                                 6
women in the highest wealth quintile gave birth with a skilled attendant. Skilled delivery is
lowest in the Extreme North where approximately 29% of women deliver with a skilled provider
compared to over 96% in West region (Institut National de la Statistique 2015b).

Like skilled delivery, the percentage of women receiving four or more antenatal care visits,
another health service with the potential to decrease maternal and child mortality, remained
unchanged over the last decade. In 2004, 59.1% of women had received four antenatal visits, the
number recommended by the World Health Organization, compared to 58.8% in 2014 (Institut
National de la Statistique 2015b). Even when women obtain antenatal services, they still may
not receive important service components due to low quality of care. Previous studies have
shown that fewer than half of women are informed about the danger signs to look for during
pregnancy, over 40% did not have the recommended number of tetanus vaccinations during
their last pregnancy (ICF International 2012), and 25% did not provide a urine sample to test for
protein, a required procedure to test for preeclampsia (The World Bank 2013a).

Child mortality declined in Cameroon by approximately 21% between 1991 and 2014 (ICF
International 2012; Institut National de la Statistique 2015a; Institut National de la Statistique
(INS) et ICF International 2012); nonetheless, according to the most recent data approximately 1
in 10 children still die before their fifth birthday (Alkema et al. 2015; The United Nations
Children's Fund 2015). The greatest reductions in child mortality were observed in the East (90
per 1,000 live births) and the South (50 per 1,000 live births), while the rate changed very
little in Douala and Yaoundé. National averages obscure the large regional disparities that exist
in child survival in Cameroon. Child mortality is over three times higher in North region (173
per 1,000 live births) than in the country’s two largest cities Doula (52 per 1,000 live births) and
Yaoundé (42 per 1,000 live births) (Institut National de la Statistique 2015b).


Health financing challenges in Cameroon

Several aspects of the health care financing landscape in Cameroon contribute to the low quality
of primary health care service provision, and sub-optimal coverage of essential maternal and
child health care services. Cameroon spends $10 dollars more than the average for Sub-Saharan
Africa (excluding South Africa) and has similarly high health spending to Senegal and Nigeria
(Bove et al. 2013). However, despite this relatively high level of spending, the share of
government spending on health is low and has not reached above 9 percent of the total budget in
the previous 10 years (Bove et al. 2013). This amount falls short of the commitment of 15% of
the annual budget to improve the health sector made by countries in the African Union in April
2001 in Abuja. Due to these low levels, in 2012 the share of per capita total health spending paid
for by the government was only US $14 (i.e. 21.7 percent). Much of the remaining 70.4% of
health spending is paid for through out-of-pocket users fees (Ministere de la Sante Publique
2016). Another important part of the problem is that the operational level receives a small
fraction of the health budget. Although the health sector budget has more than doubled in recent
years, the majority of these resources have been allocated for administration and infrastructure.
This has resulted in a scarcity of funds to meet operating expenses incurred in the day-to-day
business of a district health system (e.g., consumables, drugs, regular maintenance, community
outreach, etc.) (Ministere de la Sante Publique 2016). Further, funds are not targeted towards the
most underserved populations, or to health facilities operating in more challenging
socioeconomic or security contexts (Ministere de la Sante Publique 2016). Along with high out-
of-pocket costs for care and the low level of financing for primary health care, the unequal
distribution of medical professionals in Cameroon may also contribute to inadequate coverage
of essential health services. While there are 1.9 doctors per 10,000 people in Cameroon, most of


                                                                                                  7
these health workers are employed in urban areas and over half work in just three regions:
Center, Littoral and West (Bove et al. 2013). North region is home to 18% of the population but
only 8% of physicians, and while 18% of the population lives in Center, this region contains
40% of the national physicians (Bove et al. 2013).



Performance Based Financing

Performance Based Financing (PBF) comprises a set health system reforms meant to increase
the coverage and quality of essential health services, as well as efficiency and equity, often with
a special focus on maternal and child health. PBF program models differ but all involve the
purchasing of health services using a pre-defined list of services and prices (Fritsche, Soeters,
and Meessen 2014). Performance-based financing also includes a strong verification system that
relies on systematic and detailed review of health facility records as well as community-level
client tracing whereby reported patients are asked a series of questions to confirm health care
receipt (Fritsche et al. 2014). Quality is verified using quality checklists, which cover a variety
of core domains. For instance, aspects covered under the water and sanitation domain might
include the availability of an incinerator, latrines, and a water source, and the absence of organic
waste or used syringes in the clinic. For antenatal care, privacy, and the availability of
functioning equipment are assessed. In addition, the verification teams review a sample of
patient records for antenatal care to assess adherence to recommended protocols.

Many PBF programs also involve increasing health facility autonomy. The most essential
components of autonomy as defined in the PBF Toolkit, include the choice to procure inputs
locally rather than from a central supply, use of a bank account, autonomy to hire, fire and
discipline staff etc. Finally, PBF also provides a number of tools and mechanisms to improve the
management of the health facility. The first tool is the business plan, which outlines the baseline
conditions at the health facility, sets goals in terms of expected results, and then describes
strategies to achieve these goals (Fritsche et al. 2014). The second management tool is health
care provider performance evaluation checklists, which assesses provider performance in areas
such as timeliness, collaboration with colleagues, initiative, and the quality of their work as
measured by their adherence to norms and standards. Finally, the third tool is the indice tool,
which helps the facility to manage cash income and expenses and plan the facility budget. It
includes revenues (e.g. user fees, PBF subsidies, and expenses (e.g. medicines, supplies &
equipment) from the past quarter, quarterly financial activities, and the budget for performance
bonuses (Fritsche et al. 2014).

PBF timeline in Cameroon

Cameroon’s first experience with PBF began with the Redynamisation des Soins de Sante à
l’Est du Cameroun (REDSSEC) project. In 2006, REDSSEC implemented a pilot Performance
Based Financing (PBF) program in Faith Based Organization (FBO) facilities in the East region
with support from Cordaid and Catholic Relief Services. The project began with 4 FBO facilities
in Batouri district, and then expanded to FBO facilities in Bertoua, Doume and Yokadouma
districts through 2011 (Figure 1).

In 2008, the World Bank approved a US$25 million loan to the government of Cameroon
through the Bank’s Health Sector Support Investment Project (HSSIP). In 2011, through support
from the HSSIP, a PBF pre-pilot began in the Littoral region covering four health districts. The
program began in July 2012 in the North West and South West regions, with four districts

                                                                                                  8
included in each region. In October 2012 the program expanded to the East region, covering all
14 health districts in the region.

Out of the 26 health districts throughout Cameroon implementing PBF, 14 districts were
included in the impact evaluation (see figure 2 and Appendix B). The other 12 (4 in Littoral and
8 in the East) had already begun implementing some form of PBF before the impact evaluation
baseline survey was conducted (either through the Littoral pre-pilot or the REDSSEC project in
the East), and were thus excluded from the evaluation.

Program overview

The administrative and technical aspects of the PBF program in Cameroon were managed at the
regional level by Performance Purchasing Agencies (PPA). PPAs are autonomous entities that
have a contractual relationship with the government of Cameroon who entrusts the agencies
with the management of funding intended for health care providers. All PBF health facilities
sign a Performance Contract issued by the PPA which described conditions required to obtain
PBF subsidies. These requirements include the management improvement, minimum quality
levels, governance and financial inclusion, and clauses for termination of the contract.
Additionally, PBF facilities prepared quarterly business plans and used frameworks for the
health administration linked to performance payments. All facilities were trained to use the
indice tool; however, use of the indice tool varied among Cameroon PBF facilities.

PBF contracts were signed for a period of 3 months. Health facilities with performance contracts
were responsible for completing registers and a monthly activity report/declaration form. This
report and registers were used to document reported health service provision and were used as
the primary basis for service verification. A list of the health services subsidized by the program,
and the subsidy amounts is located in Appendix C. A copy of this report was sent to the PPA
each month. After the verification of the quantity of services provided and declared in the
monthly report was completed, the bill of health facility was established and paid monthly. The
declarations form verified and validated was used to justify the payment subsidies provided to
the health facility.


Service verification
Health service verification was completed on a monthly basis by the Fund Holder Agency
supervisors. The Fund Holder Agency supervisors used the facility register and tally sheets to
verify that the number of services reported by the health facility in the payment request form
was consistent with the facility documentation. Should the supervisor encounter any errors,
these problems are corrected in the presence of the facility staff, and any fraudulent cases are
tracked and documented. As an added means of quantity verification, a sample of patients for
each health service subsidized was contacted either by phone or in person by local associations
to confirm that they received the health service reported by the health facility and to assess
patient satisfaction. Additionally, the District Medical Team in collaboration with the Fund
Holder Agency assessed the quality of the health services provided by PBF health facilities. This
assessment used a standardized checklist to verify that a minimum quality level is met, and to
calculate a quality score for the health facility ranging from 0 – 100%. The quality score is used
to calculate a quality bonus that is received by the health facility. The quality checklist is
available in Appendix D.


Calculation of payments

The validated quantitative data, and the quality assessment were used to calculate performance
payments for PBF health facilities. The quality bonus provided an increase of up to 30% of the
total payment based on health service quantity. This percentage depended on the health facility
quality score. Quality assessments were conducted quarterly, and focused on facility
management, hygiene and sanitation, as well as specific attributes of service delivery. The
services delivery items included, including among many other categories, listing user charges,
privacy, the condition of the waiting area and consultation room, and the correct management of
cases (full quality assessment in Appendix D). For example, if the health facility received a 65%
quality score, and their total payment amount based on the services they provided was 597,240

                                                                                                 12
CFA, the quality bonus provided to the health facility would be calculated as follows: 597,240 x
0.30 x 0.65 = 116,461 CFA, and the total payment to the health facility would be 597,240 +
116,461 = 713,701 CFA.

Additionally, an equity bonus was included in the calculation of performance payments. The
equity bonus was paid to health facilities that faced serious structural problems making service
provision more challenging. Equity Bonuses ranged from 0% to 80% of the basic subsidy. Each
region applied the criteria listed below differently. North West and South West applied the same
scoring; however, few facilities in South West received the equity bonus since all almost all
facilities in the region were located in urban areas. The East region had a slightly difference
scoring approach but also used the same criteria.

The following issues were considered in the calculation of this bonus:
        Geographical inaccessibility (hard-to-reach) that makes it difficult the retain staff;
        The size of the health area and low population densities that create viability issues
          (high running costs)
        Extreme poverty

The facility management committee had the authority to decide on the allocation of PBF
revenue. These decisions must have been clearly documented in facility business plans.

Research questions of the impact evaluation

Over time, PBF has been implemented in a growing number of countries. Many studies have
shown a positive association between PBF and health service coverage, and some with
improvements in quality. An early impact evaluation in Rwanda where districts were randomly
assigned to treatment (PBF) and comparison (input financing with matched financial resources)
found large and statistically significant positive impacts on institutional deliveries and
preventive care visits from young children and also on quality of prenatal care (Basinga et al.
2010). After this promising start, many other quasi-experimental studies that have shown
similarly positive results                                                                 , and
several others have shown favorable results for many – though not all – outcomes assessed


                             the research community has not reached a consensus about the
effectiveness of PBF at increasing health service coverage (Huillery and Seban 2014). The PBF
design in the Demogratric Republic of the Congo studied by Huillery and Seban 2014 deviated
from the planned intervention design and what are now considered PBF best practices,
potentially explaining the findings (The World Bank 2014). Moreover, few studies have
examined the factors and mechanisms that influence the impact of PBF− an area of considerable
operational significance since PBF often involves a package of constituent interventions: linking
payment and results, independent verification of results, managerial autonomy to facilities and
enhanced systematic supervision of facilities.

As PBF had never been implemented in Cameroon on any meaningful scale and had never been
systematically evaluated, our larger policy objectives for the impact evaluation are to (a)
Identify the impact of PBF on maternal and child health (MCH) service coverage and quality,
and to (b) Identify key factors responsible for this impact. In doing so, we expect that the results
from the impact evaluation will be useful to designing national PBF policy in Cameroon and
will also contribute to the larger body of knowledge on PBF. Though we are interested in a wide
range of outcomes in this report, we consider the main outcomes in terms of coverage to be


                                                                                                 13
ANC including anti-tetanus vaccination, skilled deliveries, vaccinations and family planning.
We used skilled deliveries for the power calculations to determine the study sample size.

The impact evaluation will focus on the following research questions:

   1. Does the PBF program increase the coverage of MCH services?

   2. Does the PBF program increase the quality of MCH services delivered?

   3. Is it the enhanced monitoring & evaluation and supervision or the link between payments
      and results that leads to improvements observed in quality or coverage?

   4. What is the contribution of enhanced supervision and monitoring to improving MCH
      service coverage and quality in the absence of increased autonomy or additional
      financial resources?

In addition, the impact evaluation will also examine the following research questions that relate
to intermediate outcomes in the hypothesized causal pathway:

   1. Does the PBF program lower informal charges for health services?

   2. Does the PBF program lower formal user charges?

   3. Does the PBF program improve physical and social accessibility of health services?
      Accessibility of health services will be examined in terms of the convenience of facility
      opening hours, availability of services through outreach, client perceptions of
      convenience of accessing health services and client perceptions of health providers’
      attitudes towards clients

   4. Does the PBF program lower staff absenteeism?

Methods

This report and the methods described below are focused on the quantitative component of a
mixed method impact evaluation. A qualitative midline study was conducted in 2014 and the
endline study took place in 2016. Results from the qualitative component will be shared in a
separate report in the spring of 2017.

Treatment groups

Table 2 below describes the 4 study groups formed by randomizing Medicalized Health Centers
(CMAs), or primary health centers with a medical doctor on staff, and Integrated Health Centers
(CSIs) (primary health care centers without a doctor). The randomization for this study was at
the health facility level. From an operational and public health perspective, randomizing at the
district level would have make more sense given the proximity of some facilities. Indeed, the
risk with facility-level randomization is that neighboring facilities from different groups might
learn from each other and apply principles outside their treatment group. However, this was not
feasible given that the Government of Cameroon had already decided and announced which
districts would be included in the PBF pilot. Randomization at the district level was therefore
precluded.


                                                                                                14
Public randomization ceremonies were held in each region between February and June 2012,
just prior to the launching of the PBF program in each region (The World Bank 2013b). All
health facility management staff from health facilities in the districts covered by the evaluation
attended the randomization ceremony. We hope to answer the main research questions identified
by making comparisons between these groups.

For the purposes of our study, the ‘full’ PBF package of interventions included the following
elements:

   Linking payment and results, including performance bonuses for health workers
   Independent monitoring of results
   Systematic supervision of health facilities defined as regular supervision by an external
    supervisor from the district hospital team using a structured checklist and providing
    immediate feedback to facility staff on problems identified and potential solutions to
    improve service delivery. Systematic supervision included monitoring whether the facility is
    complying with national user fee guidelines
   Limited managerial autonomy to facilities defined as autonomy over use of resources
    combined the ability to hire additional staff using health facility income and managerial
    discretion

Facilities in group T1 implemented this full PBF package. Facilities assigned to group C1
received a fixed per capita budgetary supplement that matches the per capita budgetary
allocation for T1 facilities. However, this supplement was not linked to performance. C1
facilities received the same supervision and monitoring and managerial autonomy over the
budgetary supplement received. Both T1 and C1 facility managers had the autonomy to hire
staff with their PBF revenues or budgetary supplement received, and also to fire these staff if
necessary. T1 and C1 facility managers also had the autonomy over how to use these revenues.
C2 facilities received no additional resources but the same supervision and monitoring as T1 and
C1 facilities. District-level supervisors responsible for supervising T1, C1 and C2 facilities used
the same tools and received the same supplementary payments for visits to facilities in these
three groups. However, quality scores were linked to facility payments only in the case of T1
facilities. C3 facilities were the ‘business as usual’ facilities and did not receive any additional
resources or inputs. C2 and C3 facility managers did not have the autonomy to hire/ fire staff or
financial autonomy. National user fee caps, and facility user fee rates, were published on a
signboard placed in all study group health facilities. The IE team also included monitoring of
adherence to national guidelines as part of the monitoring and supervision intervention in T1, C1
and C2 facilities. As the status quo group, the C3 facilities did not receive this additional
monitoring & supervision.

The number, type, and percent private of study health facilities in each study district are shown
in Table 3. All public and private health facilities in the 14 study districts that were officially

                                                                                                  15
registered with the Ministry of Public Health were eligible for inclusion in the study. All district
hospitals in 14 health districts were included in the full PBF (i.e., treatment) arm. This is
because district hospitals play a critical role in supervising and acting as source of referral
services for all facilities in the district. District hospitals did supervise and support treatment and
comparison group CMAs and CSIs differently based on the group they are assigned to.
Household and facility-based surveys were be implemented in district hospitals and households
associated with their catchment areas1 in the 14 pilot districts to gain insights into the role that
district hospitals are playing in the 4 study groups. However, these data will not be used for
making inferences about the impact of PBF, and are not included in the analyses presented in
this report.

Data sources

The evaluation relied on two main sources of data to answer the impact evaluation research
questions identified:




1Some villages will not fall within the catchment areas of other CSIs and CMAs in the district.
Households in these villages will be excluded from the sample for the impact evaluation.

                                                                                                    16
   1. Household surveys: A household survey implemented at baseline (i.e., before
      implementation of PBF began), and at endline (i.e., after PBF was implemented for two
      years).
   2. Facility-based surveys: A facility-based survey was also implemented at baseline and at
      endline.


Household surveys
The impact evaluation adapted the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) survey
instruments for this impact evaluation. Household surveys were conducted in each of the 14
districts included in the impact evaluation. To select the households to be surveyed, a catchment
area was first established for each of the 245 primary care facilities. GIS mapping was
conducted before the baseline survey to define realistic catchment areas for health facilities. GIS
mapping was necessary because the government does not have a clearly defined health map with
specific catchment areas. The government defines instead “Health Areas? (similar to sub-
districts) that often include several facilities. As such it was necessary to define “zones of
responsibility? for each facility. This GIS mapping defined ‘true’ catchment areas by taking into
account physical features (like terrain or water bodies) and roads that influence travel time and
thereby potentially affect health facility choice. One village from each health facility catchment
area was randomly selected for the household survey. Regional maps of the study health
facilities are presented in Appendix B.

A village household listing exercise was first conducted to identify all village households. At
baseline 16 of the households identified in the listing exercise were randomly selected to be
surveyed in each village. The survey team attempted to revisit all baseline households at
endline. However, many baseline households could not be located or were no longer eligible at
endline. When this occurred, baseline households were replaced using the nearest neighbor as
recorded in the listing exercise. An additional four households were added to the household
sampling roster at endline such that a total of 20 households were sampled in each village for the
endline survey. In both rounds, the primary inclusion criteria for the household survey was that
household must have contained at least one woman who had been pregnant in the 24 months
preceding the survey. Though the sample was meant to be a panel, with repeat sampling of the
same households at baseline and endline, only a small proportion of households sampled at
endline were also sampled at baseline. For instance, only 29% of the 4,813 households from
which the 6,275 pregnant women surveyed at endline resided were also sampled at baseline.
Therefore, the surveys are analyzed as repeated cross-sectional surveys rather than panel data in
this report.

The household survey was administered to all members of the household who were present on
the day of data collection. Demographic data including educational attainment and labor force
participation was collected from all adult members of the household. Data on recent illness and
health care use in the past four weeks was collected from all household members, with primary
care givers providing information about child health. Household level data on housing
characteristics, household assets and household level income was provided by the head of
household. Additionally the household survey contained separate modules for women of
reproductive age (15 – 49 years), women who had been pregnant in the 24 months before the
survey, and for children under five years of age. The main health themes covered in these
modules included:

      Health behaviors for MCH services
      Health seeking behaviors, barriers to use and health service use


                                                                                                17
       Household health expenditures
       General perceptions of health service quality

In addition, the survey teams weighed and measured the height of all children aged under 5
years present in the household during the survey team’s visit.


Facility-based survey
The facility survey was conducted in all the CMAs, CSIs and District Hospitals in the 14
districts included in the impact evaluation. All facility team visits were unannounced. The
facility-based survey included multiple components. The sample of health workers, patient-
provider observations and client exit interviews was selected to enable findings from these three
components to be linked.

Facility assessment module
The facility assessment module collected data on key aspects of facility functioning and
structural aspects of quality of care. The individual in charge of the health facility at the time
when the survey team visited the health facility was asked to be the respondent for this survey
module. The main themes that were covered by the facility assessment included:

   Facility staffing, including the staffing complement of the facility, staff on duty at the time
    of the survey team’s visit and staff present at the time of the survey team’s visit
   Facility infrastructure and equipment
   Availability of drugs, consumables and supplies at the health facility
   Supervision
   Record keeping and reporting to the Health Management Information System
   Facility management
   Official user charges at the facility
   Revenues obtained at the health facility, and how revenues have been used


Health worker interview module
For health facilities with more than five health workers, a list of all clinical staff who worked in
the area of maternal and child health providing prenatal or under five consultations was
obtained. If this list contained more than five people, study enumerators interviewed a random
sample of these health workers. If the list contained fewer than five people, all clinical personnel
working in maternal and child health were interviewed. The interviews focused on the following
areas:

   Role and responsibilities of the interviewed health worker
   Compensation, including delays in salary payments
   Staff satisfaction and motivation


Observations of patient-provider interaction module
While the health worker interview module collects information on what health workers know,
the purpose of this module is to gather information on what health workers actually do with their
patients.

A member of the survey team observed consultations with a systematic random sample of
patients under five presenting with a new condition (i.e., not for follow-up visits or routine) and


                                                                                                     18
new ANC clients. The observer used a structured format to note whether key desired actions
were carried out. In the case of patients under five, the instruments were focused on whether
IMCI protocols are followed. For ANC clients the instruments examined whether key desired
actions (including counseling) were carried out. As primary care facilities do not offer ANC
services on all days of the week – typically these are offered 2 days each week – the ANC
module was not conducted at all health facilities. During the baseline survey, 5 under-5 and 5
ANC observations were conducted at each facility where these modules are implemented. After
finding that many health facilities did not offer ANC on the day of the survey at baseline, during
the endline survey enumerators were asked to interview as many women receiving ANC on the
day of the survey as possible to increase the sample size. All health workers selected for patient-
provider observations will be included in the health worker interview sample.

Patient exit interviews
Enumerators conducted an exit interview with all patients whose consultation was observed as
part of the study procedures. If the patient was a child, the child’s caregiver was interviewed.
The under-fives included in the patient exit sample were the same children whose consultation
with a provider was observed. In addition to this, exit interviews were conducted with all ANC
clients whose consultation with a provider was observed.

Where  is receipt of the health service for woman/pregnancy i in enumeration area j in
survey year t.  is an enumeration area fixed effect, 2015 is a dummy variable that is equal to 0
in 2012 (baseline) and 1 in 2015 (endline). T1, C1, and C2 are dummy variables that are equal to
1 when the enumeration area was assigned to the each treatment group respectively and zero
otherwise. The treatment variable is based on the assigned catchment area where the household
is located; however, this may not have been the health facility were the household sought health
care. 1 1 2015 , 2 1 2015 ,  3 22015 are interaction terms between each the T1, C1,
and C2 groups and the post indicator. These interaction terms measure the treatment effect in
each group and can be interpreted as the difference in the change in health service use over the
study period between the control group, and each treatment group respectively.  ′  is a vector
of control variables at the individual level (age, marital status, education level, religion,
ethnicity, working status and type of work), and at the household level (number of individuals in
the household, housing type, house ownership, water source, and type of sanitation). Control
variables were included in all analysis of household level data.

A similar specification was used in most facility level analysis; however, in all analyses
involving direct observation or exit interview data we have used an alternative specification

without facility fixed effects. The alternative specification was chosen after finding that the
variable measuring the duration of ANC visits contained many outliers, and the use of fixed
effects produced results that diverged widely from changes observed descriptively by comparing
means. Therefore this analysis instead included treatment group dummy variables to control for
baseline differences between groups. For consistency, all analysis of women sampled from
antenatal care, and of caregivers sampled from child health consultations used this alterative
specification. Additionally, sampling for these services was limited in many health facilities
because antenatal care is only provided on certain days or the week, and due to low patient
flows in smaller facilities. For this reason, analysis of patients sampled from health facilities was
not restricted to health facilities represented in both the baseline and endline survey data.

Analysis at the facility level included the following time invariant controls: type of health
facility (public/religious/private) and location of the health facility (urban/rural). Additionally,
when the analysis was at the individual level (i.e. women sampled from ANC visits, care givers
sampled from child health consultations) the following individual level controls were also
included: age, sex, marital status, and education level.

Cameroon PBF Impact Evaluation Results

Tables 5 & 6 below display the baseline levels of individual and household level characteristics
from the household survey. Group level means are compared individually using two-sample
statistical testing, and F-tests were conducted to test for overall differences in the four study
groups. The tables show that there were several statistically significant differences between
study groups at baseline for individual level variables. In particular, the study groups were not
balanced at baseline on religion and ethnicity. However, the groups appear balanced on many
other dimensions including educational attainment, employment. The groups were also balanced
for most categories of marital status though a greater proportion of women sampled in the T1
group described their marital status as in union. The study treatment groups were generally well
balanced on household level characteristics including household composition, type of household
and household ownership. However, the study groups were not balanced at baseline on the type
of water source used at the household, and on household sanitation type.

Comparison of operational funds available and subsidy payments to C1 and T1 at
endline

One important feature of the impact evaluation design was that the subsidies provided to control
group 1 (C1) – which were not linked to performance – should be equal to the payment amounts
provided to facilities in the full PBF treatment group. At endline, the health facility survey
collected data on the amount of funding available at the health facilities for operation expenses,
including the amount of revenue collected from cost recovery, funding provided directly by the
Ministry of Health, and subsidies from the PBF program. To verify the equal receipt of
financing, we compared data on total financing available, and subsidy amount received between
T1 and C1 health facilities. The first panel of the table below displays the average amount of
health facility revenue from all of these sources during each trimester of 2014 in T1, the full
PBF group, and C1, the increased financing group. The second panel compares the amount of
subsidies received in each of the two groups. Neither the subsidy amount, nor the total amount
of financing available at the health facility differed statistically between the two groups during
any trimester of 2014. We also sought to assess whether per capita payments were equal
between groups, as this was the intention of the study. However, exact catchment area
population numbers are not known. Therefore, we standardized payments by the number of
health workers in each facility as a proxy measure for catchment area population. Using this
proxy measure, we found no differences in payment amounts between groups (Table 9, panels 3
& 4).

We also confirmed the subsidy data collected in the facility questionnaire by requesting subsidy
data from the regional funds. This data, which represents the payments made by the regional
funds to the health facilities in treatment groups T1 (full PBF) and C1 (additional financing), is
presented in figures 3 – 5 below. These figures also show that the total payments provided to the
health facilities in each treatment group were equal during the entire study period.

While the payment results show that overall the two groups received equivalent financing
volumes for the same number of health facilities (approximately 50 each) during the study
period, when looking at per capita financing we find that the C1 group in fact received higher
levels of per capita financing than the T1 group. This is largely due to the fact that in the South-
West region, while the T1 and C1 groups had the same number of facilities (21 for T1 and 20
for C1), the total population covered by these health facilities varied substantially. In the T1
group several health facilities had very large catchment areas, resulting in a target population
approximately three times higher than in the C1 group. As such the per capita payments in the
South-West region were three times higher for the C1 group than the T1 group, which also
affects the overall annual per capita payments (Figure 6). That being said, the overall payments
for each group, when combining the three regions, shows equal payments across the two groups
(Figure 7). Populations of catchment areas in Cameroon should also be interpreted with
precaution given the lack of an up-to-date and comprehensive national health map.

Analysis of household care seeking behavior

For the household survey, a random sample of 16 to 20 households was selected in each health
facility catchment area. The analysis of the household survey in this report starts from the
assumption that household members seek care in the health facility closest to where they live, or
in other words that people living in the catchment area of a facility obtain health care in that
facility.

However it is apparent from the baseline survey data that households do not always seek care
from the closest health facility in their health zone (table 10). The household survey analysis
assigns a treatment group (PBF, C1, C2 or C3), to each household in the study, which represents
the treatment assignment of the closest health facility to the sampled household. Additionally,
both the baseline and the endline household survey included information about the name of the
health facility where the household sought reproductive health care. Using this information, we


                                                                                              28
created a variable that measures whether women sought care in a health facility consistent with
their assigned treatment group, a health facility assigned to another treatment group, and non-
randomized hospital, or a health facility outside of the study area. At baseline, for antenatal
care, for example, 44.8% of women sought care in a health facility assigned to their own
treatment group, but 11.1% sought care in a higher level hospital (not included in the
randomization conducted for the impact evaluation) and 22.2% sought care in other health
facilities beyond their own health zone (18.7% in other facilities assigned to other treatment
groups in our study sample and 3.2% in facilities not included in the study sample). Another
7.8% did not seek any antenatal care and we are missing information about the service location
for the remaining 15.7%. If we focus on women for whom we have information about the
service location, 52.3% sought care in in their “assigned? treatment group, and if we further
exclude women who did not seek any antenatal care, this percentage increases to 57.6%. This
“health care shopping? behavior whereby households bypass the closest health facility is also
present for deliveries and postnatal care: at baseline, focusing on women for whom we have
information about the service location and who sought care in a facility, only 51.9% delivered,
and only 56.1% sought postnatal care in a facility with their corresponding treatment group.

At endline, those percentages are slightly higher, but not very substantially: focusing again on
women for whom we have information about the service location and who sought care in a
facility, 60.9% obtained antenatal care, 55% delivered, and 60.6% sought postnatal care in a
facility assigned to their treatment group.

When the household is indeed seeking care in a health facility that is consistent with their
assigned treatment group, this assignment is correctly done. However, when the household seeks
care in another facility, this assignment between household and study group is potentially
erroneous, leading to measurement error. This measurement error would introduce statistical
noise in the analysis and reduce our capacity to measure potential impacts of the interventions
(attenuation bias). Another interpretation of these patterns is to see it as non-compliance with
assigned treatments. The ITT model estimated remains valid. The causal estimates the ITT
model creates may however not fully capture the causal effect of the treatment relative to a
“clean? control, but rather measure the causal impact of having a treated facility closer
compared to people living further away from a treated facility. These estimates are likely below
the true causal effect of the intervention. This is a substantial limitation of the household survey
analysis that needs to be kept in mind.

The statistical analysis and interpretation of the household survey would be further complicated
if this health care “shopping? behavior was driven or reinforced by the introduction of PBF or
the interventions implemented in C1 (additional financing) and C2 (enhanced supervision). If
this was the case, this could introduce a bias in the estimates going further than the attenuation
bias described above. Tables 11 to 13 investigate whether the implementation of PBF or the
other interventions have directly influenced household’s health care seeking behaviors. For
antenatal care, deliveries and postnatal care, they report results from multinomial logit
difference-in-differences regression models where the four options for the household are: not
seeking care, seeking care at the assigned facility, i.e. the closest one in the health zone, seeking
care in an unassigned facility, i.e. another facility of the same level potentially randomized into
a different impact evaluation group, and seeking care at a non-randomized facility, generally a
higher level hospital which were not included in the randomization.

Overall, the results do not suggest that the health care seeking behavior is driven or even
significantly influenced by the introduction of PBF or the other interventions in C1 and C2. We
also conducted this analysis using OLS with a binary outcome equal to 1 if the respondent
sought care in a health facility in their assigned treatment group, and zero otherwise. We found
no evidence that health care shopping was affected by PBF in this analysis, consistent with the
results from the multinomial logit (Appendix E). Health care shopping behavior by households
was widespread in Cameroon at baseline in 2012 and continues to be widespread at endline in
2015, but does not appear to be a consequence of the introduction of PBF. We therefore decided
to keep the presentation of the household survey results in which the analysis assumes that
household members seek care in the health facility closest to where they live. We recognize that
this assumption is not always verified and that therefore the results might suffer from
attenuation bias. In addition to the fact that overall we did not find significant evidence that
health care seeking behavior was influenced by the introduction of PBF, the following other
considerations motivated our choice:

   1) In many cases, the data collected about which health facility was visited allowed us to
      find out whether the visited facility was the closest one, but in case it was not, did not
      allow us to ascertain to which study group the visited facility pertained.

   2) When we could ascertain to which study group the visited facility pertained, such
      bypassing behavior is clearly endogenous and assigning to the household bypassing its
      closest facility the study group of the facility actually visited would lead to endogeneity
      bias.




                                                                                                   30
     3) The results from the household survey analysis are broadly consistent with the results
        from the health facility survey analysis, which are not affected by the measurement error
        introduced by the health care shopping behavior of households.

     4) The health care shopping behavior prevalent in Cameroon is likely present in many other
        countries. Our analysis uses the same assumptions and methods as the other impact
        evaluation reports including household survey results. However, to our knowledge, the
        household survey analysis in Cameroon is, so far, the only one to have explicitly
        collected or used detailed information about the name of the facility visited by the
        household sought care. We are therefore in a position to better acknowledge this study
        limitation and document how our household survey results are potentially affected by
        this health care bypassing behavior.

Household survey utilization results

Table 13 below displays the difference-in-differences regression results for the study outcomes
related to health care received during pregnancy as assessed in the household survey
interviewing women with recent pregnancies or birth experiences. In the tables below, the post
indicator can be interpreted as the change in the outcome over the study period in the control
group. Each of the interaction terms can be interpreted as the difference between the change
observed in each treatment group respectively compared to the change in the control group.
Table 14 below shows that overall few treatment effects were observed for study outcomes
related to care during pregnancy in the household survey data. Among women who had been
pregnant in the 24 months before the survey, there was an overall increase of approximately five
percentage points in delivery with a skilled birth attendant. There was no difference between the
control group and the PBF group, or the group that received additional financing in the change
in skilled delivery over the study period. However, skilled delivery declined (-0.050*, p-value =
0.087) in the group receiving only improved supervision relative to the control group.

The change between 2012 and 2015 in the percentage of women who received at least two
antenatal care visits was not statistically significant in the control group. Similar to delivery
care, there was no difference between the change in the control group and the PBF and
additional financing groups but the change among women in the improved supervision group
was less than the change observed in the full control group (-0.044**, p-value = 0.022). There
was very little change over the study period in receipt of tetanus vaccine during pregnancy, and
there was no difference in the change in vaccine receipt between the three treatment groups, and
the control group. Postnatal care receipt increased by over ten percentage points over the study
period in control group (0.105, p-value = 0.001). Compared to the control group, there was a
smaller increase over time in postnatal care in the three treatment groups; however this
difference was not statistically significant in the PBF group and the additional financing group.
Postnatal care receipt increased by seven percentage points less in the improved supervision
group (C2) than in the control group, and this difference was statistically significant (-0.070, p-
value = 0.075). Results from testing the equality of coefficients show that for skilled delivery

                                                                                                                                  32
the additional financing intervention outperformed the PBF group. For antenatal care, facilities
with the PBF intervention performed better than those facilities with only additional supervision.

To further investigate the influence if healthcare bypassing behavior, we conducted additional
analyses for key indicators dividing the sample into high and low bypass strata. We specifically
tested whether the effect of the treatment groups differed in catchment areas where are larger
proportion of women sought care outside of their treatment group health facility at baseline. To
do this, we generated a binary variable = 1 if the women went to her assigned health facility at
baseline and = 0 if she did not, and collapsed the data at the health facility level taking the mean
of the bypass indicator variable. We then merged onto the original file so that for each woman in
the dataset we know the proportion of women in her catchment area who went to their assigned
facility at baseline. Then we divided the sample into high bypassing (above the median) and low
bypassing (below the median), conducted the analysis in the separate groups, and compared the
coefficients on the three interaction terms between groups. We included antenatal care, skilled
delivery and postnatal care in this analysis.

The hypothesis behind these additional analyses is that if there are spillovers, we should see
larger treatment effects in areas with low bypass rates. The only difference in the results
between high and low bypassing areas was effect of additional financing was negative (-0.108)
in the high bypassing group and positive in the low bypassing group (0.045), and this difference
was statistically significant (p=0.058) (results shown in Appendix F). Otherwise the impacts of
the different interventions tested did not vary according to whether health care bypassing
behavior was high or moderate at baseline. This analysis further suggests that the bypassing
behavior observed in Cameroon, while substantial, did not significantly bias our impact
measures.

† Results from difference-in-differences regression models examining the effect of PBF on modern contraceptive
use among female respondents of reproductive age (15 – 49) included in the household survey. Regression model
adjusted for individual (age, marital status, education level, religion, ethnicity, working status and type of work)
and household control variables (number of individuals in the household, housing type, house ownership, water
source, and type of sanitation). Standard errors were clustered at the health facility level.

Mothers or primary care givers of all children under five years of age were asked about their
child’s vaccination history. For all children with a vaccine card, study enumerators recorded all
documented vaccinations and their respective receipt dates. Mothers/primary caretakers were
also asked to report any vaccinations that were not recorded in the vaccine card. For these
questions, enumerators asked a separate question for each vaccine type that referenced the
vaccine name and also gave an indication of its method of administration (i.e. for polio “that is
drops in the mouth?) as a guide for respondents. Only children between 12 – 23 months of age
were included in these analyses. Both outcomes include the following vaccines: oral polio
vaccine, yellow fever, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (DTC), measles, and Bacillus
Calmette–Guérin (BCG). Table 16 shows that among children with a vaccine card, there was an
almost 13 percentage point increase in full vaccination over the study period (0.127, p-value =
0.080). In the PBF group, there was a further 17 percentage point increase in full vaccination
(0.170, p-value = 0.076). There was no difference between the control group, and the additional
funding and additional supervision groups in full vaccination as documented in vaccination
records. The second vaccination outcome included both documented vaccine receipt as well as
any self-reported vaccines. This outcome displayed a similarly large increase in the control
group (0.108, p-value = 0.039). Additionally, there was a further 16.4 percentage point increase
in full vaccination over the study period in the PBF group (p-value = 0.019). Finally, neither the
additional funding, nor the additional supervision group showed an increase in full vaccination
beyond the increase in the control group. The p-values directly comparing the PBF group with
the other groups (C1 and C2) further indicate that the PBF group outperformed the three other
study groups.

The next two outcomes assessed from the household survey were growth monitoring in the
month before the survey, and having slept under a bednet the night before the survey. Both
outcomes were assessed among children under five years of age; however, children who were
less than 12 months old were not included in the growth monitoring analysis. There was no
change in growth monitoring during the study period in the control group. Similarly growth
monitoring did not increase in the PBF and the additional supervision groups. However, growth
monitoring increased by approximately 3 percentage points more in the group that received
additional funding (0.031*, p-value = 0.071) than the control group. The proportion of children
who slept under a bednet the night before the survey declined by almost 19 percentage points
during the study period (-0.186, p-value = 0.000). A similar decline was observed in all the
treatment groups as shown by the small and non-statistically significant coefficients on the
interaction terms. Results from testing the equality of coefficients showed that the additional
financing group performed better than the PBF group in growth monitoring. It should be noted
that neither growth monitoring nor bednet distribution were included in the package of services
incentivized in the PBF program.

Anthropometrics

The height and weight of all children under 5 years of age was recorded during both baseline
and endline surveys. Though nutrition indicators were not incentivized in the Cameroon PBF
program until 2015, we used the height and weight data collected in the household survey to
assess the effect of PBF on child nutrition outcomes. Using the WHO child growth standard’s
Stata package, we calculated a z-score for child height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-
height. These z-scores represent the location where each child falls according to international
standards defining healthy child development. Using these scores we calculated the prevalence
of stunting (height-for-age of less than -2 standard deviations from the mean), underweight
(weight-for-age of less than -2 standard deviations from the mean) and wasting (weight-for-age
of less than -3 standard deviations from the mean). As shown in table 18, below, there was no
difference between the changes in prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting in the
treatment groups and the control groups. While there was no change over time in stunting and
underweight, the prevalence of wasting increased at endline compared to baseline.

Facility survey utilization results

This section describes the results of PBF on health services provision as recorded in facilities
registers. To assess the reliability of these data, we examined the health service counter-
verification data that was collected routinely as part of the PBF program design through
community client satisfaction surveys. Health service verification took place in all PBF health
facilities, as well as in health facilities in control groups C1 (additional financing) and C2
(additional supervision). Thirty-five patients were sampled for 7 health service categories each
quarter. The figure below shows the percentage of patients who were reported by health
facilities to the PBF verification terms, who were later confirmed to have received health
services at the health facility. During most quarters of the three year study period in all three
study regions, over 80% of reported patients were confirmed. The trend in confirmed patients
increased slightly over time in North-West and East, with confirmation rates above 85% in all
three regions during the final year of the study. Though we find reassuringly high quality data
among the treatment group health facilities, it is possible that facilities in the full control group
had less incentive to keep records of all services provided. Given that we did not verify the

                                                                                                                36
health service data collected from the full control group, we cannot investigate this possibility.
Therefore, the possibility of incomplete reporting in the full control remains a limitation of this
analysis.

The tables below display health service utilization results as assessed in the facility survey.
Facility level provision of health services in the six months before the survey took place was
assessed using patient registers from study health facilities. All data was collected at the
monthly level; therefore, the interaction term coefficients represent differences between groups
in the change in monthly services provided. Table 19 below displays results from health facility
provision of pregnancy services. Provision of skilled delivery did not increase in the control
group during the study period. Relative to the control there were no statistical differences in
mean monthly provision of skilled delivery in the full PBF and the additional supervision group;
however, there was a relative increase of approximately 2 monthly deliveries in the additional
supervision group (additional financing 1.855, p-value = 0.071). The overall change between
2012 and 2015 in antenatal care provision in study health facilities was positive, but was not
statistically significant. Relative to the control group there was an increase in antenatal care in
all three treatment groups; however, none of these differences were statistically significant.

Comparing the six-months before the baseline, and the six months before the endline survey,
provision of tetanus toxoid vaccine declined by a monthly average of almost 17 vaccinations in
control facilities each month. Compared to the change observed in the control group, there was a
positive and statistically significant difference in the PBF and additional financing groups (PBF
21.521, p-value = 0.001; additional financing 15.989, p-value = 0.014). Compared to control
facilities, facilities with additional supervision provided on average approximately nine more
tetanus vaccines monthly to pregnant women, but this difference was not statistically significant.
Like tetanus vaccine, there was a statistically significant decline in postnatal care provision in
the control group over the study period. There were on average approximately four fewer
monthly postnatal care visits provided in control health facilities at endline compared to
baseline. Though the interaction term was positive, there was no statistical difference between
the additional supervision group and the control group. However, the change in monthly
provision of postnatal care in facilities in the PBF group and the additional financing group was
greater than the change in the control group (PBF 4.309, p-value = 0.059, additional financing
5.513, p-value = 0.016).

Table 20 below presents the results of the effect of PBF on modern contraception. Modern
contraception included women provided contraceptive implants, injectables, oral contraceptive
pills, and the intrauterine device. There was little change in the control facilities in monthly
modern contraceptive provision. In the PBF group, there was an increase of just over nine
women each month on top of the small change in the control group who were provided modern
family planning (9.240, p-value < 0.001). The change in modern contraceptive delivery in the
additional financing group is greater than the small change in the control group with
approximately six more women per month provided family planning (5.794, p-value = 0.001) in
each health facility. The change is the additional supervision group was not statistically different
from the change in the control group. This strong effect of PBF and additional financing on
family planning in the facility register data differs from the null finding we found in the
household data. The difference in the findings between data sources could be explained by
several factors. One possibility is that the household survey oversampled recently pregnant
women (because having a least one recently pregnant women in the household was an inclusion
criteria). It is possible that the need for modern family planning is less important in this
population of women among whom many have recently shown a willingness to have children. In
addition, there is some evidence that women might have been uncomfortable disclosing their use
of family planning in the household survey. For example, we find that 47% of women report
that their husbands are against use of FP to avoid pregnancy, and these women may not have
been comfortable discussing family planning in their household.

Table 21 displays the results of the impact of PBF on provision of childhood vaccines. In
general vaccine provision in the six months before the baseline declined as compared to
provision in the six months before the endline, as demonstrated by the negative and statistically
significant coefficients on the post indicators for all three vaccine outcomes in the table below.
This decline has been explained by Ministry of Health officials as resulting from country level
stock-outs during the months before the endline. Despite these large declines, the facility results
for vaccine provision may not be inconsistent with the household vaccine coverage results,
which showed large increases over time, and a particularly large change in the PBF group.
According to the recommended vaccine schedule, most childhood vaccines should be received
between birth and 12 months of age. To avoid including infants who, due to their age, should
not yet have finished their vaccine schedule, household level coverage only included children
between 12 – 23 months old. Consequently, the children included in the household data would
have received vaccinations prior to the months covered in the facility level data at endline (i.e.
before the vaccine stock-out). Both sets of results show that the PBF group, and to a lesser
degree, the additional financing group, performed much better than the control group. Therefore,
the findings from the household and facility data showing large and statistically significant
differences between groups are consistent, and we believe that the level changes can be
explained by a country level shock affecting vaccine availability that affected the facility, but
not the household data.

Facility-level provision of the third dose of polio vaccine decreased by approximately five
vaccines per month in the control group. There was an increase of 4.583 final polio vaccinations
relative to the control group in the PBF group, and this difference was statistically significant
(p=0.035). The coefficient on the interaction term was also positive in the additional financing
group but the difference was not statistically significant, and there was no difference between
the control and the additional supervision groups. There was a large and statistically significant
decline in meningitis vaccination provision over the study period (-45.970, p-value < 0.001). Of
the three treatment groups, only the change in the additional financing group was statistically
different from the control group (21.931, p-value 0.050). Finally, in the control group measles
vaccine provision declined by an average of approximately four children per month over the
study period. There was no difference between the change observed in the control group, and the
changes in the treatment groups.

Facility register data also contained data documenting facility provision of HIV-related services.
We found a large and statistically significant effect of both PBF and additional financing on
HIV testing. An average of 61 more patients were tested for HIV in PBF facilities than control
facilities, and 51 more patients were tested monthly in the additional financing arm compared to
the control. There was very little change in HIV testing in the additional supervision group, and
the effect of PBF was greater than the effect of additional supervision. Though there was a small
increase in PMTCT in all of the treatment groups relative to the full control, none of these
differences were statistically significant, and there was no different between the effect of PBF
and the other treatment groups. Similarly, there was no difference in the change in ART
provision between the treatment groups and the full control.

Health care spending

All household members were asked if they had been sick in the four weeks before the survey.
Mothers or caregivers responded on behalf of household children. All respondents who had been
sick were asked if they had gone to any health facility, health personnel or traditional healer to
seek care for this illness. Respondents were then asked how much the household spent out-of-
pocket for the treatment of this recent illness. Table 23 below presents the results for several
different types of reported spending. Neither the change in the control group on spending for
official provider fees, nor the differences between the treatment groups and the control group
were statistically significant. There was an increase of approximately 2052 CFA ($3.31) in the
amount of unofficial provider fees paid in the control group between 2012 and 2015. The
difference between the PBF group and the control group in the change over the study period was
-2254 CFA ($3.64), and this difference was statistically significant. Relative to the control
group, unofficial payments also declined in the additional financing group and the additional
supervision group; however, these differences were not statistically significant. There was a
non-significant increase of approximately 1048.64 CFA ($1.69) in laboratory and x-ray fees
over time in the control group. Compared to the control group, laboratory and x-rays fees
declined by 1473.44 CFA ($2.38), and this difference was statistically significant (p-value =
0.060). Finally, transportation fees did not change between 2012 and 2015 in the control group.
There was a statistically significant difference between the control group, and the additional
financing group with a decrease of 495.14 or $0.80. Comparing the differences between PBF
and the other treatment groups, we find that the decline in lab and x-ray fees in the PBF group
was greater than the decline observed in C1.

Satisfaction with antenatal care

Table 26, below, provides an overview of participants in the ANC exit interviews at baseline.
The average age of respondents was just over 25 years, 75 percent of respondents were married
at the time of the interview, and 72 percent were literate. As shown in Table 26 below, the
intervention arms were well balanced across all of these dimensions. There is, however,
evidence of differences in education. In particular, women attending facilities in the additional
financing arm were significantly more likely to have attended higher education than were
women attending other facilities (p<0.05).

Women were asked a series of twelve questions related to their satisfaction with individual
elements of their visits including, for example, their satisfaction with costs, wait times, and
health worker communication. For each, a statement was read, and women were asked if they
agreed, were neutral, or they disagreed. Binary variables were created by coding responses as
“1? if a woman agreed, and “0? otherwise. Overall satisfaction scores were calculated by
averaging over these twelve components. An overall score of “1? indicates that a woman agreed
with all twelve questions, while a score of “0? indicates that she either disagreed or was neutral
on all twelve questions.

The impact of the interventions on overall satisfaction are shown in Table 27 below. There is no
indication that satisfaction changed over time in the control group (β = 0.006, p = 0.847).
Relative to the pure control, the PBF group was associated with an 8.6 percentage point increase
in satisfaction (p = 0.077). The results suggest a stronger effect in the full PBF than in the
additional supervision group (10.5-percentage point increase).

† Results from difference-in-differences regression model examining the effect of PBF on the overall satisfaction
score for antenatal care reported by patients during facility exit interviews. Regression model adjusted for
individual (age, literacy, marital status, education level) and facility-level control variables (type of health facility
public/private/religious, urban/rural). Standard errors were clustered at the health facility level.

Tables 28 – 30 show the breakdown of the twelve individual components of satisfaction.
Regression results indicate the percentage point increase or decrease in probability that a
respondent in a given intervention group will agree with a statement, relative to the pure control,
after adjusting for individual-level indicators (age, literacy, marital status, and education level)
and facility-level indicators (type of health facility public/private/religious, urban/rural).

Table 28 focuses on the costs associated with care. For the first three dependent variables
reporting whether women found the fees reasonable, while few of the results meet the 10
percent cutoff for statistical significance, women in the PBF group are consistently more likely
to say that fees are reasonable than either the full control or partial treatment groups. The only
statistically significant difference among these fee-related variables was that women in the PBF
group were more likely to agree that medicine fees were reasonable than women in the
additional financing and improved supervision groups. The final column of Table 28 relates to
informal payments. There were no differences between groups in the likelihood that women
agreed with the statement that health workers did not ask for additional presents or payments.

Table 29 focuses on women’s satisfaction with health facility characteristics. PBF is associated
with a large and statistically significant 24.1-percentage point difference from the control group
(p<0.05) in women’s satisfaction with the health facility cleanliness and facility hours. Focusing
on reported facility cleanliness, women in the PBF and the additional financing group (β=0.228,
p<0.05) both reported significantly higher levels of agreement than in the pure control group,
although these scores were not significantly different from one another. Although not meeting
the 10 percent cut-off, this pattern was also seen in response to wait times, where the PBF group
was associated with 16.1-percentage point increase over the pure control, compared to a
decrease of 5.5-percentage points in the supervision only group. The pattern is slightly different
in response to the question on privacy – while the additional supervision group continued to
underperform relative to the pure control, the point estimate of the difference between the PBF
and pure control is almost 0, while the additional financing group reported the highest rate of
satisfaction. However, none of these estimates achieve statistical significance. The results for the
adequacy of hours are consistent with the pattern observed earlier. Compared to the control
group, PBF results in a large and statistically significant 15.4-percentage point increase
satisfaction with the facility’s hours, while the additional supervision is associated with a non-
significant reduction in satisfaction relative to the pure control. As indicated by the p-value on
PBF versus the improved supervision, PBF performed consistently and significantly better than
the improved supervision group on facility cleanliness, and adequacy of hours.

Table 30 provides an overview of women’s reported satisfaction with health worker
characteristics. Women attending facilities receiving the full PBF intervention reported
significantly higher levels of satisfaction with health worker communication than did women
attending control clinics (β=0.106, p<0.05), but there was no evidence of an impact of PBF on
the courteousness of health staff, time with health workers, or the ease of getting prescribed
medicines. Women attending facilities receiving additional financing reported significantly
higher levels of satisfaction with the amount of time they spent with health workers than women

than the change in the PBF group (which was negative relative to the control group).

Satisfaction with child health consultations (< 5 years old)

Table 31, below, provides an overview of participants in the child health consultation exit
interviews at baseline. The mean age of children attending facilities in the PBF arm was 23.7
months, which is older, on average, than those attending facilities in other arms (p<0.05). The
youngest group was those attending facilities in the additional financing arm (mean age: 14.2
months). The intervention arms are well balanced on gender, with females accounting for
approximately 51 percent of children attending the facilities.

Looking at the caretaker characteristics, those in the control group were more likely to be single
(16 percent, compared to a sample mean of 20 percent), while those in the PBF group were least
likely to be married (60 percent, compared to a sample mean of 73 percent). Few (3 percent,
overall) were divorced or widowed, and the treatment arms were well balanced on literacy and
education. Approximately 75 percent of the caretakers were literate (low: 69 percent in the
improved supervision arm; high: 77 percent in the additional financing and pure control arms).
The majority of women had some education, with most stopping during primary school (39
percent) or secondary level 1 (30 percent).

Caretakers were asked a series of twelve questions related to their satisfaction with individual
elements of visits. These questions were the same as those asked following antenatal visits and
included, for example, their satisfaction with costs, wait times, and health worker
communication. For each, a statement was read and women were asked if they agreed, were
neutral, or they disagreed. Binary variables were created by coding responses as “1? if a woman
agreed, and “0? otherwise. Overall satisfaction scores were calculated by averaging over these
twelve components. An overall score of “1? indicates that a woman agreed with all twelve
questions, while a score of “0? indicates that she either disagreed or was neutral on all twelve
questions. Results are shown in Table x below.

We find evidence that PBF had a positive impact on overall satisfaction with child health
services (Table 32). Relative to the pure control, the PBF was associated with a statistically
significant 9.9-percentage point increase in satisfaction (p<0.05). As was the case with the ANC
exit interviews, we find a stronger effect in the full PBF than in the additional financing group
(5.4 percentage point increase relative to full control) or supervision group (2.2-percentage point
increase), and neither of the partial treatments achieves statistical significance at the 10 percent
cutoff. While PBF and the additional financing group are not statistically significantly different
from one another, the 7.7-percentage point difference in reported satisfaction between the PBF
and the enhanced supervision (C2) group is statistically significant (p<0.10).

† Results from difference-in-differences regression model examining the effect of PBF on the overall satisfaction
score for child health consultations reported by mothers during facility exit interviews. Regression model adjusted
for individual (child age, child sex, maternal literacy, marital status, education level) and facility-level control
variables (type of health facility public/private/religious, urban/rural). Standard errors were clustered at the health
facility level.

Tables 33 – 35 show the breakdown of the twelve individual components of satisfaction. Point
estimates indicate the percentage point increase or decrease in probability that a respondent in a
given intervention group will agree with a given statement, relative to the pure control, after
adjusting for individual-level indicators (age, literacy, marital status, and education level) and
facility-level indicators (availability of electricity, availability of piped water, availability of
latrine, facility open 24 hours, type of health facility, urban/rural status, and number of health
workers employed at the facility).

Table 35 focuses on the costs associated with care. All three groups are associated with
statistically significantly higher satisfaction with laboratory fees relative to the pure control.
However, they are not significantly different from one another. The additional financing control
had the highest (non-significant 11.1-percentage point) estimated impact on satisfaction with
medicine costs; however, none of the differences between the control and treatment groups were
statistically significant for this outcome. There was no difference between any of the
intervention arms, and the control group in satisfaction with registration fees, and informal
payments.

adjusted for individual (child age, child sex, maternal literacy, marital status, education level) and facility-level

As shown in Table 34, PBF is associated with a large and statistically significant impact on
satisfaction with the health facility cleanliness (β=0.227, p=0.090). Neither the additional
financing nor the additional supervision intervention groups (C1 and C2) performed better on
cleanliness at endline than they did at baseline. Focusing on waiting times, all of the intervention
arms appear to result in improvements over the control group, although none of the differences
were statistically significant. All of the arms also resulted in increased satisfaction with the
privacy at health facilities, and the very large point estimate on the PBF (33.6 percentage points)
is significant at p<0.01. Satisfaction with the opening hours did not change over time in any of
the treatment groups, and there were no differences between groups for this outcome.

† Results from difference-in-differences regression models examining the effect of PBF on satisfaction with health
facility characteristics reported by mothers during facility exit interviews. Regression model adjusted for individual
(child age, child sex, maternal literacy, marital status, education level) and facility-level control variables (type of
health facility public/private/religious, urban/rural). Standard errors were clustered at the health facility level.

Table 35 provides an overview of caretakers’ reported satisfaction with health worker
characteristics. PBF does not appear to have had any impact on health staff courteousness (β = -
0.012), and the point estimates on the two partial treatments indicate a negative impact on health
worker courteousness, relative to the pure control. All three intervention groups have negative,
but not statistically significant, point estimates on satisfaction with the time spent with health
workers, compared to the pure control. By contrast, all three were associated with positive but
non-statistically significant impacts on the ease of getting prescribed medications. Overall,
standard errors are large relative to point estimates and, across these variables, no statistically
significant differences could be seen between groups, either between the pure control and the
three intervention groups or between the different intervention arms themselves.

Health worker satisfaction and motivation

In all, 434 health workers were interviewed at baseline. Key characteristics are described in
Table 36, below. The mean age of health workers was approximately 39 years and, on average,
workers had been employed at the facility for between 4.4 (improved supervision) and 6.2 years
(control; statistically different with p< 0.05). Approximately two-thirds of health workers were
female, and 75 percent had received either basic or level 2 secondary education. Just under half
of workers were employed by the Ministry of health, with the remaining employed by
religiously affiliated health facilities (19 percent) the facility (16 percent) or other employers (20
percent).

Health workers were read a series of statements relating to their wellbeing over the two weeks
prior to the survey. These statements were taken from the World Health Organization’s (WHO)
Well-being Index (Appendix G) and included, for example, “In the last two weeks, I have felt
active and vigorous.? For each question, health workers were asked to indicate whether the
statement described their state most of the time, more than half the time, less than half the time,
only rarely, or never. For the purposes of analysis, these data were recoded into binary
indicators. Responses were coded as “0? if the health worker replied half the time or less, and
“1? otherwise. Thus, point estimates on the postXintervention arms indicate the percentage point
increase or decrease in probability that a respondent in a given intervention group reported that a
given statement was true at least half the time, relative to the pure control, after adjusting for
individual-level indicators (age, sex, marital status, and education level) and facility-level
indicators (availability of electricity, availability of piped water, availability of latrine, facility
open 24 hours, type of health facility, urban/rural status, and number of health workers
employed at the facility).

Overall, the data do not provide strong evidence that PBF affected attributes included in the
WHO’s wellbeing index (Table 37). Point estimates are generally small relative to standard
errors, and there are no statistical differences between the pure control and the other intervention
groups. However, the change in index score for three items – Active and energetic in the last 2
weeks, Refreshed and rested in the morning in the last 2 weeks, and Days filled with interesting
things in the last 2 weeks was lower in the PBF group than the additional financing group.

Health workers were also asked a series of 26 questions related to their satisfaction with
working conditions. These questions covered a range of topics, including relationships with
individuals within and outside of the health facility, facility infrastructure and readiness to
deliver services, salary and benefits, and their overall capacity to provide high-quality health
services. For each question, a score of “1? indicates satisfaction, while a “0? indicates that a
health worker reported either indifference or dissatisfaction. Point estimates, thus, indicate the
percentage point increase or decrease in probability that a respondent in a given intervention
group is satisfied with a particular issue, relative to the pure control, after adjusting for

employed at the facility).

There is little evidence of impact on working relationships (Table 38). The additional financing
arm had the largest estimated impact on the relationship between the facility and District or
Ministry of Health staff, but at 12.7 percentage points, this did not meet the 10-percent cutoff for
significance. The PBF point estimate for an impact on the relationship with District or Ministry
of Health staff is also positive and fairly large (β=0.103), but not statistically significant. The
impact on intra-facility working relationships was estimated to be negative, though not
statistically significant, in all treatment groups. Satisfaction with working relationships between
management and staff within the facilities declined in both the PBF and the supervision arms.
Additionally, working relationships with management staff improved in C1 compared to the
PBF group. There was no difference between the change in the control group and the change in
the intervention groups in satisfaction with collaboration with the regional health delegation, or
in the quality of the management of the health facility.

† Results from difference-in-differences regression models examining the effect of PBF on internal facility

Table 39, below, provides impact estimates on relationships with the communities. There is no
strong evidence of an impact either on the relationships between the facility and local leaders or
on health workers’ perceptions of their own status within the community. In both cases, we
report a negative but not statistically significant effect of both the PBF and the improved
supervision interventions. The point estimates within the financing arms are positive and, in the
case of relationships with local leaders, relatively large at 9.3 percentage points, but they are not
statistically significant. There was also no evidence of a difference in impact between the

By contrast, we see a large and consistent impact on health workers’ satisfaction with the
quantity and quality of equipment and other supplies at health facilities, shown in Table 40,
below. Both the PBF and the additional financing arms result in similarly large and highly
significant improvements in these measures: an approximately 20 percentage point increase in
reported satisfaction with the quantity of equipment (p<0.05), approximately 25 percentage
point increase in reported satisfaction with the quality of equipment (p<0.05), and a 33 to 40
percentage point increase in satisfaction with the availability of other supplies at the health
facilities within these two arms (p<0.01). By contrast, there was less evidence of an impact in
the improved supervision arm. While point estimates are positive, they are not statistically
significant at the 10 percent cut-off level. There is also less evidence for an effect on the quality
and quantity of medicines. Although the two arms that include additional revenue – the PBF and
the financing only arms – both result in positive point estimates, they do not achieve statistical
significance.

Table 41, below, provides an overview of reported satisfaction with the physical condition of
health facilities. Health workers in the PBF arm were 31 percentage points more likely to be
satisfied with the physical condition of the health facility building, relative to the pure control
(p<0.01). While both the financing and the improved supervision arms had positive point values
(10.6 percentage points and 9.6 percentage points, respectively), neither was statistically
significant at the 10 percent cut-off, and workers in the full PBF arm were more likely to
express satisfaction than were workers in either the additional financing (p<0.05) or the
improved supervision (p<0.10) arms.

Despite increased satisfaction with both the physical infrastructure and the quantity and quality
of equipment, PBF did not have a statistically significant impact on health workers’ perceptions
of their ability to provide high-quality care. The effects associated with the two partial treatment
arms also failed to achieve statistical significance.

The interventions including financial support also appear to have positively impacted
satisfaction with salary and benefits (Table 42). Health workers in the PBF arm were 9.1 percent
points more likely to express satisfaction with their salary and 18.3 percentage points more
likely to express satisfaction with their benefits (although only the latter was statistically
significant (p<0.05)). Effects were even stronger in the additional financing group. Health
workers at facilities receiving additional financing were 13.4 percentage points more likely to be
satisfied with their salary (p< 0.10) and 28.7 percent points more likely to be satisfied with
benefits (p<0.01). These effects are not seen in the improved supervision arm. While the point
estimates associated with supervision are positive, they are relatively small and are not
statistically significant. Satisfaction with living accommodations improved somewhat in all
three groups, with point estimates suggesting that health workers were 10 to 16 percentage
points more likely to express satisfaction after the pilot. However, these impacts are not
statistically significant in any of the three groups.

The point estimates of PBF’s impact on opportunities to discuss issues with supervisors,
supervisors’ recognition of good work, opportunities to be rewarded for hard work, and
opportunities for promotion were all negative (β=-0.08, -0.04, -0.02 and -0.11, respectively),
although none were statistically significant. The estimated impact of the improved supervision
arm was also generally negative and, with a point estimate of -25.1 percentage points, the
impact of the improved supervision on opportunities for promotion was statistically significant
(p<0.05). The estimated impact of the financing arm was positive, but was only statistically
significant for the opportunity to be rewarded for hard work. The improvement in the financing
arm was greater than the change in the in the PBF group for this outcome, and for opportunities
for promotion.

As shown in Table 44, the PBF intervention had a small but negative estimated impact on
reported opportunities to upgrade skills through training and a small but positive estimated
impact on reported opportunities to use skills on the job (neither measure met statistical
significance). Point estimates for both measures were positive in the additional financing arm,
and the financing appears to have positively impacted satisfaction with opportunities to use
skills on the job (β =0.194, p< 0.10). The point estimates associated with the improved
supervision arm to either use or upgrade skills did not meet the 10 percent cut-off for statistical
significance.

Satisfaction with the safety and security in the community and with available schooling for
children were unchanged by the interventions. The point estimate in the PBF group was large at
13.9 percentage points, but did not reach statistical significance. The point estimates for the
other two treat groups were small and non-significant.

Health workers were also asked about their satisfaction with jobs, overall. While all three
interventions had positive point estimates, none met the 10 percent cut-off for statistical
significance. Relative to the pure control, the largest impact was seen in the PBF arm, with
health workers 10.5 percent more likely to express satisfaction, followed by the supervision only
group (5.3 percent more likely to express satisfaction), followed by the financing only group
(4.8 percent more likely).

Health worker availability in the health facility



                                                                                                                       56
The facility survey asked the head of the health facility, or the most informed staff member, to
list the names of the all of the health workers employed at the health facility. The staff roster
also collected information on the post occupied by each health worker and on whether they were
present on the day of data collection. Table 45 below presents results from analysis of the
number of nurses present at the health facility on the day of data collection. There was a small
and non-significant increase in the number of nurses present over the study period. The increase
in the number of nurses in the PBF group was greater than in the full control group (p-value
0.010). Adding the coefficient on the interaction term of PBF and post to the coefficient on the
post indicator (0.191+1.222=1.413) indicates that there was an average increase of almost 1.5
nurses present in PBF facilities over the study period. The coefficients on the two other
treatment groups – additional financing and additional supervision – were not statistically
significant; however, there was a larger increase in the full PBF group compared to the change
in the additional supervision group.

Drugs and equipment in the health facility

A composite indicator was created to assess any impact on the availability of basic clinical
equipment (Table 46). The indicator included information on the presence of a clock, a child
weighing scale, height measure, tape measure, adult weighing scale, blood pressure instrument,
thermometer, stethoscope, fetoscope, otoscope, flashlight, stretcher, and wheelchair. Scores
indicate the proportion of these thirteen pieces of equipment that was available at a given facility
and range from 0 to 1. Point estimates indicate the estimated impact on this score.

Both the PBF and the additional financing intervention arms resulted in large and statistically
significant improvements in the availability of equipment. Facilities in the PBF arm had a 10.0
percentage point increase over that seen in the control (p<0.05), while those in the additional
financing arm had an increase of 12.5 percentage points over the control (p < 0.01). This
increase was not seen in the improved supervision arm; while the point estimate was positive, it
was small and not statistically significant. There was no measurable difference in the impacts of
the PBF and financing only arms, but there was statistically significant difference between the
PBF intervention and improved supervision (p<0.05).

The quality of consultations for children under 5 years of age

Enumerators observed a total of 575 child health consultations. For each, enumerators compared
the exchange against a standardized checklist and noted whether the health worker performed
the following eleven routine activities: greeted the patient, washed hands, asked age, duration of
the complaint, if the child is able to drink or breastfeed, if the child vomits everything, if the
child is lethargic, if the child took any medicine and if the child had diarrhea. An overall quality
score was calculated for each visit by calculating the proportion of these activities that was
conducted.

As shown in Table 53, there is no evidence of impact in any of the three intervention groups.
Both the PBF and the improved supervision groups have small but negative point estimates with
large standard errors and, while the additional financing group has a positive estimated impact
(4 percentage points), this too fails to meet the cut-off for statistical significance.

The quality of antenatal care

Enumerators observed 725 ANC consultations. They compared each exchange against a
standardized checklist and noted whether the health worker performed the following eleven
routine activities: took a background,2 asked about past issues,3 asked about current issues,4
provided iron supplementation, gave advice about warning signs,5 helped to prepare for the
birth,6 checked HIV status, tested for syphilis, provided malaria prophylaxis, discussed
appropriate nutrition, and checked the following vital signs: blood pressure, weight, conjunctiva,
hemoglobin, rhesus, urine glucose, uterine size, fetal heartbeat and fetal presentation. As with
the child health consultations, these data were used to calculate aggregate quality scores.
National protocols provide guidelines for care that is specific to the number of prior visits and
gestational age of the pregnant women. As not all activities are appropriate for all consultation,
the quality indices were adjusted to reflect variations by gestational age (<32 weeks, 32 to 35
weeks, and >35 weeks) and whether or not the patient was experiencing her first pregnancy.
Results are presented in Table 54.

We see a strong positive trend in the quality of ANC over time. On average, consultation scores
improved by improved by 12.9 percentage points between baseline and endline (p<0.05). As
shown in Table 54, there were no differences in any of the treatment groups in the change in
ANC quality relative to the full control.

Discussion

Health sector context

Despite being one of the wealthier countries in the Central African region, and the country’s
relatively high health spending of $59 per capita in 2014 (The World Bank 2016b), Cameroon’s
health indicators resemble countries that spend much less on health care (ICF International
2012). Although the health sector budget has more than doubled in recent years, the lion’s share
of resources has been allocated for administration, rather than to the front lines where health
services are provided. This has resulted in a scarcity of funds to meet operating expenses
incurred in the day-to-day business of a district health system (e.g., consumables, drugs, regular
maintenance, community outreach, etc.).

In order to more directly link payments and funding at the provider level with the quantity and
quality of health services performed, after an initial pilot in the Littoral region, Cameroon
started a PBF pilot in 2012 in 14 districts in three regions of the country: East, South East and
South West. Performance-based financing is a health systems management tool designed to
increase the efficiency of health system inputs to improve the coverage and quality of priority
maternal and child health services by paying health facilities bonuses linked to the quantity and
quality of services delivered.


Impact evaluation design and research questions

The PBF pilot was accompanied by a prospective randomized impact evaluation. In order to
distinguish the influence of the different components of the PBF reform, the evaluation
compared four arms: (1) the standard PBF package, (2) the same level of financing but not
linked to performance, and with the same levels of supervision, monitoring, and autonomy as
PBF, (3) no additional resources or autonomy, but the same levels of supervision and
monitoring as PBF, and (4) pure comparison. The randomization took place at the health facility
level and overall the four study groups were well balanced at baseline. The analysis also
established that the levels of financing between the first two groups (standard PBF and
additional financing) was indeed equivalent at endline. The evaluation used a combination of
household and health facility surveys conducted at baseline and endline to assess the impact of
the interventions.

The impact evaluation focused on the following principal research questions:

1. Does the PBF program increase the coverage of MCH services?

   2. Does the PBF program increase the quality of MCH services delivered?

   3. Is it the enhanced monitoring & evaluation and supervision or the link between payments
      and results that leads to improvements observed in quality or coverage?

   4. What is the contribution of enhanced supervision and monitoring to improving MCH
      service coverage and quality in the absence of increased autonomy or additional
      financial resources?

The discussion is structured around these main research questions, starting the coverage of
MCH services, followed by the quality of those services. We then regroup questions 3 and 4
above into a discussion of the differences in the measured impacts of the three intervention
arms. We end by discussing the study limitations.


                                                                                                64
MCH Coverage indicators

For the PBF arm (arm 1), results from the health facility survey analysis show significant
increases in coverage of the childhood vaccinations (including the polio 3 vaccine) and maternal
immunization against tetanus as well as the coverage of modern methods of family planning. In
the household survey analyses, child vaccination was the only indicator with a statistically
significant increase in the PBF group (17 percentage points, p=0.076), but these results at the
household level should be interpreted with caution due to the high degree of facility bypassing
observed in the data with close to half of households seeking care in a non-assigned health
facility. The results from the household survey analysis are however broadly consistent with the
results from the health facility survey analysis which are not affected by the measurement error
introduced by the health care shopping behavior of households: indeed both analyses found no
significant changes for timely ANC and in-facility deliveries, while both analyses found that
PBF had a positive impact on child vaccinations.

The absence of impacts for indicators that were seen as priorities, such as ANC and in-facility
deliveries is surprising. We hope that the qualitative study will help us better understand why
these indicators did not move as anticipated. Potential explanations might be that the coverage
for these indicators was already relatively high at baseline in the IE districts (77% for facility-
based deliveries, 88% for ANC2) or that the Ministry of Health introduced the obstetrical kit
intervention in all facilities at the same time as PBF. It is also possible that the supply-side
incentive for providers was not sufficient given existing user fees, which might act as a barrier
on the demand-side. A discussion about combining demand-side and supply-side incentives
would then be useful, especially in light of the fact that an indicator such as skilled deliveries
has not increased more than 2% in Cameroon for the past 20 years.


Out of pocket payments
Out-of-pocket health expenditures decreased for households in the PBF arm, in particular for
unofficial provider fees (-2254 CFA or $3.64, p=0.086) and laboratory and x-rays fees declined
by (-1473.44 CFA or $2.38, p=0.06). While these effects are only measurable from the
household survey data and not from the exit interviews conducted as part of the health facility
survey, we believe that the information about out-of-pocket payments is more reliable in the
household survey than from exit interviews because respondents are generally more comfortable
discussing topics like unofficial payments in the privacy of their households.


Patient Satisfaction
The results indicate a significant increase in overall satisfaction expressed during exit interviews
among parents/care takers of children less than 5 who received child health consultations at
health facilities in the PBF arm. Similarly, there was an 8.6 percentage point increase in overall
satisfaction in the PBF group among women answering exit interviews after receiving antenatal
care is not statistically significant at conventional thresholds (p<0.1).

Direct observation
The health facility surveys included direct observations of ANC and child health consultations.
The analysis of those observations doesn’t show evidence of significant changes in the
interpersonal quality or the technical quality of ANC and child health consultations across the
different study groups.




                                                                                                  65
Equipment and Staffing
In terms of structural quality, the PBF arm (T1) as well as the additional financing arm (C1) saw
increases in the average availability of necessary equipment, particularly materials for delivery
and neonatal care.

Health worker motivation
The availability of human resources for health also appears to have improved in the PBF arm,
with more qualified health workers present on site than in the other arms as well as an increase
in their financial and non-financial job satisfaction. In particular, health worker satisfaction with
the availability of equipment, medicines, consumables and infrastructure increased. It is
important to note that the same trends were observed the group receiving additional financing
(C1).

Comparison across intervention arms

Overall, the impact evaluation results reveal significant increases in the PBF arm for several
indicators (child and mother vaccinations, use of modern family planning), but not for other
such as antenatal care visits and in-facility deliveries. Structural quality as measured by
equipment availability, staff presence and staff satisfaction, improved in the PBF group.
However, despite an increase in providers and supplies available at health facilities, PBF did not
increase the completeness of service provision during antenatal care and child health
consultations. Importantly, out-of-pocket health expenditures decreased for household in the
PBF arm, including unofficial payments and this decrease in revenue did not come at the cost of
process quality: there were no negative spillover effects on completeness of services and advice
provided during antenatal visits and consultations for children under 5. Perhaps not surprisingly,
then, given decreased out of pocket costs, and improvements in structural and process quality,
client satisfaction also increased for medical consultations for children younger than 5.

While some –but not all -of the improvements measured for PBF were also observed in the
additional financing arm C1, few improvements were observed in the group C2 offering
enhanced supervision without additional financing or financial incentives. The comparison
between the PBF and the C1 group is delicate because the two interventions share many
similarities: same supervision and monitoring mechanisms, same level of managerial autonomy
and increased financing. The only difference was that in the PBF group (T1) the additional
financing was linked to the performance of the individual facility while in the C1 group it was
linked to the average performance of the PBF facilities in the same district. It is not impossible
that this distinction might not have been salient enough among the health facility management
and staff, explaining overall similar results.

The lower impacts obtained in the C2 group however suggest that reinforced supervision is not
sufficient to change behaviors and improve outcomes. Additional financing appears to be
required and its impact seems in some instances stronger when linked to results as in PBF.



Study limitations

This study has several limitations that we have tried to acknowledge in this report.

The randomization for this study was at the health facility level. This is beneficial from the point
of view of statistical power. From an operational and public health perspective, however,


                                                                                                  66
randomizing at the district level would have make more sense given the proximity of some
facilities. Indeed, the risk with facility-level randomization is that neighboring facilities from
different groups might learn from each other and apply principles outside their treatment group.
However, this was not feasible given that the Government of Cameroon had already decided and
announced which districts would be included in the PBF pilot. Randomization at the district
level was therefore not an option.

We have analyzed in detail the phenomenon of health care bypassing behavior whereby
households look for health care beyond the closest health facility. We found that health care
shopping behavior by households was widespread in Cameroon at baseline in 2012 and
continues to be widespread at endline in 2015, but does not appear to be a consequence of the
introduction of PBF. Overall, the results do not suggest that the health care seeking behavior is
driven or even significantly influenced by the introduction of PBF or the other interventions in
C1 and C2 limiting the concerns for systematic bias. However, this bypassing behavior likely
leads to estimates which are below the true causal effect of the intervention. This is a substantial
limitation of the household survey analysis that needs to be kept in mind.

While overall we found that the results from the household survey and the health facility survey
analyses were consistent, for example on the absence of impacts for the ANC and skilled
delivery indicators and the presence of positive impact on immunizations, we also noted some
discrepancies. In some cases, because of the nature of the information collected, one of the two
data collection method might be superior. For example, patients might be more open about
reporting unofficial payments in a household survey than during an exit interview conducted
within or in the vicinity of the facility. In contrast, women might be reluctant to report family
planning utilization at home and therefore facility-level data for this indicator might be more
reliable.

Another potential limitation is that the differences between the three intervention study groups
were sometimes subtle. This was certainly the case, as discussed above, between the PBF group
and the C1 group that offered all the elements of PBF except the direct link between individual
facility performance and additional financing. It is not obvious that all these differences in
intervention design have been fully grasped by staff and management. We should also
acknowledge that the monitoring of adherence to national guidelines done as part of the
monitoring and supervision intervention in T1, C1 and C2 facilities was not ideal from an
evaluation point of view because it means that all three treatment groups receive a separate
intervention which the control group does not receive. This is obviously not something that
could have easily been avoided from an implementation perspective, and it seems likely that the
impact of these protocols is small.

Finally, this report relies on quantitative household and health facility surveys. A companion
qualitative study has been conducted and its analysis is ongoing. The qualitative analysis will
help understand and interpret some of the impacts measured – or their absence – and will shed
light on possible mechanisms.

Conclusions and Policy Recommendations

From a policy point of view, these impact evaluation results suggest the following lessons.

   1) In general, PBF is an efficient mechanism to bring payments and funding at the provider
      level, leading to significant increases in coverage (child and maternal immunization,
      family planning, HIV testing) and improvements in structural quality of care. It also
      leads to a decrease in out-of-pocket payments, in particular unofficial payments.

   2) For many of those outcomes, the differences between the PBF group (T1) and the
      additional financing group (C1) are not significant. It should be noted that the C1 group
      offered all the elements of PBF except the direct link between individual facility
      performance and additional financing. It is not obvious these differences in intervention
      design have been salient enough for staff and management.

   3) There was, however, a clear effect for the importance of additional financing plus
      reinforced supervision through PBF instruments (comparing groups T1 and C1 vs groups
      C2 and C3). Enhanced supervision and monitoring are not sufficient to improve MCH
      outcomes.

   4) The absence of impacts for some MCH indicators such as skilled deliveries and ANC
      visits was surprising. It is possible that the supply-side incentives for providers were not
      sufficient given existing user fees which might act as a barrier on the demand-side. A
      policy discussion about combining demand-side and supply-side incentives would be
      useful.

   5) In terms of quality of care, most of the positive impacts were observed on structural
      quality. However, despite an increase in providers and supplies available at health
      facilities, PBF did not increase the completeness of service provision (content of care)
      during antenatal care and child health consultations. Further reflection and efforts should
      be devoted to identify mechanisms to incentivize or otherwise improve the content of
      care beyond equipment, supplies and staff availability.
